 The Doctor was in his best condition , and looked specially young . The resemblance between him and Lucie was very strong at such times , and as they sat side by side , she leaning on his shoulder , and he resting his arm on the back of her chair , it was very agreeable to trace the likeness . He had been talking all day , on many subjects , and with unusual vivacity . Pray , Doctor Manette , said Mr . Darnay , as they sat under the plane-treeand he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand , which happened to be the old buildings of Londonhave you seen much of the Tower ? 
 Lucie and I have been there ; but only casually . We have seen enough of it , to know that it teems with interest ; little more .  I have been there , as you remember , said Darnay , with a smile , though reddening a little angrily , in another character , and not in a character that gives facilities for seeing much of it . They told me a curious thing when I was there . What was that ? Lucie asked . In making some alterations , the workmen came upon an old dungeon , which had been , for many years , built up and forgotten . Every stone of its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by prisonersdates , names , complaints , and prayers . 
 Upon a corner stone in an angle of the wall , one prisoner , who seemed to have gone to execution , had cut as his last work , three letters . They were done with some very poor instrument , and hurriedly , with an unsteady hand . At first , they were read as D . I . C . ; but , on being more carefully examined , the last letter was found to be G . There was no record or legend of any prisoner with those initials , and many fruitless guesses were made what the name could have been . At length , it was suggested that the letters were not initials , but the complete word , DIG . 
 My father , exclaimed Lucie , you are ill ! He had suddenly started up , with his hand to his head . His manner and his look quite terrified them all . No , my dear , not ill . There are large drops of rain falling , and they made me start . We had better go in . He recovered himself almost instantly . Rain was really falling in large drops , and he showed the back of his hand with rain-drops on it . But , he said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told of , and , as they went into the house , the business eye of Mr . Lorry either detected , or fancied it detected , on his face , as it turned towards Charles Darnay , the same singular look that had been upon it when it turned towards him in the passages of the Court House . 
 He recovered himself so quickly , however , that Mr . Lorry had doubts of his business eye . The arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more steady than he was , when he stopped under it to remark to them that he was not yet proof against slight surprises (if he ever would be) , and that the rain had startled him . Tea-time , and Miss Pross making tea , with another fit of the jerks upon her , and yet no Hundreds of people . Mr . Carton had lounged in , but he made only Two . 
 The night was so very sultry , that although they sat with doors and windows open , they were overpowered by heat . When the tea-table was done with , they all moved to one of the windows , and looked out into the heavy twilight . Lucie sat by her father ; Darnay sat beside her ; Carton leaned against a window . The curtains were long and white , and some of the thunder-gusts that whirled into the corner , caught them up to the ceiling , and waved them like spectral wings . 
 The rain-drops are still falling , large , heavy , and few , said Doctor Manette . It comes slowly . It comes surely , said Carton . They spoke low , as people watching and waiting mostly do ; as people in a dark room , watching and waiting for Lightning , always do . There was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to get shelter before the storm broke ; the wonderful corner for echoes resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going , yet not a footstep was there . A multitude of people , and yet a solitude ! said Darnay , when they had listened for a while . 
 Is it not impressive , Mr . Darnay ? asked Lucie . Sometimes , I have sat here of an evening , until I have fanciedbut even the shade of a foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night , when all is so black and solemnLet us shudder too . We may know what it is . It will seem nothing to you . Such whims are only impressive as we originate them , I think ; they are not to be communicated . I have sometimes sat alone here of an evening , listening , until I have made the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming by-and-bye into our lives . 
 There is a great crowd coming one day into our lives , if that be so , Sydney Carton struck in , in his moody way . The footsteps were incessant , and the hurry of them became more and more rapid . The corner echoed and re-echoed with the tread of feet ; some , as it seemed , under the windows ; some , as it seemed , in the room ; some coming , some going , some breaking off , some stopping altogether ; all in the distant streets , and not one within sight . 
 Are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us , Miss Manette , or are we to divide them among us ? I don't know , Mr . Darnay ; I told you it was a foolish fancy , but you asked for it . When I have yielded myself to it , I have been alone , and then I have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come into my life , and my father's . I take them into mine ! said Carton . I ask no questions and make no stipulations . There is a great crowd bearing down upon us , Miss Manette , and I see themby the Lightning . He added the last words , after there had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window . 
 And I hear them ! he added again , after a peal of thunder . Here they come , fast , fierce , and furious ! It was the rush and roar of rain that he typified , and it stopped him , for no voice could be heard in it . A memorable storm of thunder and lightning broke with that sweep of water , and there was not a moment's interval in crash , and fire , and rain , until after the moon rose at midnight . The great bell of Saint Paul's was striking one in the cleared air , when Mr . Lorry , escorted by Jerry , high-booted and bearing a lantern , set forth on his return-passage to Clerkenwell . 
 There were solitary patches of road on the way between Soho and Clerkenwell , and Mr . Lorry , mindful of foot-pads , always retained Jerry for this service : though it was usually performed a good two hours earlier . What a night it has been ! Almost a night , Jerry , said Mr . Lorry , to bring the dead out of their graves . I never see the night myself , masternor yet I don't expect towhat would do that , answered Jerry . Good night , Mr . Carton , said the man of business . Good night , Mr . Darnay . Shall we ever see such a night again , together ! Perhaps . Perhaps , see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar , bearing down upon them , too . 
 Monseigneur , one of the great lords in power at the Court , held his fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in Paris . Monseigneur was in his inner room , his sanctuary of sanctuaries , the Holiest of Holiests to the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without . Monseigneur was about to take his chocolate . Monseigneur could swallow a great many things with ease , and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather rapidly swallowing France ; but , his morning's chocolate could not so much as get into the throat of Monseigneur , without the aid of four strong men besides the Cook . 
 Yes . It took four men , all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration , and the Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his pocket , emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneur , to conduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneur's lips . One lacquey carried the chocolate-pot into the sacred presence ; a second , milled and frothed the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function ; a third , presented the favoured napkin ; a fourth (he of the two gold watches) , poured the chocolate out . It was impossible for Monseigneur to dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high place under the admiring Heavens . 
 Deep would have been the blot upon his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three men ; he must have died of two . Monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night , where the Comedy and the Grand Opera were charmingly represented . Monseigneur was out at a little supper most nights , with fascinating company . So polite and so impressible was Monseigneur , that the Comedy and the Grand Opera had far more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and state secrets , than the needs of all France . A happy circumstance for France , as the like always is for all countries similarly favoured ! always was for England (by way of example) , in the regretted days of the merry Stuart who sold it . 
 Monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business , which was , to let everything go on in its own way ; of particular public business , Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go his waytend to his own power and pocket . Of his pleasures , general and particular , Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea , that the world was made for them . The text of his order (altered from the original by only a pronoun , which is not much) ran : The earth and the fulness thereof are mine , saith Monseigneur . 
 Yet , Monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into his affairs , both private and public ; and he had , as to both classes of affairs , allied himself perforce with a Farmer-General . As to finances public , because Monseigneur could not make anything at all of them , and must consequently let them out to somebody who could ; as to finances private , because Farmer-Generals were rich , and Monseigneur , after generations of great luxury and expense , was growing poor . Hence Monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent , while there was yet time to ward off the impending veil , the cheapest garment she could wear , and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich Farmer-General , poor in family . 
 Which Farmer-General , carrying an appropriate cane with a golden apple on the top of it , was now among the company in the outer rooms , much prostrated before by mankindalways excepting superior mankind of the blood of Monseigneur , who , his own wife included , looked down upon him with the loftiest contempt . A sumptuous man was the Farmer-General . Thirty horses stood in his stables , twenty-four male domestics sat in his halls , six body-women waited on his wife . As one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and forage where he could , the Farmer-Generalhowsoever his matrimonial relations conduced to social moralitywas at least the greatest reality among the personages who attended at the hotel of Monseigneur that day . 
 Exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding , which was at that remarkable timeand has been sinceto be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural subject of human interest , were in the most exemplary state of exhaustion , at the hotel of Monseigneur . Such homes had these various notabilities left behind them in the fine world of Paris , that the spies among the assembled devotees of Monseigneurforming a goodly half of the polite companywould have found it hard to discover among the angels of that sphere one solitary wife , who , in her manners and appearance , owned to being a Mother . 
 But , the comfort was , that all the company at the grand hotel of Monseigneur were perfectly dressed . If the Day of Judgment had only been ascertained to be a dress day , everybody there would have been eternally correct . Such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair , such delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended , such gallant swords to look at , and such delicate honour to the sense of smell , would surely keep anything going , for ever and ever . The exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they languidly moved ; these golden fetters rang like precious little bells ; and what with that ringing , and with the rustle of silk and brocade and fine linen , there was a flutter in the air that fanned Saint Antoine and his devouring hunger far away . 
 Dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all things in their places . Everybody was dressed for a Fancy Ball that was never to leave off . From the Palace of the Tuileries , through Monseigneur and the whole Court , through the Chambers , the Tribunals of Justice , and all society (except the scarecrows) , the Fancy Ball descended to the Common Executioner : who , in pursuance of the charm , was required to officiate frizzled , powdered , in a gold-laced coat , pumps , and white silk stockings . At the gallows and the wheelthe axe was a rarityMonsieur Paris , as it was the episcopal mode among his brother Professors of the provinces , Monsieur Orleans , and the rest , to call him , presided in this dainty dress . 
 And who among the company at Monseigneur's reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year of our Lord , could possibly doubt , that a system rooted in a frizzled hangman , powdered , gold-laced , pumped , and white-silk stockinged , would see the very stars out ! Monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his chocolate , caused the doors of the Holiest of Holiests to be thrown open , and issued forth . Then , what submission , what cringing and fawning , what servility , what abject humiliation ! As to bowing down in body and spirit , nothing in that way was left for Heavenwhich may have been one among other reasons why the worshippers of Monseigneur never troubled it . 
 Bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there , a whisper on one happy slave and a wave of the hand on another , Monseigneur affably passed through his rooms to the remote region of the Circumference of Truth . There , Monseigneur turned , and came back again , and so in due course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate sprites , and was seen no more . The show being over , the flutter in the air became quite a little storm , and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs . There was soon but one person left of all the crowd , and he , with his hat under his arm and his snuff-box in his hand , slowly passed among the mirrors on his way out . 
 With a wild rattle and clatter , and an inhuman abandonment of consideration not easy to be understood in these days , the carriage dashed through streets and swept round corners , with women screaming before it , and men clutching each other and clutching children out of its way . At last , swooping at a street corner by a fountain , one of its wheels came to a sickening little jolt , and there was a loud cry from a number of voices , and the horses reared and plunged . 
 But for the latter inconvenience , the carriage probably would not have stopped ; carriages were often known to drive on , and leave their wounded behind , and why not ? But the frightened valet had got down in a hurry , and there were twenty hands at the horses' bridles . What has gone wrong ? said Monsieur , calmly looking out . A tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of the horses , and had laid it on the basement of the fountain , and was down in the mud and wet , howling over it like a wild animal . 
 Pardon , Monsieur the Marquis ! said a ragged and submissive man , it is a child . Why does he make that abominable noise ? Is it his child ? Excuse me , Monsieur the Marquisit is a pityyes . The fountain was a little removed ; for the street opened , where it was , into a space some ten or twelve yards square . As the tall man suddenly got up from the ground , and came running at the carriage , Monsieur the Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt . Killed ! shrieked the man , in wild desperation , extending both arms at their length above his head , and staring at him . Dead ! 
 The people closed round , and looked at Monsieur the Marquis . There was nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness and eagerness ; there was no visible menacing or anger . Neither did the people say anything ; after the first cry , they had been silent , and they remained so . The voice of the submissive man who had spoken , was flat and tame in its extreme submission . Monsieur the Marquis ran his eyes over them all , as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes . 
 He took out his purse . It is extraordinary to me , said he , that you people cannot take care of yourselves and your children . One or the other of you is for ever in the way . How do I know what injury you have done my horses . See ! Give him that . He threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up , and all the heads craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell . The tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry , Dead ! 
 He was arrested by the quick arrival of another man , for whom the rest made way . On seeing him , the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder , sobbing and crying , and pointing to the fountain , where some women were stooping over the motionless bundle , and moving gently about it . They were as silent , however , as the men . I know all , I know all , said the last comer . Be a brave man , my Gaspard ! It is better for the poor little plaything to die so , than to live . It has died in a moment without pain . Could it have lived an hour as happily ? 
 You are a philosopher , you there , said the Marquis , smiling . How do they call you ? They call me Defarge . Of what trade ? Monsieur the Marquis , vendor of wine . Pick up that , philosopher and vendor of wine , said the Marquis , throwing him another gold coin , and spend it as you will . The horses there ; are they right ? Without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time , Monsieur the Marquis leaned back in his seat , and was just being driven away with the air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing , and had paid for it , and could afford to pay for it ; when his ease was suddenly disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage , and ringing on its floor . 
 Hold ! said Monsieur the Marquis . Hold the horses ! Who threw that ? He looked to the spot where Defarge the vendor of wine had stood , a moment before ; but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on the pavement in that spot , and the figure that stood beside him was the figure of a dark stout woman , knitting . You dogs ! said the Marquis , but smoothly , and with an unchanged front , except as to the spots on his nose : I would ride over any of you very willingly , and exterminate you from the earth . If I knew which rascal threw at the carriage , and if that brigand were sufficiently near it , he should be crushed under the wheels . 
 So cowed was their condition , and so long and hard their experience of what such a man could do to them , within the law and beyond it , that not a voice , or a hand , or even an eye was raised . Among the men , not one . But the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily , and looked the Marquis in the face . It was not for his dignity to notice it ; his contemptuous eyes passed over her , and over all the other rats ; and he leaned back in his seat again , and gave the word Go on ! 
 He was driven on , and other carriages came whirling by in quick succession ; the Minister , the State-Projector , the Farmer-General , the Doctor , the Lawyer , the Ecclesiastic , the Grand Opera , the Comedy , the whole Fancy Ball in a bright continuous flow , came whirling by . The rats had crept out of their holes to look on , and they remained looking on for hours ; soldiers and police often passing between them and the spectacle , and making a barrier behind which they slunk , and through which they peeped . 
 The father had long ago taken up his bundle and bidden himself away with it , when the women who had tended the bundle while it lay on the base of the fountain , sat there watching the running of the water and the rolling of the Fancy Ballwhen the one woman who had stood conspicuous , knitting , still knitted on with the steadfastness of Fate . The water of the fountain ran , the swift river ran , the day ran into evening , so much life in the city ran into death according to rule , time and tide waited for no man , the rats were sleeping close together in their dark holes again , the Fancy Ball was lighted up at supper , all things ran their course . 
 A beautiful landscape , with the corn bright in it , but not abundant . Patches of poor rye where corn should have been , patches of poor peas and beans , patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat . On inanimate nature , as on the men and women who cultivated it , a prevalent tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillinglya dejected disposition to give up , and wither away . 
 Monsieur the Marquis in his travelling carriage (which might have been lighter) , conducted by four post-horses and two postilions , fagged up a steep hill . A blush on the countenance of Monsieur the Marquis was no impeachment of his high breeding ; it was not from within ; it was occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his controlthe setting sun . The sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it gained the hill-top , that its occupant was steeped in crimson . It will die out , said Monsieur the Marquis , glancing at his hands , directly . 
 In effect , the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment . When the heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel , and the carriage slid down hill , with a cinderous smell , in a cloud of dust , the red glow departed quickly ; the sun and the Marquis going down together , there was no glow left when the drag was taken off .  But , there remained a broken country , bold and open , a little village at the bottom of the hill , a broad sweep and rise beyond it , a church-tower , a windmill , a forest for the chase , and a crag with a fortress on it used as a prison . Round upon all these darkening objects as the night drew on , the Marquis looked , with the air of one who was coming near home . 
 The village had its one poor street , with its poor brewery , poor tannery , poor tavern , poor stable-yard for relays of post-horses , poor fountain , all usual poor appointments . It had its poor people too . All its people were poor , and many of them were sitting at their doors , shredding spare onions and the like for supper , while many were at the fountain , washing leaves , and grasses , and any such small yieldings of the earth that could be eaten . Expressive sips of what made them poor , were not wanting ; the tax for the state , the tax for the church , the tax for the lord , tax local and tax general , were to be paid here and to be paid there , according to solemn inscription in the little village , until the wonder was , that there was any village left unswallowed . 
 Heralded by a courier in advance , and by the cracking of his postilions' whips , which twined snake-like about their heads in the evening air , as if he came attended by the Furies , Monsieur the Marquis drew up in his travelling carriage at the posting-house gate . It was hard by the fountain , and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him . He looked at them , and saw in them , without knowing it , the slow sure filing down of misery-worn face and figure , that was to make the meagreness of Frenchmen an English superstition which should survive the truth through the best part of a hundred years . 
 Monsieur the Marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that drooped before him , as the like of himself had drooped before Monseigneur of the Courtonly the difference was , that these faces drooped merely to suffer and not to propitiatewhen a grizzled mender of the roads joined the group . Bring me hither that fellow ! said the Marquis to the courier . The fellow was brought , cap in hand , and the other fellows closed round to look and listen , in the manner of the people at the Paris fountain . 
 I passed you on the road ? Monseigneur , it is true . I had the honour of being passed on the road . Coming up the hill , and at the top of the hill , both ? Monseigneur , it is true . What did you look at , so fixedly ? Monseigneur , I looked at the man . He stooped a little , and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the carriage . All his fellows stooped to look under the carriage . What man , pig ? And why look there ? Pardon , Monseigneur ; he swung by the chain of the shoethe drag . Who ? demanded the traveller . Monseigneur , the man . 
 May the Devil carry away these idiots ! How do you call the man ? You know all the men of this part of the country . Who was he ? Your clemency , Monseigneur ! He was not of this part of the country . Of all the days of my life , I never saw him . Swinging by the chain ? To be suffocated ? With your gracious permission , that was the wonder of it , Monseigneur . His head hanging overlike this ! He turned himself sideways to the carriage , and leaned back , with his face thrown up to the sky , and his head hanging down ; then recovered himself , fumbled with his cap , and made a bow . 
 What was he like ? Monseigneur , he was whiter than the miller . All covered with dust , white as a spectre , tall as a spectre ! The picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd ; but all eyes , without comparing notes with other eyes , looked at Monsieur the Marquis . Perhaps , to observe whether he had any spectre on his conscience . Truly , you did well , said the Marquis , felicitously sensible that such vermin were not to ruffle him , to see a thief accompanying my carriage , and not open that great mouth of yours . Bah ! Put him aside , Monsieur Gabelle ! 
 Monsieur Gabelle was the Postmaster , and some other taxing functionary united ; he had come out with great obsequiousness to assist at this examination , and had held the examined by the drapery of his arm in an official manner . Bah ! Go aside ! said Monsieur Gabelle . Lay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village to-night , and be sure that his business is honest , Gabelle . Monseigneur , I am flattered to devote myself to your orders . 
 Did he run away , fellow ? where is that Accursed ? The accursed was already under the carriage with some half-dozen particular friends , pointing out the chain with his blue cap . Some half-dozen other particular friends promptly hauled him out , and presented him breathless to Monsieur the Marquis . Did the man run away , Dolt , when we stopped for the drag ? Monseigneur , he precipitated himself over the hill-side , head first , as a person plunges into the river . See to it , Gabelle . Go on ! 
 The half-dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the wheels , like sheep ; the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky to save their skins and bones ; they had very little else to save , or they might not have been so fortunate . The burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the rise beyond , was soon checked by the steepness of the hill . Gradually , it subsided to a foot pace , swinging and lumbering upward among the many sweet scents of a summer night . The postilions , with a thousand gossamer gnats circling about them in lieu of the Furies , quietly mended the points to the lashes of their whips ; the valet walked by the horses ; the courier was audible , trotting on ahead into the dun distance . 
 At the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial-ground , with a Cross and a new large figure of Our Saviour on it ; it was a poor figure in wood , done by some inexperienced rustic carver , but he had studied the figure from the lifehis own life , maybefor it was dreadfully spare and thin . To this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been growing worse , and was not at its worst , a woman was kneeling . She turned her head as the carriage came up to her , rose quickly , and presented herself at the carriage-door . 
 It is you , Monseigneur ! Monseigneur , a petition . With an exclamation of impatience , but with his unchangeable face , Monseigneur looked out . How , then ! What is it ? Always petitions ! Monseigneur . For the love of the great God ! My husband , the forester . What of your husband , the forester ? Always the same with you people . He cannot pay something ? He has paid all , Monseigneur . He is dead . Well ! He is quiet . Can I restore him to you ? Alas , no , Monseigneur ! But he lies yonder , under a little heap of poor grass . 
 Well ? Monseigneur , there are so many little heaps of poor grass ? Again , well ? She looked an old woman , but was young . Her manner was one of passionate grief ; by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together with wild energy , and laid one of them on the carriage-doortenderly , caressingly , as if it had been a human breast , and could be expected to feel the appealing touch . Monseigneur , hear me ! Monseigneur , hear my petition ! My husband died of want ; so many die of want ; so many more will die of want . 
 Again , well ? Can I feed them ? Monseigneur , the good God knows ; but I don't ask it . My petition is , that a morsel of stone or wood , with my husband's name , may be placed over him to show where he lies . Otherwise , the place will be quickly forgotten , it will never be found when I am dead of the same malady , I shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass . Monseigneur , they are so many , they increase so fast , there is so much want . Monseigneur ! Monseigneur ! 
 The sweet scents of the summer night rose all around him , and rose , as the rain falls , impartially , on the dusty , ragged , and toil-worn group at the fountain not far away ; to whom the mender of roads , with the aid of the blue cap without which he was nothing , still enlarged upon his man like a spectre , as long as they could bear it . By degrees , as they could bear no more , they dropped off one by one , and lights twinkled in little casements ; which lights , as the casements darkened , and more stars came out , seemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having been extinguished . 
 It was a heavy mass of building , that chateau of Monsieur the Marquis , with a large stone courtyard before it , and two stone sweeps of staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door . A stony business altogether , with heavy stone balustrades , and stone urns , and stone flowers , and stone faces of men , and stone heads of lions , in all directions . As if the Gorgon's head had surveyed it , when it was finished , two centuries ago . 
 Up the broad flight of shallow steps , Monsieur the Marquis , flambeau preceded , went from his carriage , sufficiently disturbing the darkness to elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile of stable building away among the trees . All else was so quiet , that the flambeau carried up the steps , and the other flambeau held at the great door , burnt as if they were in a close room of state , instead of being in the open night-air . Other sound than the owl's voice there was none , save the failing of a fountain into its stone basin ; for , it was one of those dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together , and then heave a long low sigh , and hold their breath again . 
 Avoiding the larger rooms , which were dark and made fast for the night , Monsieur the Marquis , with his flambeau-bearer going on before , went up the staircase to a door in a corridor . This thrown open , admitted him to his own private apartment of three rooms : his bed-chamber and two others . High vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted floors , great dogs upon the hearths for the burning of wood in winter time , and all luxuries befitting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and country . The fashion of the last Louis but one , of the line that was never to breakthe fourteenth Louiswas conspicuous in their rich furniture ; but , it was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old pages in the history of France . 
 A supper-table was laid for two , in the third of the rooms ; a round room , in one of the chateau's four extinguisher-topped towers . A small lofty room , with its window wide open , and the wooden jalousie-blinds closed , so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of black , alternating with their broad lines of stone colour . My nephew , said the Marquis , glancing at the supper preparation ; they said he was not arrived . Nor was he ; but , he had been expected with Monseigneur . 
 Ah ! It is not probable he will arrive to-night ; nevertheless , leave the table as it is . I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour . In a quarter of an hour Monseigneur was ready , and sat down alone to his sumptuous and choice supper . His chair was opposite to the window , and he had taken his soup , and was raising his glass of Bordeaux to his lips , when he put it down . What is that ? he calmly asked , looking with attention at the horizontal lines of black and stone colour . 
 Monseigneur ? That ? Outside the blinds . Open the blinds . It was done . Well ? Monseigneur , it is nothing . The trees and the night are all that are here . The servant who spoke , had thrown the blinds wide , had looked out into the vacant darkness , and stood with that blank behind him , looking round for instructions . Good , said the imperturbable master . Close them again . That was done too , and the Marquis went on with his supper . He was half way through it , when he again stopped with his glass in his hand , hearing the sound of wheels . It came on briskly , and came up to the front of the chateau . 
 Ask who is arrived . It was the nephew of Monseigneur . He had been some few leagues behind Monseigneur , early in the afternoon . He had diminished the distance rapidly , but not so rapidly as to come up with Monseigneur on the road . He had heard of Monseigneur , at the posting-houses , as being before him . He was to be told (said Monseigneur) that supper awaited him then and there , and that he was prayed to come to it . In a little while he came . He had been known in England as Charles Darnay . 
 Monseigneur received him in a courtly manner , but they did not shake hands . You left Paris yesterday , sir ? he said to Monseigneur , as he took his seat at table . Yesterday . And you ? I come direct . From London ? Yes . You have been a long time coming , said the Marquis , with a smile . On the contrary ; I come direct . Pardon me ! I mean , not a long time on the journey ; a long time intending the journey . I have been detained bythe nephew stopped a moment in his answervarious business . Without doubt , said the polished uncle . 
 So long as a servant was present , no other words passed between them . When coffee had been served and they were alone together , the nephew , looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a fine mask , opened a conversation . I have come back , sir , as you anticipate , pursuing the object that took me away . It carried me into great and unexpected peril ; but it is a sacred object , and if it had carried me to death I hope it would have sustained me . Not to death , said the uncle ; it is not necessary to say , to death . 
 I doubt , sir , returned the nephew , whether , if it had carried me to the utmost brink of death , you would have cared to stop me there . The deepened marks in the nose , and the lengthening of the fine straight lines in the cruel face , looked ominous as to that ; the uncle made a graceful gesture of protest , which was so clearly a slight form of good breeding that it was not reassuring . Indeed , sir , pursued the nephew , for anything I know , you may have expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious circumstances that surrounded me . 
 No , no , no , said the uncle , pleasantly . But , however that may be , resumed the nephew , glancing at him with deep distrust , I know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means , and would know no scruple as to means . My friend , I told you so , said the uncle , with a fine pulsation in the two marks . Do me the favour to recall that I told you so , long ago . I recall it . Thank you , said the Marquisevery sweetly indeed . His tone lingered in the air , almost like the tone of a musical instrument . 
 In effect , sir , pursued the nephew , I believe it to be at once your bad fortune , and my good fortune , that has kept me out of a prison in France here . I do not quite understand , returned the uncle , sipping his coffee . Dare I ask you to explain ? I believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court , and had not been overshadowed by that cloud for years past , a letter de cachet would have sent me to some fortress indefinitely . It is possible , said the uncle , with great calmness . For the honour of the family , I could even resolve to incommode you to that extent . Pray excuse me ! I perceive that , happily for me , the Reception of the day before yesterday was , as usual , a cold one , observed the nephew . 
 I would not say happily , my friend , returned the uncle , with refined politeness ; I would not be sure of that . A good opportunity for consideration , surrounded by the advantages of solitude , might influence your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for yourself . But it is useless to discuss the question . I am , as you say , at a disadvantage . These little instruments of correction , these gentle aids to the power and honour of families , these slight favours that might so incommode you , are only to be obtained now by interest and importunity . 
 They are sought by so many , and they are granted (comparatively) to so few ! It used not to be so , but France in all such things is changed for the worse . Our not remote ancestors held the right of life and death over the surrounding vulgar . From this room , many such dogs have been taken out to be hanged ; in the next room (my bedroom) , one fellow , to our knowledge , was poniarded on the spot for professing some insolent delicacy respecting his daughterhis daughter ? We have lost many privileges ; a new philosophy has become the mode ; and the assertion of our station , in these days , might (I do not go so far as to say would , but might) cause us real inconvenience . All very bad , very bad ! 
 The Marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff , and shook his head ; as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still containing himself , that great means of regeneration . We have so asserted our station , both in the old time and in the modern time also , said the nephew , gloomily , that I believe our name to be more detested than any name in France . Let us hope so , said the uncle . Detestation of the high is the involuntary homage of the low . 
 There is not , pursued the nephew , in his former tone , a face I can look at , in all this country round about us , which looks at me with any deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery . A compliment , said the Marquis , to the grandeur of the family , merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur . Hah ! And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff , and lightly crossed his legs . But , when his nephew , leaning an elbow on the table , covered his eyes thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand , the fine mask looked at him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness , closeness , and dislike , than was comportable with its wearer's assumption of indifference . 
 Repression is the only lasting philosophy . The dark deference of fear and slavery , my friend , observed the Marquis , will keep the dogs obedient to the whip , as long as this roof , looking up to it , shuts out the sky . That might not be so long as the Marquis supposed . If a picture of the chateau as it was to be a very few years hence , and of fifty like it as they too were to be a very few years hence , could have been shown to him that night , he might have been at a loss to claim his own from the ghastly , fire-charred , plunder-wrecked rains . As for the roof he vaunted , he might have found THAT shutting out the sky in a new wayto wit , for ever , from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead was fired , out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets . 
 Meanwhile , said the Marquis , I will preserve the honour and repose of the family , if you will not . But you must be fatigued . Shall we terminate our conference for the night ? A moment more . An hour , if you please . Sir , said the nephew , we have done wrong , and are reaping the fruits of wrong . WE have done wrong ? repeated the Marquis , with an inquiring smile , and delicately pointing , first to his nephew , then to himself . 
 Our family ; our honourable family , whose honour is of so much account to both of us , in such different ways . Even in my father's time , we did a world of wrong , injuring every human creature who came between us and our pleasure , whatever it was . Why need I speak of my father's time , when it is equally yours ? Can I separate my father's twin-brother , joint inheritor , and next successor , from himself ? Death has done that ! said the Marquis . 
 And has left me , answered the nephew , bound to a system that is frightful to me , responsible for it , but powerless in it ; seeking to execute the last request of my dear mother's lips , and obey the last look of my dear mother's eyes , which implored me to have mercy and to redress ; and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain . Seeking them from me , my nephew , said the Marquis , touching him on the breast with his forefingerthey were now standing by the hearthyou will for ever seek them in vain , be assured . 
 Every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face , was cruelly , craftily , and closely compressed , while he stood looking quietly at his nephew , with his snuff-box in his hand . Once again he touched him on the breast , as though his finger were the fine point of a small sword , with which , in delicate finesse , he ran him through the body , and said , My friend , I will die , perpetuating the system under which I have lived . 
 When he had said it , he took a culminating pinch of snuff , and put his box in his pocket . Better to be a rational creature , he added then , after ringing a small bell on the table , and accept your natural destiny . But you are lost , Monsieur Charles , I see . This property and France are lost to me , said the nephew , sadly ; I renounce them . Are they both yours to renounce ? France may be , but is the property ? It is scarcely worth mentioning ; but , is it yet ? I had no intention , in the words I used , to claim it yet . If it passed to me from you , to-morrow
 Which I have the vanity to hope is not probable . or twenty years henceYou do me too much honour , said the Marquis ; still , I prefer that supposition . I would abandon it , and live otherwise and elsewhere . It is little to relinquish . What is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin ! Hah ! said the Marquis , glancing round the luxurious room . To the eye it is fair enough , here ; but seen in its integrity , under the sky , and by the daylight , it is a crumbling tower of waste , mismanagement , extortion , debt , mortgage , oppression , hunger , nakedness , and suffering . 
 Hah ! said the Marquis again , in a well-satisfied manner . If it ever becomes mine , it shall be put into some hands better qualified to free it slowly (if such a thing is possible) from the weight that drags it down , so that the miserable people who cannot leave it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance , may , in another generation , suffer less ; but it is not for me . There is a curse on it , and on all this land . 
 And you ? said the uncle . Forgive my curiosity ; do you , under your new philosophy , graciously intend to live ? I must do , to live , what others of my countrymen , even with nobility at their backs , may have to do some daywork . In England , for example ? Yes . The family honour , sir , is safe from me in this country . The family name can suffer from me in no other , for I bear it in no other . The ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed-chamber to be lighted . It now shone brightly , through the door of communication . The Marquis looked that way , and listened for the retreating step of his valet . 
 England is very attractive to you , seeing how indifferently you have prospered there , he observed then , turning his calm face to his nephew with a smile . I have already said , that for my prospering there , I am sensible I may be indebted to you , sir . For the rest , it is my Refuge . They say , those boastful English , that it is the Refuge of many . You know a compatriot who has found a Refuge there ? A Doctor ? Yes . With a daughter ? Yes . Yes , said the Marquis . You are fatigued . Good night ! 
 As he bent his head in his most courtly manner , there was a secrecy in his smiling face , and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words , which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly . At the same time , the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes , and the thin straight lips , and the markings in the nose , curved with a sarcasm that looked handsomely diabolic . Yes , repeated the Marquis . A Doctor with a daughter . Yes . So commences the new philosophy ! You are fatigued . Good night ! 
 It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his . The nephew looked at him , in vain , in passing on to the door . Good night ! said the uncle . I look to the pleasure of seeing you again in the morning . Good repose ! Light Monsieur my nephew to his chamber there ! And burn Monsieur my nephew in his bed , if you will , he added to himself , before he rang his little bell again , and summoned his valet to his own bedroom . 
 The valet come and gone , Monsieur the Marquis walked to and fro in his loose chamber-robe , to prepare himself gently for sleep , that hot still night . Rustling about the room , his softly-slippered feet making no noise on the floor , he moved like a refined tiger : looked like some enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort , in story , whose periodical change into tiger form was either just going off , or just coming on . 
 He moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom , looking again at the scraps of the day's journey that came unbidden into his mind ; the slow toil up the hill at sunset , the setting sun , the descent , the mill , the prison on the crag , the little village in the hollow , the peasants at the fountain , and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the chain under the carriage . That fountain suggested the Paris fountain , the little bundle lying on the step , the women bending over it , and the tall man with his arms up , crying , Dead ! 
 I am cool now , said Monsieur the Marquis , and may go to bed . So , leaving only one light burning on the large hearth , he let his thin gauze curtains fall around him , and heard the night break its silence with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep . The stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night for three heavy hours ; for three heavy hours , the horses in the stables rattled at their racks , the dogs barked , and the owl made a noise with very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to the owl by men-poets . But it is the obstinate custom of such creatures hardly ever to say what is set down for them . 
 For three heavy hours , the stone faces of the chateau , lion and human , stared blindly at the night . Dead darkness lay on all the landscape , dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads . The burial-place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass were undistinguishable from one another ; the figure on the Cross might have come down , for anything that could be seen of it . In the village , taxers and taxed were fast asleep . Dreaming , perhaps , of banquets , as the starved usually do , and of ease and rest , as the driven slave and the yoked ox may , its lean inhabitants slept soundly , and were fed and freed . 
 Lighter and lighter , until at last the sun touched the tops of the still trees , and poured its radiance over the hill . In the glow , the water of the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood , and the stone faces crimsoned . The carol of the birds was loud and high , and , on the weather-beaten sill of the great window of the bed-chamber of Monsieur the Marquis , one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might . At this , the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed , and , with open mouth and dropped under-jaw , looked awe-stricken . 
 Now , the sun was full up , and movement began in the village . Casement windows opened , crazy doors were unbarred , and people came forth shiveringchilled , as yet , by the new sweet air . Then began the rarely lightened toil of the day among the village population . Some , to the fountain ; some , to the fields ; men and women here , to dig and delve ; men and women there , to see to the poor live stock , and lead the bony cows out , to such pasture as could be found by the roadside . In the church and at the Cross , a kneeling figure or two ; attendant on the latter prayers , the led cow , trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its foot . 
 The chateau awoke later , as became its quality , but awoke gradually and surely . First , the lonely boar-spears and knives of the chase had been reddened as of old ; then , had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine ; now , doors and windows were thrown open , horses in their stables looked round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at doorways , leaves sparkled and rustled at iron-grated windows , dogs pulled hard at their chains , and reared impatient to be loosed . 
 What winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads , already at work on the hill-top beyond the village , with his day's dinner (not much to carry) lying in a bundle that it was worth no crow's while to peck at , on a heap of stones ? Had the birds , carrying some grains of it to a distance , dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds ? Whether or no , the mender of roads ran , on the sultry morning , as if for his life , down the hill , knee-high in dust , and never stopped till he got to the fountain . 
 All the people of the village were at the fountain , standing about in their depressed manner , and whispering low , but showing no other emotions than grim curiosity and surprise . The led cows , hastily brought in and tethered to anything that would hold them , were looking stupidly on , or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their trouble , which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter . Some of the people of the chateau , and some of those of the posting-house , and all the taxing authorities , were armed more or less , and were crowded on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way , that was highly fraught with nothing . 
 Already , the mender of roads had penetrated into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends , and was smiting himself in the breast with his blue cap . What did all this portend , and what portended the swift hoisting-up of Monsieur Gabelle behind a servant on horseback , and the conveying away of the said Gabelle (double-laden though the horse was) , at a gallop , like a new version of the German ballad of Leonora ? It portended that there was one stone face too many , up at the chateau . 
 The Gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night , and had added the one stone face wanting ; the stone face for which it had waited through about two hundred years . It lay back on the pillow of Monsieur the Marquis . It was like a fine mask , suddenly startled , made angry , and petrified . Driven home into the heart of the stone figure attached to it , was a knife . Round its hilt was a frill of paper , on which was scrawled : Drive him fast to his tomb . This , from Jacques . 
 More months , to the number of twelve , had come and gone , and Mr . Charles Darnay was established in England as a higher teacher of the French language who was conversant with French literature . In this age , he would have been a Professor ; in that age , he was a Tutor . He read with young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a living tongue spoken all over the world , and he cultivated a taste for its stores of knowledge and fancy . He could write of them , besides , in sound English , and render them into sound English . 
 Such masters were not at that time easily found ; Princes that had been , and Kings that were to be , were not yet of the Teacher class , and no ruined nobility had dropped out of Tellson's ledgers , to turn cooks and carpenters . As a tutor , whose attainments made the student's way unusually pleasant and profitable , and as an elegant translator who brought something to his work besides mere dictionary knowledge , young Mr . Darnay soon became known and encouraged . He was well acquainted , more-over , with the circumstances of his country , and those were of ever-growing interest . So , with great perseverance and untiring industry , he prospered . 
 In London , he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold , nor to lie on beds of roses ; if he had had any such exalted expectation , he would not have prospered . He had expected labour , and he found it , and did it and made the best of it . In this , his prosperity consisted . A certain portion of his time was passed at Cambridge , where he read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a contraband trade in European languages , instead of conveying Greek and Latin through the Custom-house . The rest of his time he passed in London . 
 He had loved Lucie Manette from the hour of his danger . He had never heard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her compassionate voice ; he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful , as hers when it was confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been dug for him . But , he had not yet spoken to her on the subject ; the assassination at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long , long , dusty roadsthe solid stone chateau which had itself become the mere mist of a dreamhad been done a year , and he had never yet , by so much as a single spoken word , disclosed to her the state of his heart . 
 He found the Doctor reading in his arm-chair at a window . The energy which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated their sharpness , had been gradually restored to him . He was now a very energetic man indeed , with great firmness of purpose , strength of resolution , and vigour of action . In his recovered energy he was sometimes a little fitful and sudden , as he had at first been in the exercise of his other recovered faculties ; but , this had never been frequently observable , and had grown more and more rare . 
 He studied much , slept little , sustained a great deal of fatigue with ease , and was equably cheerful . To him , now entered Charles Darnay , at sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand . Charles Darnay ! I rejoice to see you . We have been counting on your return these three or four days past . Mr . Stryver and Sydney Carton were both here yesterday , and both made you out to be more than due . I am obliged to them for their interest in the matter , he answered , a little coldly as to them , though very warmly as to the Doctor . Miss Manette
 Is well , said the Doctor , as he stopped short , and your return will delight us all . She has gone out on some household matters , but will soon be home . Doctor Manette , I knew she was from home . I took the opportunity of her being from home , to beg to speak to you . There was a blank silence . Yes ? said the Doctor , with evident constraint . Bring your chair here , and speak on . He complied as to the chair , but appeared to find the speaking on less easy . 
 I have had the happiness , Doctor Manette , of being so intimate here , so he at length began , for some year and a half , that I hope the topic on which I am about to touch may notHe was stayed by the Doctor's putting out his hand to stop him . When he had kept it so a little while , he said , drawing it back : Is Lucie the topic ? She is . It is hard for me to speak of her at any time . It is very hard for me to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours , Charles Darnay . It is a tone of fervent admiration , true homage , and deep love , Doctor Manette ! he said deferentially . 
 There was another blank silence before her father rejoined : I believe it . I do you justice ; I believe it . His constraint was so manifest , and it was so manifest , too , that it originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject , that Charles Darnay hesitated . Shall I go on , sir ? Another blank . Yes , go on . You anticipate what I would say , though you cannot know how earnestly I say it , how earnestly I feel it , without knowing my secret heart , and the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been laden . Dear Doctor Manette , I love your daughter fondly , dearly , disinterestedly , devotedly . If ever there were love in the world , I love her . You have loved yourself ; let your old love speak for me ! 
 The Doctor sat with his face turned away , and his eyes bent on the ground . At the last words , he stretched out his hand again , hurriedly , and cried : Not that , sir ! Let that be ! I adjure you , do not recall that ! His cry was so like a cry of actual pain , that it rang in Charles Darnay's ears long after he had ceased . He motioned with the hand he had extended , and it seemed to be an appeal to Darnay to pause . The latter so received it , and remained silent .
