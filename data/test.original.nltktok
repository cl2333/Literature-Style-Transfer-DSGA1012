But I thinkI knowhe does .
 If you know it , it is enough .
 What would you have me do , my Life .
 It is a painful reflection to me , said Charles Darnay , quite astounded , that I should have done him any wrong .
 I never thought this of him .
 She looked so beautiful in the purity of her faith in this lost man , that her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours .
 The supplication touched him home .
 I will always remember it , dear Heart .
 I will remember it as long as I live .
 At first , there were times , though she was a perfectly happy young wife , when her work would slowly fall from her hands , and her eyes would be dimmed .
 For , there was something coming in the echoes , something light , afar off , and scarcely audible yet , that stirred her heart too much .
 Fluttering hopes and doubtshopes , of a love as yet unknown to her : doubts , of her remaining upon earth , to enjoy that new delightdivided her breast .
 Among the echoes then , there would arise the sound of footsteps at her own early grave .
 and thoughts of the husband who would be left so desolate , and who would mourn for her so much , swelled to her eyes , and broke like waves .
 Ever busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together , weaving the service of her happy influence through the tissue of all their lives , and making it predominate nowhere , Lucie heard in the echoes of years none but friendly and soothing sounds .
 Her husband's step was strong and prosperous among them .
 her father's firm and equal .
 Lo , Miss Pross , in harness of string , awakening the echoes , as an unruly charger , whip-corrected , snorting and pawing the earth under the plane-tree in the garden .
 MrStryver shouldered his way through the law , like some great engine forcing itself through turbid water , and dragged his useful friend in his wake , like a boat towed astern .
 As the boat so favoured is usually in a rough plight , and mostly under water , so , Sydney had a swamped life of it .
 But , easy and strong custom , unhappily so much easier and stronger in him than any stimulating sense of desert or disgrace , made it the life he was to lead .
 and he no more thought of emerging from his state of lion's jackal , than any real jackal may be supposed to think of rising to be a lion .
 Stryver was rich .
 had married a florid widow with property and three boys , who had nothing particularly shining about them but the straight hair of their dumpling heads .
 But , there were other echoes , from a distance , that rumbled menacingly in the corner all through this space of time .
 And it was now , about little Lucie's sixth birthday , that they began to have an awful sound , as of a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising .
 On a night in mid-July , one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine , MrLorry came in late , from Tellson's , and sat himself down by Lucie and her husband in the dark window .
 It was a hot , wild night , and they were all three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked at the lightning from the same place .
 I began to think , said MrLorry , pushing his brown wig back , that I should have to pass the night at Tellson's .
 We have been so full of business all day , that we have not known what to do first , or which way to turn .
 There is such an uneasiness in Paris , that we have actually a run of confidence upon us .
 Our customers over there , seem not to be able to confide their property to us fast enough .
 There is positively a mania among some of them for sending it to England .
 A bad look , you say , my dear Darnay .
 Yes , but we don't know what reason there is in it .
 People are so unreasonable .
 Some of us at Tellson's are getting old , and we really can't be troubled out of the ordinary course without due occasion .
 Still , said Darnay , you know how gloomy and threatening the sky is .
 Here he is , said the Doctor , entering the dark room at the moment .
 I am quite glad you are at home .
 for these hurries and forebodings by which I have been surrounded all day long , have made me nervous without reason .
 You are not going out , I hope .
 No .
 I am going to play backgammon with you , if you like , said the Doctor .
 I don't think I do like , if I may speak my mind .
 I am not fit to be pitted against you to-night .
 Is the teaboard still there , Lucie .
 I can't see .
 Thank ye , my dear .
 The precious child is safe in bed .
 And sleeping soundly .
 Not a theory .
 it was a fancy .
 A fancy , then , my wise pet , said MrLorry , patting her hand .
 They are very numerous and very loud , though , are they not .
 Only hear them .
 Keep near to me , Jacques Three , cried Defarge .
 and do you , Jacques One and Two , separate and put yourselves at the head of as many of these patriots as you can .
 Where is my wife .
 Eh , well .
 Here you see me .
 said madame , composed as ever , but not knitting to-day .
 Madame's resolute right hand was occupied with an axe , in place of the usual softer implements , and in her girdle were a pistol and a cruel knife .
 Where do you go , my wife .
 I go , said madame , with you at present .
 You shall see me at the head of women , by-and-bye .
 Come , then .
 cried Defarge , in a resounding voice .
 Patriots and friends , we are ready .
 The Bastille .
 With a roar that sounded as if all the breath in France had been shaped into the detested word , the living sea rose , wave on wave , depth on depth , and overflowed the city to that point .
 Alarm-bells ringing , drums beating , the sea raging and thundering on its new beach , the attack began .
 Deep ditch , single drawbridge , massive stone walls , eight great towers , cannon , muskets , fire and smoke .
 One drawbridge down .
 Work , comrades all , work .
 Work , Jacques One , Jacques Two , Jacques One Thousand , Jacques Two Thousand , Jacques Five-and-Twenty Thousand .
 in the name of all the Angels or the Devilswhich you preferwork .
 Thus Defarge of the wine-shop , still at his gun , which had long grown hot .
 So resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him on , that even to draw his breath or turn his head was as impracticable as if he had been struggling in the surf at the South Sea , until he was landed in the outer courtyard of the Bastille .
 There , against an angle of a wall , he made a struggle to look about him .
 Jacques Three was nearly at his side .
 Madame Defarge , still heading some of her women , was visible in the inner distance , and her knife was in her hand .
 Everywhere was tumult , exultation , deafening and maniacal bewilderment , astounding noise , yet furious dumb-show .
 The Prisoners .
 The Records .
 The secret cells .
 The instruments of torture .
 The Prisoners .
 Show me the North Tower .
 said Defarge .
 Quick .
 I will faithfully , replied the man , if you will come with me .
 But there is no one there .
 What is the meaning of One Hundred and Five , North Tower .
 asked Defarge .
 Quick .
 The meaning , monsieur .
 Does it mean a captive , or a place of captivity .
 Or do you mean that I shall strike you dead .
 Kill him .
 croaked Jacques Three , who had come close up .
 Monsieur , it is a cell .
 Show it me .
 Pass this way , then .
 Jacques Three , with his usual craving on him , and evidently disappointed by the dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to promise bloodshed , held by Defarge's arm as he held by the turnkey's .
 Their three heads had been close together during this brief discourse , and it had been as much as they could do to hear one another , even then : so tremendous was the noise of the living ocean , in its irruption into the Fortress , and its inundation of the courts and passages and staircases .
 All around outside , too , it beat the walls with a deep , hoarse roar , from which , occasionally , some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped into the air like spray .
 One hundred and five , North Tower .
 Pass that torch slowly along these walls , that I may see them , said Defarge to the turnkey .
 The man obeyed , and Defarge followed the light closely with his eyes .
 Stop .
 Look here , Jacques .
 croaked Jacques Three , as he read greedily .
 He had still the linstock of his gun in his own hand .
 He made a sudden exchange of the two instruments , and turning on the worm-eaten stool and table , beat them to pieces in a few blows .
 Nothing in the wood , and nothing in the straw , Jacques .
 Nothing .
 Let us collect them together , in the middle of the cell .
 So .
 Light them , you .
 The turnkey fired the little pile , which blazed high and hot .
 Stooping again to come out at the low-arched door , they left it burning , and retraced their way to the courtyard .
 seeming to recover their sense of hearing as they came down , until they were in the raging flood once more .
 They found it surging and tossing , in quest of Defarge himself .
 Saint Antoine was clamorous to have its wine-shop keeper foremost in the guard upon the governor who had defended the Bastille and shot the people .
 Otherwise , the governor would not be marched to the Hotel de Ville for judgment .
 Otherwise , the governor would escape , and the people's blood suddenly of some value , after many years of worthlessness be unavenged .
 The sea of black and threatening waters , and of destructive upheaving of wave against wave , whose depths were yet unfathomed and whose forces were yet unknown .
 The remorseless sea of turbulently swaying shapes , voices of vengeance , and faces hardened in the furnaces of suffering until the touch of pity could make no mark on them .
 Haggard Saint Antoine had had only one exultant week , in which to soften his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could , with the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations , when Madame Defarge sat at her counter , as usual , presiding over the customers .
 Madame Defarge wore no rose in her head , for the great brotherhood of Spies had become , even in one short week , extremely chary of trusting themselves to the saint's mercies .
 The lamps across his streets had a portentously elastic swing with them .
 Madame Defarge , with her arms folded , sat in the morning light and heat , contemplating the wine-shop and the street .
 In both , there were several knots of loungers , squalid and miserable , but now with a manifest sense of power enthroned on their distress .
 The raggedest nightcap , awry on the wretchedest head , had this crooked significance in it : I know how hard it has grown for me , the wearer of this , to support life in myself .
 but do you know how easy it has grown for me , the wearer of this , to destroy life in you .
 Every lean bare arm , that had been without work before , had this work always ready for it now , that it could strike .
 The fingers of the knitting women were vicious , with the experience that they could tear .
 There was a change in the appearance of Saint Antoine .
 the image had been hammering into this for hundreds of years , and the last finishing blows had told mightily on the expression .
 As if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of Saint Antoine Quarter to the wine-shop door , had been suddenly fired , a fast-spreading murmur came rushing along .
 It is Defarge , said madame .
 Silence , patriots .
 Defarge came in breathless , pulled off a red cap he wore , and looked around him .
 Listen , everywhere .
 said madame again .
 Listen to him .
 Defarge stood , panting , against a background of eager eyes and open mouths , formed outside the door .
 all those within the wine-shop had sprung to their feet .
 News from the other world .
 How , then .
 cried madame , contemptuously .
 The other world .
 Does everybody here recall old Foulon , who told the famished people that they might eat grass , and who died , and went to Hell .
 Everybody .
 from all throats .
 The news is of him .
 He is among us .
 Among us .
 from the universal throat again .
 And dead .
 Wretched old sinner of more than threescore years and ten , if he had never known it yet , he would have known it in his heart of hearts if he could have heard the answering cry .
 A moment of profound silence followed .
 Defarge and his wife looked steadfastly at one another .
 The Vengeance stooped , and the jar of a drum was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter .
 Instantly Madame Defarge's knife was in her girdle .
 the drum was beating in the streets , as if it and a drummer had flown together by magic .
 and The Vengeance , uttering terrific shrieks , and flinging her arms about her head like all the forty Furies at once , was tearing from house to house , rousing the women .
 Nevertheless , not a moment was lost .
 not a moment .
 This Foulon was at the Hotel de Ville , and might be loosed .
 Never , if Saint Antoine knew his own sufferings , insults , and wrongs .
 Armed men and women flocked out of the Quarter so fast , and drew even these last dregs after them with such a force of suction , that within a quarter of an hour there was not a human creature in Saint Antoine's bosom but a few old crones and the wailing children .
 No .
 They were all by that time choking the Hall of Examination where this old man , ugly and wicked , was , and overflowing into the adjacent open space and streets .
 The Defarges , husband and wife , The Vengeance , and Jacques Three , were in the first press , and at no great distance from him in the Hall .
 See .
 cried madame , pointing with her knife .
 See the old villain bound with ropes .
 That was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon his back .
 Ha , ha .
 That was well done .
 Let him eat it now .
 Madame put her knife under her arm , and clapped her hands as at a play .
 Not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children , wailing and breadless .
 Then , the miserable bakers' shops were beset by long files of them , patiently waiting to buy bad bread .
 and while they waited with stomachs faint and empty , they beguiled the time by embracing one another on the triumphs of the day , and achieving them again in gossip .
 Gradually , these strings of ragged people shortened and frayed away .
 and then poor lights began to shine in high windows , and slender fires were made in the streets , at which neighbours cooked in common , afterwards supping at their doors .
 At last it is come , my dear .
 But , this was not the change on the village , and on many a village like it .
 For scores of years gone by , Monseigneur had squeezed it and wrung it , and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures of the chasenow , found in hunting the people .
 now , found in hunting the beasts , for whose preservation Monseigneur made edifying spaces of barbarous and barren wilderness .
 No .
 The change consisted in the appearance of strange faces of low caste , rather than in the disappearance of the high caste , chiselled , and otherwise beautified and beautifying features of Monseigneur .
 The man looked at him , looked at the village in the hollow , at the mill , and at the prison on the crag .
 When he had identified these objects in what benighted mind he had , he said , in a dialect that was just intelligible : 
 How goes it , Jacques .
 All well , Jacques .
 Touch then .
 They joined hands , and the man sat down on the heap of stones .
 No dinner .
 Nothing but supper now , said the mender of roads , with a hungry face .
 It is the fashion , growled the man .
 I meet no dinner anywhere .
 Touch then .
 It was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this time , after observing these operations .
 They again joined hands .
 To-night .
 said the mender of roads .
 To-night , said the man , putting the pipe in his mouth .
 Where .
 Here .
 Show me .
 said the traveller then , moving to the brow of the hill .
 See .
 returned the mender of roads , with extended finger .
 You go down here , and straight through the street , and past the fountain
.
 To the Devil with all that .
 interrupted the other , rolling his eye over the landscape .
 I go through no streets and past no fountains .
 Well .
 Good .
 When do you cease to work .
 At sunset .
 Will you wake me , before departing .
 I have walked two nights without resting .
 Let me finish my pipe , and I shall sleep like a child .
 Will you wake me .
 Surely .
 Good .
 said the sleeper , rising on his elbow .
 Two leagues beyond the summit of the hill .
 The rider from the chateau , and the horse in a foam , clattered away through the village , and galloped up the stony steep , to the prison on the crag .
 At the gate , a group of officers were looking at the fire .
 removed from them , a group of soldiers .
 Help , gentlemenofficers .
 The chateau is on fire .
 valuable objects may be saved from the flames by timely aid .
 Help , help .
 The officers looked towards the soldiers who looked at the fire .
 gave no orders .
 and answered , with shrugs and biting of lips , It must burn .
 Within a hundred miles , and in the light of other fires , there were other functionaries less fortunate , that night and other nights , whom the rising sun found hanging across once-peaceful streets , where they had been born and bred .
 also , there were other villagers and townspeople less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows , upon whom the functionaries and soldiery turned with success , and whom they strung up in their turn .
 But , the fierce figures were steadily wending East , West , North , and South , be that as it would .
 and whosoever hung , fire burned .
 The altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it , no functionary , by any stretch of mathematics , was able to calculate successfully .
 In such risings of fire and risings of seathe firm earth shaken by the rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb , but was always on the flow , higher and higher , to the terror and wonder of the beholders on the shorethree years of tempest were consumed .
 Three more birthdays of little Lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful tissue of the life of her home .
 The August of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two was come , and Monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide .
 But , although you are the youngest man that ever lived , said Charles Darnay , rather hesitating , I must still suggest to you .
 I understand .
 That I am too old .
 said MrLorry .
 Unsettled weather , a long journey , uncertain means of travelling , a disorganised country , a city that may not be even safe for you .
 Indeed .
 You are a pretty fellow to object and advise .
 exclaimed MrLorry .
 You wish you were going yourself .
 And you a Frenchman born .
 You are a wise counsellor .
 When you were talking to Lucie , MrLorry repeated .
 Yes .
 I wonder you are not ashamed to mention the name of Lucie .
 Wishing you were going to France at this time of day .
 However , I am not going , said Charles Darnay , with a smile .
 It is more to the purpose that you say you are .
 How I admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit , MrLorry .
 Tut .
 Nonsense , sir .
 And , my dear Charles , said MrLorry , glancing at the House again , you are to remember , that getting things out of Paris at this present time , no matter what things , is next to an impossibility .
 Papers and precious matters were this very day brought to us here I speak in strict confidence .
 it is not business-like to whisper it , even to you , by the strangest bearers you can imagine , every one of whom had his head hanging on by a single hair as he passed the Barriers .
 At another time , our parcels would come and go , as easily as in business-like Old England .
 but now , everything is stopped .
 And do you really go to-night .
 And do you take no one with you .
 All sorts of people have been proposed to me , but I will have nothing to say to any of them .
 I intend to take Jerry .
 Jerry has been my bodyguard on Sunday nights for a long time past and I am used to him .
 Nobody will suspect Jerry of being anything but an English bull-dog , or of having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his master .
 I must say again that I heartily admire your gallantry and youthfulness .
 I must say again , nonsense , nonsense .
 When I have executed this little commission , I shall , perhaps , accept Tellson's proposal to retire and live at my ease .
 Time enough , then , to think about growing old .
 On the marriage morning , Doctor Manette had made it his one urgent and express request to Charles Darnay , that the secret of this name should beunless he , the Doctor , dissolved the obligationkept inviolate between them .
 Nobody else knew it to be his name .
 his own wife had no suspicion of the fact .
 MrLorry could have none .
 No , said MrLorry , in reply to the House .
 I have referred it , I think , to everybody now here , and no one can tell me where this gentleman is to be found .
 Nephew , I believebut in any case degenerate successorof the polished Marquis who was murdered , said one .
 Happy to say , I never knew him .
 Infected with the new doctrines , said a third , eyeing the direction through his glass in passing .
 set himself in opposition to the last Marquis , abandoned the estates when he inherited them , and left them to the ruffian herd .
 They will recompense him now , I hope , as he deserves .
 Hey .
 cried the blatant Stryver .
 Did he though .
 Is that the sort of fellow .
 Let us look at his infamous name .
 Dn the fellow .
 I know the fellow .
 Do you , by Jupiter .
 said Stryver .
 I am sorry for it .
 Why .
 Why , MrDarnay .
 D'ye hear what he did .
 Don't ask , why , in these times .
 But I do ask why .
 I understand how to put YOU in a corner , MrDarnay , said Bully Stryver , and I'll do it .
 If this fellow is a gentleman , I DON'T understand him .
 You may tell him so , with my compliments .
 You may also tell him , from me , that after abandoning his worldly goods and position to this butcherly mob , I wonder he is not at the head of them .
 But , no , gentlemen , said Stryver , looking all round , and snapping his fingers , I know something of human nature , and I tell you that you'll never find a fellow like this fellow , trusting himself to the mercies of such precious PROTEGES .
 No , gentlemen .
 he'll always show ëem a clean pair of heels very early in the scuffle , and sneak away .
 With those words , and a final snap of his fingers , MrStryver shouldered himself into Fleet-street , amidst the general approbation of his hearers .
 MrLorry and Charles Darnay were left alone at the desk , in the general departure from the Bank .
 Will you take charge of the letter .
 said MrLorry .
 You know where to deliver it .
 I do .
 Will you undertake to explain , that we suppose it to have been addressed here , on the chance of our knowing where to forward it , and that it has been here some time .
 I will do so .
 Do you start for Paris from here .
 From here , at eight .
 I will come back , to see you off .
 MONSIEUR HERETOFORE THE MARQUIS .
 Ah .
 most gracious Monsieur heretofore the Marquis , where is that emigrant .
 I cry in my sleep where is he .
 I demand of Heaven , will he not come to deliver me .
 No answer .
 Ah Monsieur heretofore the Marquis , I send my desolate cry across the sea , hoping it may perhaps reach your ears through the great bank of Tilson known at Paris .
 From this prison here of horror , whence I every hour tend nearer and nearer to destruction , I send you , Monsieur heretofore the Marquis , the assurance of my dolorous and unhappy service .
 Your afflicted .
 Gabelle .
 This favoured the desperate resolution Charles Darnay had begun to make , that he would go to Paris .
 His resolution was made .
 He must go to Paris .
 He walked to and fro , with thoughts very busy , until it was time to return to Tellson's and take leave of MrLorry .
 As soon as he arrived in Paris he would present himself to this old friend , but he must say nothing of his intention now .
 A carriage with post-horses was ready at the Bank door , and Jerry was booted and equipped .
 I have delivered that letter , said Charles Darnay to MrLorry .
 I would not consent to your being charged with any written answer , but perhaps you will take a verbal one .
 That I will , and readily , said MrLorry , if it is not dangerous .
 And what is the message to the unfortunate Gabelle in prison .
 Simply , ëthat he has received the letter , and will come .
 Any time mentioned .
 He will start upon his journey to-morrow night .
 Any person mentioned .
 No .
 That nightit was the fourteenth of Augusthe sat up late , and wrote two fervent letters .
 one was to Lucie , explaining the strong obligation he was under to go to Paris , and showing her , at length , the reasons that he had , for feeling confident that he could become involved in no personal danger there .
 the other was to the Doctor , confiding Lucie and their dear child to his care , and dwelling on the same topics with the strongest assurances .
 To both , he wrote that he would despatch letters in proof of his safety , immediately after his arrival .
 The unseen force was drawing him fast to itself , now , and all the tides and winds were setting straight and strong towards it .
 He left his two letters with a trusty porter , to be delivered half an hour before midnight , and no sooner .
 took horse for Dover .
 and began his journey .
 For the love of Heaven , of justice , of generosity , of the honour of your noble name .
 was the poor prisoner's cry with which he strengthened his sinking heart , as he left all that was dear on earth behind him , and floated away for the Loadstone Rock .
 The end of the second book .
 A very few French leagues of his journey were accomplished , when Charles Darnay began to perceive that for him along these country roads there was no hope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen at Paris .
 Whatever might befall now , he must on to his journey's end .
 Not a mean village closed upon him , not a common barrier dropped across the road behind him , but he knew it to be another iron door in the series that was barred between him and England .
 The universal watchfulness so encompassed him , that if he had been taken in a net , or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage , he could not have felt his freedom more completely gone .
 Nothing but the production of the afflicted Gabelle's letter from his prison of the Abbaye would have got him on so far .
 His difficulty at the guard-house in this small place had been such , that he felt his journey to have come to a crisis .
 And he was , therefore , as little surprised as a man could be , to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he had been remitted until morning , in the middle of the night .
 Emigrant , said the functionary , I am going to send you on to Paris , under an escort .
 Citizen , I desire nothing more than to get to Paris , though I could dispense with the escort .
 Silence .
 growled a red-cap , striking at the coverlet with the butt-end of his musket .
 Peace , aristocrat .
 I have no choice , said Charles Darnay .
 Choice .
 Listen to him .
 cried the same scowling red-cap .
 As if it was not a favour to be protected from the lamp-iron .
 It is always as the good patriot says , observed the functionary .
 Rise and dress yourself , emigrant .
 Emigrant , my friends .
 Do you not see me here , in France , of my own will .
 The postmaster interposed himself between this man and the rider's bridle at which he was evidently making , and soothingly said , Let him be .
 let him be .
 He will be judged at Paris .
 He lies .
 cried the smith .
 He is a traitor since the decree .
 His life is forfeit to the people .
 His cursed life is not his own .
 What is this decree that the smith spoke of .
 Darnay asked the postmaster , when he had thanked him , and stood beside him in the yard .
 Truly , a decree for selling the property of emigrants .
 When passed .
 On the fourteenth .
 The day I left England .
 Everybody says it is but one of several , and that there will be othersif there are not alreadybanishing all emigrants , and condemning all to death who return .
 That is what he meant when he said your life was not your own .
 But there are no such decrees yet .
 Daylight at last found them before the wall of Paris .
 The barrier was closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it .
 Where are the papers of this prisoner .
 demanded a resolute-looking man in authority , who was summoned out by the guard .
 When he had sat in his saddle some half-hour , taking note of these things , Darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority , who directed the guard to open the barrier .
 Then he delivered to the escort , drunk and sober , a receipt for the escorted , and requested him to dismount .
 He did so , and the two patriots , leading his tired horse , turned and rode away without entering the city .
 Citizen Defarge , said he to Darnay's conductor , as he took a slip of paper to write on .
 Is this the emigrant Evremonde .
 This is the man .
 Your age , Evremonde .
 Thirty-seven .
 Married , Evremonde .
 Yes .
 Where married .
 In England .
 Without doubt .
 Where is your wife , Evremonde .
 In England .
 Without doubt .
 You are consigned , Evremonde , to the prison of La Force .
 Just Heaven .
 exclaimed Darnay .
 Under what law , and for what offence .
 The officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment .
 We have new laws , Evremonde , and new offences , since you were here .
 He said it with a hard smile , and went on writing .
 Defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany him .
 The prisoner obeyed , and a guard of two armed patriots attended them .
 Yes , replied Darnay , looking at him with surprise .
 My wife came to your house to reclaim her father .
 Yes .
 The word wife seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to Defarge , to say with sudden impatience , In the name of that sharp female newly-born , and called La Guillotine , why did you come to France .
 You heard me say why , a minute ago .
 Do you not believe it is the truth .
 A bad truth for you , said Defarge , speaking with knitted brows , and looking straight before him .
 Indeed I am lost here .
 All here is so unprecedented , so changed , so sudden and unfair , that I am absolutely lost .
 Will you render me a little help .
 None .
 Defarge spoke , always looking straight before him .
 Will you answer me a single question .
 Perhaps .
 According to its nature .
 You can say what it is .
 In this prison that I am going to so unjustly , shall I have some free communication with the world outside .
 You will see .
 I am not to be buried there , prejudged , and without any means of presenting my case .
 You will see .
 But , what then .
 Other people have been similarly buried in worse prisons , before now .
 But never by me , Citizen Defarge .
 Defarge glanced darkly at him for answer , and walked on in a steady and set silence .
 The deeper he sank into this silence , the fainter hope there wasor so Darnay thoughtof his softening in any slight degree .
 He , therefore , made haste to say : 
 I will do , Defarge doggedly rejoined , nothing for you .
 My duty is to my country and the People .
 I am the sworn servant of both , against you .
 I will do nothing for you .
 Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further , and his pride was touched besides .
 As they walked on in silence , he could not but see how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the streets .
 The very children scarcely noticed him .
 A few passers turned their heads , and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat .
 otherwise , that a man in good clothes should be going to prison , was no more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be going to work .
 In one narrow , dark , and dirty street through which they passed , an excited orator , mounted on a stool , was addressing an excited audience on the crimes against the people , of the king and the royal family .
 The few words that he caught from this man's lips , first made it known to Charles Darnay that the king was in prison , and that the foreign ambassadors had one and all left Paris .
 On the road except at Beauvais he had heard absolutely nothing .
 The escort and the universal watchfulness had completely isolated him .
 That he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had developed themselves when he left England , he of course knew now .
 That perils had thickened about him fast , and might thicken faster and faster yet , he of course knew now .
 He could not but admit to himself that he might not have made this journey , if he could have foreseen the events of a few days .
 And yet his misgivings were not so dark as , imagined by the light of this later time , they would appear .
 Troubled as the future was , it was the unknown future , and in its obscurity there was ignorant hope .
 The horrible massacre , days and nights long , which , within a few rounds of the clock , was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed garnering time of harvest , was as far out of his knowledge as if it had been a hundred thousand years away .
 The sharp female newly-born , and called La Guillotine , was hardly known to him , or to the generality of people , by name .
 The frightful deeds that were to be soon done , were probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers .
 How could they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind .
 What the Devil .
 How many more of them .
 exclaimed the man with the bloated face .
 What the Devil , I say again .
 exclaimed the gaoler , left with his wife .
 How many more .
 In secret , too , grumbled the gaoler , looking at the written paper .
 As if I was not already full to bursting .
 Come .
 said the chief , at length taking up his keys , come with me , emigrant .
 In the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and disgrace , the new-comer recoiled from this company .
 But the crowning unreality of his long unreal ride , was , their all at once rising to receive him , with every refinement of manner known to the time , and with all the engaging graces and courtesies of life .
 So strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and gloom , so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and misery through which they were seen , that Charles Darnay seemed to stand in a company of the dead .
 Ghosts all .
 The ghost of beauty , the ghost of stateliness , the ghost of elegance , the ghost of pride , the ghost of frivolity , the ghost of wit , the ghost of youth , the ghost of age , all waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore , all turning on him eyes that were changed by the death they had died in coming there .
 Charles Darnay roused himself , and gave the required information , in words as suitable as he could find .
 I do not understand the meaning of the term , but I have heard them say so .
 There was a murmur of commiseration as Charles Darnay crossed the room to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him , and many voicesamong which , the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuousgave him good wishes and encouragement .
