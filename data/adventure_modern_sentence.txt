You wouldn’t have heard of me unless you’ve read a book called The Adventures of Tom Sawyer .
 But that’s okay .
 MrMark Twain wrote that book , and what he wrote was mostly true .
 He exaggerated some things , but most of it was true .
 That’s not a big deal .
 I never met anybody who hasn’t lied at one time or another , except for maybe Aunt Polly , the widow , or Mary .
 Aunt Polly—Tom’s Aunt Polly , that is—and Mary and the Widow Douglas are all in that book , which was mostly true , except for some exaggerations , as I said before .
 
.
After supper she got out her Bible and taught me all about Moses and the Bulrusherswater reedsBulrushers .
 I was pretty excited to hear about him , until she told me that he’d been dead a long time .
 After that , I didn’t really care to hear more , since I’m not interested in dead people .
 
.
Now that she had started , Miss Watson went on and on about Heaven .
 She said the only thing people do there is sing and play the harp forever and ever .
 This didn’t sound so great to me .
 I didn’t tell her this , though .
 I asked if she thought Tom Sawyer would go to Heaven , and she said not by a long shot .
 This made me happy , because I wanted the two of us to be together .
 
.
We tiptoed along a path that ran through the trees toward the back of the widow’s garden , hunching over so the branches wouldn’t scrape our heads .
 Just as we passed by the kitchen , I made a noise as I fell over a tree root that was sticking up .
 We crouched down and laid still .
 Miss Watson’s big n----- , Jim , was sitting in the kitchen doorway .
 There was a light behind him , so we could see him pretty clearly .
 He got up , stretched his neck out for a minute to listen .
 
.
Then he said , Who’s that .
 
.
Pretty soon Jim said , Say now , who’s there .
 Where are you .
 I’ll be damned if I didn’t hear something .
 Well , I know what I’m going to do—I’m going to sit down right here and listen until I hear that sound again .
 
.
Some of the boys thought it would be a good idea to also kill the FAMILIES of the boys who told the gang’s secrets .
 Tom liked the idea , so he took a pencil and added it in .
 Then Ben Rogers said : 
.
Well , ain’t he got a father .
  asked Tom Sawyer .
 
.
Yeah , he’s got a father , but nobody knows where to find him these days .
 He used to lay with the hogs in the tanyard when he was drunk , but no one has seen him around here for more than a year .
 
.
Oh , perfect .
 She’ll do .
 Now Huck’s in the gang .
 
.
Then everyone stuck a needle in his finger to draw blood to sign his name , and I made my marksymbol used by people who didn’t know how to write to indicate a signaturemark on the paper .
 
.
Now ,  said Ben Rogers , What’s the main purpose of this gang .
 
.
Nothing , except robbery and murder ,  Tom said .
 
.
Do we always have to kill the people .
 
.
Of course .
 That’s the best way .
 Some experts think differently , but it’s generally considered best to kill them—except for the people you kidnap and bring back to the cave until they’re ransomed .
 
.
Ransomed .
 What’s that .
 
.
But how can we do it if we don’t even know what it is .
 
.
Why , darn it , we’ve GOT to do it .
 Didn’t I say that’s what it says in the books .
 Do you want to do it differently than it’s done in the books and mess it all up .
 
.
Easier said than done , Tom Sawyer .
 What I’m trying to say is how in the world are the people we kidnap going to be ransomed if we don’t even know how to ransom them .
 What do you think it means .
 
.
Well , I don’t know .
 But maybe it means that we keep them til they’re dead .
 
.
Now that makes sense .
 That’ll do .
 Why didn’t you just say that before .
 We’ll keep them until they’re ransomed to death .
 And what a pain they’ll be too , eating everything and always trying to escape .
 
.
Just listen to yourself , Ben Rogers .
 How can they get loose when someone will be guarding them , ready to shoot them down if they move an inch .
 
.
A guard .
 Well , that IS a good idea .
 So someone has got to stay up all night and never get any sleep , just to keep an eye on them .
 I think that’s ridiculous .
 Why can’t we just take a club and ransom them as soon as they get here .
 
.
All right .
 I don’t care .
 But I say it’s foolish anyway .
 Hey , are we going to kill the women , too .
 
.
Well , it’s fine by me if that’s the way it is , but I don’t want any part of it .
 
.
Pretty soon the cave will be so full of women and guys waiting to be ransomed that there won’t be any space left for us robbers .
 But go ahead , I’ve got nothing more to say .
 
.
I climbed back up the shed and crept through my window just before dawn .
 My new clothes were all sticky and smudged with dirt , and I was exhausted .
 
.
Well , old Miss Watson gave me a talking-to in the morning when she saw my dirty clothes , but the widow only scrubbed off the grime without saying a word .
 She looked so sad and disappointed that I decided to try my best to behave for awhile .
 Then Miss Watson took me into the closet to pray for me , but it didn’t make a difference .
 She told me to pray every day , and that I’d get whatever I prayed for if I did .
 But that wasn’t true .
 I tried it .
 Once I got line for my fishing pole , but not any fish hooks .
 What good is a line without hooks .
 I tried praying for hooks three or four times , but I couldn’t make it work .
 One day I asked Miss Watson to try and pray for hooks for me , but she said I was a fool .
 She never told me why , and I never really understood what she meant .
 
.
We played robber every now and then for about a month , but then I quit .
 In fact , all the boys quit because we hadn’t robbed or killed anybody .
 We only pretended .
 We would jump out of the woods and charge at men herding hogs and women taking vegetables to the market , but we never hurt any of them .
 Tom Sawyer called the pigs ingotsgold barsingots ,  and he called the turnips julery ,  and we would go back to the cave and talk about what we’d done and how many people we’d killed and marked .
 But I didn’t see what good any of it did .
 One time Tom sent a boy to run around town with a stick he’d lit on fire as a sign for the Gang to gather .
 When we got together , he told us that he’d gotten secret news from his spies that a whole band of Spanish merchants and wealthy Arabs were coming to town the next day .
 They were going to camp in Cave Hollow with two hundred elephants , six hundred camels , and more than a thousand mules , all loaded down with diamonds , and guarded by four hundred solider .
 We were going to lay in ambuscade—as he called it—and kill them all and then take the loot .
 He said we had to prepare by sharpening our swords and loading our guns .
 He’d never been able to raid a turnip cart before , yet here he was saying we needed to get our swords and guns ready , even though our swords and guns were only wooden lathstrip of wood used as a building materiallaths and broomsticks .
 You could stare at them all you wanted , but in the end that’s all they’d be—laths and broomsticks .
 I didn’t think we could kill such a large band of Spaniards and Arabs , but I wanted to see the camels and elephants , so I joined in the ambuscade the next day , which was a Saturday .
 When we got word , we rushed out of the woods and down the hill .
 But there weren’t any Spaniards and Arabs , and there weren’t any camels or elephants .
 There was only a picnic of Sunday school kids , and little kids at that .
 We broke it up and chased the kids to the hollow , but we didn’t get anything from them except some donuts and jam .
 Ben Rogers got a rag doll and Jo Harper got a hymnal and a Bible , but we had to drop everything and run when the teacher came running over .
 I didn’t see any diamonds , and I made sure Tom Sawyer knew it .
 But he said there were tons of them , as well as Arabs and elephants and stuff .
 I asked why I couldn’t see them , and he said I wouldn’t have to ask if I weren’t so ignorant and had read a book called Don Quixote .
 He said it was all done by magic .
 He said there were hundreds of soldiers and elephants and treasure and so on .
 He said we’d be able to see it all if our enemies , who were magicians , hadn’t transformed the whole thing into a Sunday school picnic , just so they could laugh at us .
 So I said , okay , then we should go after the magicians .
 Tom Sawyer said I was a numskull .
 
.
Why , a magician could summon a lot of genies ,  he said , and they would carve you up like mincemeat before you could say Jack Robinson .
 They’re as tall as a tree and as big around as a church .
 
.
How are you going to get any genies .
 
.
I don’t know .
 How did the magicians get them .
 
.
Who makes them do such things .
 
.
Whoever rubs the lamp or ring , that’s who .
 Whoever does the rubbing becomes the person in charge of the genies , and they have to do whatever he says .
 If he tells them to build a diamond palace that’s forty miles long and fill it with chewing gum or whatever else you want and then get you a daughter of the emperor of China for you to marry , then the genies have got to do it—before sun-up the next day , too .
 What’s more , they’ve got to put that palace anywhere you want it .
 
.
Listen to yourself talk , Huck Finn .
 You’d HAVE to come when he rubbed your lamp , whether you wanted to or not .
 
.
Geez , it’s no use talking to you , Huck Finn .
 You don’t seem to know anything—you’re a perfect moron .
 
.
Why you’re all out of breath , my boy .
 Did you come to collect some of the interest you’ve made on your money .
 
.
No , sir ,  I said .
 Is there any .
 
.
Why , what do you mean , my boy .
 
.
Don’t ask me any questions about it , please ,  I said .
 You’ll take it , though , won’t you .
 
.
He said : 
.
Well , I’m confused .
 Is something wrong .
 
.
Please take it ,  I said , and don’t as me any questions , because I don’t want to have to lie to you .
 
.
He thought for a moment , then said : 
.
Ah ha .
 I think I understand .
 You want to SELL all your property to me , not give it away .
 That’s what you mean .
 
.
Then he wrote something on a piece of paper , looked it over , and said : 
.
So I signed it and then left .
 
.
When I lit my candle and went up to my room that night , I found a man sitting there—it was pap .
 
.
Your clothes are all starched .
 You think you’re pretty high and might , DON’T you .
 
.
Maybe I am , maybe I ain’t ,  I said .
 
.
Don’t you give me any lip ,  he said .
 You’ve been putting on airs since I’ve been away .
 I’ll bring you down a notch before I get done with you .
 They say you’re educated now too , that you can read and write .
 You think you’re better than your father now , don’t you , because he can’t read and write .
 I’ll teach you a lesson .
 Who told you that you could dabble in such ridiculous nonsense .
 Who told you , huh .
 
.
The widow .
 She told me .
 
.
The widow , huh .
 And who told the widow she could stick her nose in other people’s business .
 
.
Nobody ever told her .
 
.
Well , I’ll teach her to interfere .
 And you listen to me—you stop going to school now , you hear .
 I’ll teach them to raise a boy to put on airs over his own father and pretend to be better than what he is .
 If I catch you around that school again , you’ll get it .
 Your mother couldn’t read or write when she died .
 And none of the rest of your family could before they died .
 I can’t .
 Yet here you are puffing yourself up .
 I won’t stand for it , you hear .
 Now , let me hear you read something .
 
.
I picked up a book and began to read something about General George Washington and the Revolutionary War .
 When I’d read for about thirty seconds , he hit the book with his hand and knocked it across the room .
 He said : 
.
He picked up a little blue and yellow picture of a boy and some cows and said : 
.
What’s this .
 
.
It’s just something the teachers gave me for learning my lessons well .
 
.
He tore it up and said : 
.
I’ll give you something better—I’ll give you a beating .
 
.
He sat there mumbling and growling for a minute before saying : 
.
Ain’t you a sweet smelling little sissy .
 You’ve got a bed .
 And sheets .
 And a mirror and a rug on the floor .
 You’ve got all that while your father sleeps with the pigs in the tanyard .
 I never saw such a son .
 I bet I can beat some of this fanciness out of you before I’m done .
 And that’s not all .
 They say you’re rich .
 How’d that happen .
 
.
That’s a lie—that’s how it happened .
 
.
Now look here—watch how you talk to me .
 I’ve taken about all I can take , so don’t sass me .
 I’ve been in town only two days , but all I’ve heard about is how you’ve gotten rich .
 I heard about it way down the river , too .
 That’s why I came back , because I want it .
 You get me that money tomorrow .
 
.
But I ain’t got any money .
 
.
I don’t care what you want it for—just give it to me .
 
.
He took it and bit it to see if it was real silver .
 Then he said he was going down to the town to buy some whisky because he hadn’t had a drink all day .
 When he’d climbed out the window and was standing on the shed , he poked his head back in again and swore at me for putting on airs and trying to be better than him .
 And just when I thought he’d gone , he came back and put his head in again and told me not to go back to school because he’d be watching and beat me if I didn’t stop .
 
.
Next day he went to Judge Thatcher’s house drunk , and harassed him and tried to make him pay up the money .
 He didn’t have any luck , though , and he swore he’d sue him to make him pay .
 
.
When pap got out of jail , the new judge said he’d make a new man out of him .
 He took pap to his house , dressed him up in nice clean clothes , and had him over for breakfast , lunch , and dinner with the family as if they were old friends .
 After supper he talked to pap about temperanceabstaining from alcoholtemperance and such things til my old man cried .
 He said he’d been a fool and had squandered away his entire life .
 But he said he would turn over a new leaf and become the kind of man that other wouldn’t be ashamed of .
 He said he hoped the new judge wouldn’t look down on him , but instead would help him .
 The new judge said he was so proud he could give pap a hug .
 He cried too and so did his wife .
 Pap said he’d been misunderstood his whole life and just needed some sympathy .
 The new judge believed him , and they cried some more until it was time for bed and my old man stood up , held out his hand , and said : 
.
The new judge was angry .
 He said he guessed the only way to reform my old man would be with a shotgun .
 
.
Well , pretty soon my old man was up and about again .
 He sued Judge Thatcher for that money .
 He also went after me for continuing to go to school .
 He caught me a couple times and beat me fiercely , but I continued to go to school just the same and usually just avoided pap or outran him .
 I didn’t really want to go to school before , but I figured I’d go now just to spite pap .
 The lawsuit was slow , and it looked like they were never going to start the process , so every now and then I’d borrow two or three dollars from Judge Thatcher to keep pap from beating me .
 Every time he got money , he’d get drunk , and every time he got drunk , he tore up the town .
 And every time he tore up the town , he got thrown in jail .
 This way of life suited him perfectly—it was right in his line of work .
 
.
After supper pap took the jug of whisky and said he had enough to get drunk twice and get the delirium tremensdelirium experienced by the most severe alcoholics during withdrawaldelirium tremens once .
 That’s the word he always used .
 I figured in about an hour he’d be so drunk he’d be blind .
 This would be my chance to either steal the key or finish sawing the hole in the wall and crawl out .
 He drank and drank and eventually tumbled down on to his blankets .
 But luck wasn’t with me , since instead of falling sound asleep , he just rolled around uncomfortably .
 He groaned and moaned and thrashed around for such a long time that I got sleepy just waiting for him to sleep .
 Before I knew it , I’d fallen sound asleep , and even left the candle burning .
 
.
I don’t know how long I slept , but I woke up when I suddenly heard this awful scream .
 There was pap looking crazy , and jumping around everywhere .
 He was yelling about snakes , saying they were crawling up his legs .
 He even said one had bitten him on the cheek .
 I looked around , but I couldn’t see any snakes .
 He ran around the cabin screaming , Get him off .
 Get him off .
 He’s biting me on the neck .
  I never saw a man whose eyes looked so wild and crazy .
 Pretty soon he’d exhausted himself and fell down panting .
 Then he rolled around as fast as lightening , kicking things , punching , grabbing at the air with his hands .
 He was screaming and saying that devils had gotten ahold of him .
 Pretty soon he’d worn himself out , and lay still in the corner of the cabin , moaning .
 Then he lay perfectly still and didn’t make a sound .
 I could hear the owls and the wolves off in the distant woods , and everything seemed incredibly still .
 Soon , though , he raised himself half way up , cocked his head to one side as if listening , and said : 
.
Then he got down on all fours and crawled off , begging his hallucinations to leave him alone .
 He rolled himself up in his blanket and curled up under the old pine table , begging to be left alone .
 Then I could hear him crying through the blanket .
 
.
Get up .
 What are you doing .
 
.
I opened my eyes and looked around , trying to figure out where I was .
 The sun had come up , and I had been sound asleep .
 Pap was standing over me with a sour , sick look on his face .
 He said : 
.
What are you doing with that gun .
 
.
I figured that he didn’t remember what he’d done last night , so I said : 
.
Somebody tried to break in , so I was waiting for him to come back .
 
.
Why didn’t you wake me up .
 
.
I was pretty close to the cabin , and I kept thinking I heard my old man coming .
 But I managed to hide the canoe .
 When I was done , I peered through the willows and saw the old man down the path a little bit , aiming at a bird with his gun .
 Great—he hadn’t seen anything .
 
.
Next time someone comes prowling around here you wake me up , okay .
 That guy from last night wasn’t up to any good .
 I would have shot him .
 Next time , you wake me up , okay .
 
.
I’d worn a pretty clear path in the ground crawling out of the hole and dragging so many things down to the canoe , so I fixed it as best I could by scattering dust all over the place .
 This covered up the sawdust and the worn dirt .
 Then I put back the piece of wall that I’d cut out , and put two rocks under it one against it , to hold it up since it didn’t quite touch the ground .
 When I finished , you couldn’t even tell there was a hole unless you already know it was there and were standing about four or five feet away .
 Besides , the hole was in the rear of the cabin , and it wasn’t likely that anyone would go poking around back there .
 
.
The ground from the cabin and the canoe was covered in grass , so I didn’t have to worry about leaving tracks .
 I went back to check , though .
 I stood on the riverbank and looked out .
 It looked safe , so I tok the gun and went up into the woods a little bit .
 I was hunting around for some birds , when I saw a wild pig .
 Hogs would go wild pretty soon after they’d gotten away from prarie farms .
 I shot him and took him back to the cabin .
 
.
I was pretty tired , and before I knew it , I’d fallen asleep .
 When I woke up , I didn’t know where I was for about a minute .
 I sat up and looked around , feeling a little bit scared .
 Then I remembered .
 The river looked like it was miles and miles wide .
 The moon was shining so brightly that I could have counted the logs that went drifting by , all black and still and hundreds of yards away from the shore .
 It was late—everything was dead quiet and it looked and even SMELLED like it was late .
 I don’t know quite how to put it , but you know what I mean .
 
.
I yawned a big yawn and stretched .
 I was just going to unhitch the canoe and head out when suddenly I heard a sound out on the water .
 I listened , and pretty soon I heard it again .
 It was that dull kind of sound that oars make in the still of the night when they work against the rowlocks of a rowboat .
 I peered out through the willow branches , and saw a skiff out on the water , though , I couldn’t tell how many people where in it .
 It kept coming toward me , and when it had pulled up near the canoe I could see that there was only one man in it .
 Maybe it’s pap , I thought to myself , though I wasn’t expecting him .
 The man in the boat floated past me with the current and soon started rowing toward the shore when he was in calmer water .
 He went so close past me that I could have reached out with the gun and touched him .
 Turns out it WAS pap—and I could tell that he was sober by the way he laid his oars in the boat .
 
.
It didn’t take me long to make my way to the island .
 The current was so swift that I quickly shot past the head of the island .
 Then I reach the still waters and landed the canoe on the side of the island toward the Illinois shoreline .
 I parted the willow branches and ran the canoe into a deep dent in the riverbank that I knew about .
 Nobody could have seen the canoe from the water once I’d secured it in place .
 
.
I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke and kept on watching .
 The ferry was floating with the current , and I figured it would come so close to where I was sitting , just like the bread had , that I’d have a chance to see who was on board .
 When it got close , I put out my pipe and went to the spot where I pulled out the bread and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place .
 I could peer through in the spot where the log forked .
 
.
Pretty soon the ferry came along .
 It got so close to me that they could have extended a plank and walked to shore .
 Almost everyone I knew was on board : pap , Judge Thatcher , Bessie Thatcher , Jo Harper , Tom Sawyer and his old Aunt Polly , Sid and Mary , and plenty of others .
 Everyone was talking about the murder , until the captain interrupted and said : 
.
Look sharp now .
 The current comes closest to land here , and maybe he has washed ashore and gotten tangled among the brush at the water’s edge .
 I hope so anyway .
 
.
I knew I was all right now—no one would be coming looking for me any more .
 I got my traps out of the canoe and made a nice little camp in the thick woods .
 I used my blankets to fashion a makeshift tent to put my things under so that the rain wouldn’t get them wet .
 I caught a catfish and cut it open with my saw .
 Toward sundown , I lit my campfire and had supper .
 Then I set up a fishing line to catch some fish for breakfast .
 
.
I wandered around in the deep woods until I figured I wasn’t too far from the foot of the island .
 I had my gun with me , but I hadn’t shot anything—I kept it for protection .
 Maybe I’d kill some game on the way home .
 Around this time I almost stepped on a good-sized snake .
 It went sliding off through the grass and flowers , and I chased after it , trying to get a shot at it .
 I ran along until all of a sudden I came to the ashes of a campfire that were still smoking .
 
.
We better camp here if we can find a good place .
 The horses are pretty much beat .
 Let’s look around .
 
.
I didn’t wait , but shoved off and paddled away .
 I tied the canoe up back in the old place on the island , and reckoned I’d just sleep in it .
 
.
Hell , Jim .
  and jumped out from my hiding place in the bushes .
 
.
He jumped up and stared at me wildly .
 Then he dropped down to his knees , put his hands together , and said : 
.
It’s full daylight now .
 Let’s get breakfast .
 Why don’t you get the fire going again .
 
.
What’s the use making up a campfire to cook strawberries and the like .
 You don’t have a gun , don’t you .
 If you had a gun , we can get something better than strawberries .
 
.
Stawberries and stuff ,  I repeated .
 Is that what you live on .
 
.
I couldn’t get anything else ,  he said .
 
.
Why , how long have you been on the island , Jim .
 
.
I came here the night after you were killed .
 
.
Yes indeed .
 
.
And you haven’t had anything to eat but that kind of junk .
 
.
No sir , nothing else .
 
.
Well , you must be almost starved then , aren’t you .
 
.
I bet I could eat a horse .
 I really could .
 How long have you been on the island .
 
.
Since the night I got killed .
 
.
No .
 What have you been eating .
 Oh , but you have a gun .
 Yep , you have a gun .
 That’s good .
 Now you go and kill something , and I’ll cook it up on the fire .
 
.
When breakfast was ready , we lounged on the grass and ate it while it was still smoking hot .
 Since Jim was half-starved , he set to eating with all his might .
 Once we were stuffed , he lazed about .
 Eventually , Jim said : 
.
I told him the whole story , and he said it was pretty smart .
 He said Tom Sawyer couldn’t have come up with a better plan than that .
 Then I said : 
.
He looked pretty uncomfortable , and didn’t saying anything for a minute .
 Then he said : 
.
Maybe I shouldn’t tell you .
 
.
Why , Jim .
 
.
Well , I have my reasons .
 But you wouldn’t tell on me if I were to tell you , would you , Huck .
 
.
I’ll be damned if I would , Jim .
 
.
Well , I believe you , Huck .
 I… I ran away .
 
.
Jim .
 
.
Well , when it got dark , I snuck up the river road and went about two miles or more to where there weren’t any houses .
 I’d made up my mind about what I was going to do .
 You see , if I kept trying to run away on foot , the dogs would track me down .
 But if I stole a skiff to cross the river , they’d miss the skiff and would know I’d landed on the other side .
 Then they would be able to pick up my tracks .
 So , I said to myself , I need a raft because it won’t leave ANY tracks .
 
.
So all this time you haven’t had any meat or bread to eat .
 Why didn’t you get some mud turtles .
 
.
Well , that’s true .
 You’ve had to stay in the woods this whole time , of course .
 Did you hear them shooting the cannon .
 
.
Oh yes .
 I knew they were looking for you .
 I saw them go by here—I watched them through the bushes .
 
.
Jim also said if was bad luck to count the things that you are going to cook for dinner .
 The same thing would happen if you shook out the tablecloth after sundown .
 And he said that if a man who owned a beehive died , the bees had to be told about it before sun up the next morning .
 Otherwise the bees would be so weak that they would quit work and die .
 Jim said bees wouldn’t sting idiots , but I didn’t believe that because I’d played around with bees lots of times and they never stung me .
 
.
I’d heard some of these superstitions before , but not all of them .
 Jim knew about all kinds of signs .
 He said he knew almost all of them .
 I said it seemed to me that all the signs were about bad luck , so I asked him if there were any good luck signs .
 He said : 
.
Do you have hairy arms and a hairy chest , Jim .
 
.
Why ask that question .
 Can’t you see that I do .
 
.
Well , are you rich .
 
.
What did you invest in , Jim .
 
.
Well , first I bought some stock .
 
.
What kid of stock .
 
.
Livestock—cattle .
 I invested ten dollars in a cow .
 But I’m not going to risk any more money in stock .
 The cow up and died before it went to market .
 
.
So you lost the ten dollars .
 
.
No , I didn’t lose it all .
 I only lost about nine of it .
 I sold the hide and tail for a dollar and ten cents .
 
.
So you have five dollars and ten cents left .
 Did you invest any more after that .
 
.
So I did .
 Then I figured I’d invest the thirty-five dollars initially to keep things moving .
 There was a n----- named Bob that had caught a wooden flata piece of straight timber used to build shipsflat in the river without his master’s knowledge .
 I bought it off him and told him I’d give him thirty-five dollars at the end of the year .
 But someone stole the flat that night , and the next day the one-legged n----- said the bank had gone bust .
 So none of us got our money back .
 
.
So what did you do with the remaining ten cents , Jim .
 
.
Well , I was going to spend it , but I had a dream that told me to give it to a n----- named Balum .
 His nickname was Balum’s Ass , because he’s a chucklehead , you know .
 But they say he’s lucky , and I knew I certainly wasn’t lucky .
 The dream said to let Balum invest the ten cents for me so that I could make a profit .
 Well , Balum had heard a preacher in church who said that whoever gave money to the poor was lending to the Lord and was bound to get his money back a hundred times over .
 So he donated the ten cents and then waited to see what would happen .
 
.
And what happened , Jim .
 
.
Well , it’s okay anyway , Jim , as long as you’re going to be rich again at some point .
 
.
I wanted to go and look at a spot in the middle of the island that I’d found while exploring .
 We set out and , since the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide , we got to it in no time .
 
.
This place I wanted to go back to was a long , steep hill or ridge that was about forty feet tall .
 We had a tough time climbing to the top because the sides were so steep and the bushes so thick .
 We hiked and climbed all over it until we found a large cave in the rocks at the top on the side that faces toward Illinois .
 The cave was about the size of two or three rooms , and Jim could stand up straight in it .
 The temperature was cool inside .
 Jim wanted to put our traps in there right away , but I said we didn’t want to be climbing up and down the hill all the time .
 
.
Jim , this is nice ,  I said .
 I don’t want to be anywhere else but here .
 Pass me another hunk of fish and some hot cornbread .
 
.
Well , you wouldn’t be here if it hadn’t been for Jim .
 You’d have been down in the woods without any dinner and getting soaked , too .
 Yep , you sure would , man .
 Chickens know when it’s going to rain and so do the birds , kid .
 
.
The river kept rising for ten or twelve days until it had finally flowed over the banks .
 The water was three or four feet deep on the lower parts of the island and on the Illinois side of the island .
 It was several miles wide on the Illinois side , but it was the same distance across as it normally was on the Missouri side—about half a mile—because the Missouri shore was nothing but high bluffs .
 
.
Another night when we were up at the head of the island just before dawn , a frame house came floating down the river on the west side of the island .
 It was a two-story house that was tilted over to one side .
 We paddled out to it and climbed in through an upstairs window .
 But it was still too dark to see anything , so we hid the canoe and sat inside to wait for daylight .
 
.
Hello there .
 
.
But it didn’t budge .
 So I yelled again , and then Jim said : 
.
That man isn’t asleep—he’s dead .
 You hold the canoe still , and I’ll go and see .
 
.
He went over to the man , bend down and looked , and said : 
.
It’s a dead man .
 Yes , indeed .
 He’s naked too .
 He’s been shot in the back .
 I reckon he’s been dead two or three days .
 Come on in , Huck , but don’t look at his face—it’s too ghastly .
 
.
Now you think it’s bad luck .
 But what did you say when I brought in the snakeskin that I found on the top of the ridge the day before yesterday .
 You said it was the worst luck in the world to touch a snakeskin with my hands .
 Well , here’s your bad luck .
 We’ve raked in all this loot and an extra eight dollars to go with it .
 I wish we could have had some bad luck like this every day , Jim .
 
.
Nevermind , honey , nevermind .
 Don’t get all worked up .
 The bad luck is coming , mind you .
 It’s coming .
 
.
After dark , I took the canoe over to the Illinois shore .
 
.
Come in ,  said the woman .
 I went in , and she said : Have a seat .
 
.
I sat down .
 She looked me up and down with her shiny little eyes and said : 
.
What might your name be .
 
.
Sarah Williams .
 
.
Where do you live .
 In this neighborhood .
 
.
No , ma’am .
 I live in Hookerville , seven miles down stream .
 I walked all the way here , and I’m exhausted .
 
.
You’re hungry , too , I imagine .
 I’ll find you something to eat .
 
.
No , ma’am , I’m not hungry .
 I was so hungry that I stopped at a farm two miles back .
 I ate there , so I’m not hungry any more .
 That’s why I’m so late getting here .
 My mother’s sick in bed , and I’ve come here to tell my uncle Abner Moore that she’s run out of money .
 She said that he lives at the north end of town .
 I’ve never been here before .
 Do you know him .
 
.
No ,  I said .
 I’ll rest awhile , I figure , and then go on .
 I’m not afraid of the dark .
 
.
Who did it .
 We’ve heard a lot about the murder down in Hookerville , but we don’t know who killed Huck Finn .
 
.
Well , I imagine there are quite a few people HERE who’d like to know who killed him , too .
 Some think old man Finn killed Huck himself .
 
.
No—is that so .
 
.
That’s what almost everyone thought at first .
 He’ll never know how close he was to being hanged .
 But before nightfall , they changed their minds and figured that Huck had been killed by a runaway n----- named Jim .
 
.
But he…
.
Yes , I guess so , ma’am .
 I don’t see what would stop him .
 Has everyone stopped thinking that the n----- did it , then .
 
.
Well , have they started looking for him yet .
 
.
Three hundred dollars is an awful lot of money .
 I wish my mother could get it .
 Is your husband over there tonight .
 
.
Why , yes .
 He went to the north of town with the other man I was telling you about to see if they could get a boat and borrow another gun .
 They’ll go over after midnight .
 
.
Won’t they be able to see better if they wait until the daytime .
 
.
I didn’t think of that .
 
.
The woman kept looking at me funny , which made me feel really uneasy .
 Pretty soon she said : 
.
What did you say your name was , honey .
 
.
M—Mary Williams .
 
.
Somehow , Mary didn’t seem like the name I’d given before .
 It seemed to me I’d said it was Sarah .
 I sort of felt cornered and was afraid that I looked cornered too , so I didn’t look up .
 I wished the woman would say something—the longer she sat still the worse I felt .
 But then she said : 
.
Honey , I thought you said your name was Sarah when you first came in .
 
.
Oh yes , ma’am , I did .
 Sarah Mary Williams .
 Sarah’s my first name .
 Some people call me Sarah , others call me Mary .
 
.
Oh , that’s how it is .
 
.
Yes , ma’am .
 
.
I felt better then , but I still wished I wasn’t there anymore .
 I still couldn’t look up .
 
.
Keep your eye on the rats .
 You better have the lead bar ready in your lap .
 
.
Come on now , what’s your real name .
 
.
Wh—what , ma’am .
 
.
What’s your real name .
 Is it Bill or Tom or Bob .
 What is it .
 
.
Goshen , child .
 This ain’t Goshen .
 This is StPetersburg .
 Goshen’s ten miles further up the river .
 Who told you this was Goshen .
 
.
Why , a man I met at dawn this morning , just as I was heading into the woods to sleep .
 He told me that when I came to a fork in the road I had to veer right and it would be only five miles to Goshen .
 
.
He was drunk , I’ll bet .
 He told you the exact opposite of what you should have done .
 
.
Well , he did act drunk .
 But it doesn’t matter now .
 I’d better get moving so I can reach Goshen before daylight .
 
.
Hold on a minute .
 I’ll pack you a snack to eat .
 You might want it later .
 
.
She packed a snak for me , then said : 
.
Hey , if a cow is lying down , which end of its body does it lift first when it gets up .
 Answer quickly now—don’t think .
 Which end gets up first .
 
.
The rear end , ma’am .
 
.
What about a horse .
 
.
The front end , ma’am .
 
.
Which side of a tree does moss grow on .
 
.
The north side .
 
.
If fifteen cows are grazing on a hillside , how many of them eat with their heads pointed in the same direction .
 
.
All fifteen , ma’am .
 
.
Well , I guess you HAVE lived in the country .
 I thought maybe you were lying again .
 What’s your real name , now .
 
.
George Peters , ma’am .
 
.
After that , I jumped in the canoe and started paddling as hard as I could toward our new place about a mile and a half downstream .
 I landed and ran through the woods and up the ridge into the cave .
 Jim was there , lying fast asleep .
 I woke him up , and said : 
.
Get up and get going , Jim .
 There’s not a minute to lose .
 They’re after us .
 
.
I paddled the canoe out from the shore a little ways to see what I could see .
 If there was a boat nearby , I couldn’t see it by just the light of the stars and shadows .
 Then we untied the raft and paddled it downstream in the shade , past the foot of the island , as quietly as we could , never saying a word .
 
.
When the first ray of sunlight stretched over the horizon , we tied the canoe up to a towhead—a sandbar covered in thick groves of cottonwood trees—in a big bend on the Illinois side of the river .
 We hacked off some cottonwood branches with the hatchet , and used them to covered up the raft so it looked like there had been a cave-in on the riverbank .
 
.
Every now and then we’d shoot a waterfowl that woke up too early or went to bed too late .
 All in all , we lived pretty well .
 
.
Let’s land on it , Jim .
 
.
Jim didn’t want to at first .
 He said , 
.
I don’t want to go fooling around on that wreck .
 We’re doing fine without it , and we’d better let it alone , like the Bible says .
 More likely than not there are guards protecting that wreck .
 
.
Jim grumbled a bit , but he gave in .
 He said we mustn’t talk anymore than was absolutely necessary , and only then in low voices .
 The lightning flashes showed us the way to the wreck , and we grabbed hold of the starboard derrickpart of the framework of the boatderrick and tied the raft to it .
 
.
Jim whispered to me that he had a bad feeling about this .
 He told me we better get going .
 I agreed and was about to head for the raft when I heard a voice from below cry out : 
.
Oh please don’t , guys .
 I swear I won’t ever tell .
 
.
Another voice then said pretty loudly : 
.
You’re lying , Jim Turner .
 You’ve acted like this before .
 You always want more than your share of the loot , and you always get it , because you’ve sworn you’d tell if you didn’t get it .
 Well , you’ve joked around one too many times .
 You’re the most awful , most treacherous rascal around .
 
.
I’d LIKE to shoot you .
 And I ought to , you damned skunk .
 
.
The man on the floor would curl up and say things like , Oh , please don’t , Bill .
 I’m not ever going to tell .
 
.
And every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and say : 
.
Indeed you won’t .
 You’ve never said a truer word than that .
  Once he said : Listen to him beg .
 But if we hadn’t beaten him and tied him up , he would’ve killed us both .
 And what FOR .
 Because he could .
 Just because we stood up for our RIGHTS , that’s why .
 But I swear you aren’t going to threaten anybody ever again , Jim Turner .
 Put that pistol away , Bill .
 
.
Bill said : 
.
But I’ve got my reasons for not wanting him killed .
 
.
Hey—come in here .
 
.
He said he’ll tell , and he will .
 Even if we gave both our shares to him now , it wouldn’t make any difference , now that we’ve fought him and tied him up .
 I’m sure he’ll turn state’s evidence and testify against us .
 Now you listen .
 I say we put him out of his misery .
 
.
I agree ,  said Packard quietly .
 
.
Damn it , I was beginning to think you weren’t .
 Well then , that’s that .
 Let’s go and do it .
 
.
You bet .
 But how are you thinking of killing him .
 
.
Yes , I suppose you are .
 But what if the boat doesn’t break up and wash away .
 
.
Well , we can wait a couple hours and see , can’t we .
 
.
Put that damn lantern out , Bill .
 
.
He flung a bag of something into the boat , and then climbed in and sat down .
 It was Packard .
 Then Bill came out and climbed aboard .
 Packard said in a low voice : 
.
All right—off we go .
 
.
I was so weak that I could barely hang onto the shutters .
 But I heard Bill say : 
.
Hold on—did you do it .
 
.
No .
 Didn’t you .
 
.
No .
 So he’s still got his share of the cash .
 
.
Well , come on then .
 No use in taking loot and leaving money behind .
 
.
Hey , won’t he suspect that we’re up to something .
 
.
Maybe , maybe not .
 But we’ve got to get it—can’t just leave it here .
 Come on .
 
.
So they got out of the boat , climbed back on board the steamboat , and went back inside the cabins .
 
.
The door slammed shut because it was on the side of the boat that was tilted upward .
 I jumped in the boat in a split second , and Jim came running after me .
 I got out my knife , cut the rope , and away we went .
 
.
It was the raft .
 We were so glad to get back on board .
 We saw a light to the right on the shore , so I said we should head toward it .
 The skiff was half full of the loot that the gang had stolen from the wreck , so we piled all up on the raft .
 I told Jim to stay on the raft and float about two miles downstream .
 There , he should make a fire and keep it burning til I came back .
 I picked up the oars in the skiff and started rowing toward the light on the shore .
 As I got closer , I could see a few more lights and realized it was a village up on a hillside .
 I continued heading toward the light and as I got closer , I saw that it was a lantern hangingin on a ferry .
 I looked for the ferry’s watchman , wondering where he’d be sleeping .
 Eventually I found him sitting near the bittspost on the deck of a ship used to anchor the ship to the dock with cablebitts at the front of the boat .
 He was asleep with his head resting between his knees .
 I nudged his shoulder two or three times and began to cry .
 
.
He woke up startled , but when he saw who it was , he only yawned and stretched .
 Then he said : 
.
Hey , what’s up .
 Don’t cry , kid .
 What’s the matter .
 
.
I said : 
.
Then I broke down in tears .
 He said : 
.
Come now , don’t cry like that .
 We all have our problems , and yours will work out in the end .
 What’s the matter with your family .
 
.
I interrupted him and said : 
.
WHO is .
 
.
Up where .
 Where are they .
 
.
On the wreck .
 
.
What wreck .
 
.
Well , there’s only one .
 
.
What , you don’t mean the wreck of the steamboat Walter Scott .
 
.
Yes .
 
.
Good God .
 What are they doing there , for goodness sake .
 
.
Well , they didn’t go there on purpose .
 
.
I’m sure they didn’t .
 My God , they don’t stand a chance if I don’t get them off there fast enough .
 Why , how in the world did they ever get into such a mess .
 
.
Well , Miss Hooker visiting in the town up there… .
 
.
My word .
 That’s the craziest thing I’ve ever heard .
 What did you all do after that .
 
.
It seemed a might long time before I saw Jim’s light .
 It seemed a thousand miles away when I finally saw it .
 The sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east by the time I got there , so we headed for an island .
 We hid the raft , sunk the skiff , went to bed , and slept like the dead .
 
.
Isn’t that something .
 And what do they have to do to get that money , Huck .
 
.
No way .
 Really .
 
.
Hang out where .
 
.
The harem .
 
.
What’s the harem .
 
.
Well , whatever .
 He WAS the wisest man , since that’s what the widow told me so herself .
 
.
Yes , the widow told me about that .
 
.
Who .
 Me .
 Get outta here .
 Don’t talk to me about your points .
 I imagine I know common sense when I see it , and there isn’t any sense in that .
 The women’s dispute wasn’t about half a child , it was about a whole child .
 And any man who thinks he can settle a dispute about a whole child by giving a woman half a child wouldn’t be smart enough to know to come inside when it rains .
 Don’t talk to man any more about Solomon , Huck .
 I know enough already .
 
.
But I’m telling you you’re not getting the point .
 
.
Poor little kid .
 
.
But others say he escaped and came to America .
 
.
No .
 
.
Then he can’t go back to the way of life he’s used to .
 What’s he going to do .
 
.
Well , I don’t know .
 Some of them become policemen and others teach people how to speak French .
 
.
Well I’ll be damned .
 How did that come to be .
 
.
I don’t know , but it’s true .
 I learned some of their nonsense out of a book .
 Suppose a man came up to you and said , Polly voo franzy .
 What would you think about that .
 
.
I wouldn’t think at all .
 I’d hit him over the head—if he’s not a white man , that is .
 I wouldn’t allow a n----- to call me a name like that .
 
.
Well then why wouldn’t he just SAY that .
 
.
But he IS saying that .
 That’s the way a Frenchman says it .
 
.
Look , Jim .
 Does a cat talk like we do .
 
.
No , a cat doesn’t .
 
.
Well , does a cow talk like we do .
 
.
No , a cow doesn’t either .
 
.
No , they don’t .
 
.
Isn’t it natural and proper that they talk differently than each other .
 
.
Of course .
 
.
And isn’t it natural and proper that a cat and cow talk differently from humans .
 
.
Why , of course it is .
 
.
Well then , why isn’t it natural and proper for a Frenchman to talk differently than us .
 Answer me that .
 
.
Is a cat a man , Huck .
 
.
No .
 
.
Well then , it wouldn’t make any sense for a cat to talk like a man .
 Is a cow a man .
 I mean , is a cow a cat .
 
.
No , a cow is neither a man nor a cat .
 
.
Well then , a cow’s got no business talking like either one of them .
 Is a Frenchman a man .
 
.
Yes .
 
.
Well , there you go .
 Darn it , then why doesn’t a Frenchman TALK like a man .
 Answer me THAT .
 
.
I saw it was no use wasting words—you can’t teach a n----- how to argue .
 So I quit .
 
.
At that point , I gave up .
 I figured out what was going on .
 The steep bank was on an island , and Jim had floated down the other side of it .
 This wasn’t a towhead that you could float past in ten minutes .
 It was a regular island with big trees on it .
 It might be five or six miles long and more than half a mile wide .
 
.
I kept quiet with my ears cocked for what I imagine was about fifteen minutes .
 I was still floating along at about four or five miles an hour , though I wasn’t really didn’t notice .
 At a time like that , you FEEL like you’re sitting still on the water .
 If a see a snag slip past you don’t think to yourself how fast YOU’RE going .
 Instead , you catch your breath and think about how fast that snag is moving .
 If you don’t think it isn’t sad and loney being out in a fog by yourself at night , then try it sometime .
 You’ll see what I mean .
 
.
When I got to it , Jim was sitting there asleep with his head down between his knees and his right arm hanging over the steering oar .
 The other oar had smashed off , and the raft was littered with leaves and branches and dirt .
 The raft looked like it’d had rough time coming down the river .
 
.
What’s the matter with you , Jim .
 Have you been drinking .
 
.
Drinking .
 Have I been drinking .
 Have I had the chance to drink .
 
.
Well then , why are you talking so crazy .
 
.
Gone .
 Why , what do you mean .
 I haven’t been gone at all .
 Where would I go .
 
.
Well , it’s pretty obvious you’re here , but I think you’re a mixed up old fool , Jim .
 
.
I am , am I .
 Well , answer me this : Didn’t you get out the rope in the canoe so that we could tie ourselves up to the towhead .
 
.
No , I didn’t .
 What towhead .
 I haven’t seen any towheads .
 
.
What fog .
 
.
Come on , how could I dream all that in ten minutes .
 
.
Well , darn it , you did dream it because none of it happened .
 
.
It doesn’t matter how plain it seemed .
 Your story isn’t .
 I know because I’ve been here the whole time .
 
.
Well , then , I guess I did dream it , Huck .
 But I’ll be damned if that wasn’t the most intense dream I’ve ever had .
 And I’ve never had a dream before that’s made me as tired as this one did .
 
.
Oh , well that’s alright because dreams can really wear you out sometimes .
 This one seems to have been a doozy , though .
 Tell me all about it , Jim .
 
.
It had gotten pretty cloudy shortly after I’d gotten on the raft , but it was starting to clear up again .
 
.
Well , your interpretation is pretty good , Jim ,  I said .
 But what do THESE things stand for .
 
.
I was referring to the smashed oar and the leaves and debris on the raft .
 You could see them pretty clearly now .
 
.
Jim looked at the debris , then at me , then back at the debris again .
 He’d gotten the dream fixed so firmly in his mind that he couldn’t let go of it and confront the facts .
 But when he did piece it together and he realized what had really happened , he looked at me with a serious expression and said : 
.
Then he got up slowly and walked to the wigwam .
 He went in without saying another word , but what he’d said had been enough .
 I felt so awful that I almost kissed HIS feet to get him to take back what he’d said .
 
.
It took me fifteen minutes to work myself up to apologize to a n----- .
 But I did it , and I wasn’t ashamed of it afterwards .
 I never played any more mean tricks on him after that , and I would have never played that one if I had known it would make him feel that way .
 
.
All we could do at this point was to keep a sharp eye out for the town so as not to miss it .
 Jim said he wouldn’t miss it because he’d be a free man the minute he saw it , but would be back in slave country again without an ounce of freedom if he missed it .
 Every now and then he’d jump up and say : 
.
Is that it .
 
.
We’re safe , Huck , we’re safe .
 Jump up and dance .
 There’s the good old city of Cairo at last , I just know it .
 
.
I said : 
.
I’ll take the canoe and go and see , Jim .
 It might not be Cairo , you know .
 
.
I was paddling off , anxious to tell on him , but when he said this , it seemed to take the zip out of me .
 I went along slowly after that .
 I was no longer sure whether or not I was glad that I’d decided go ashore .
 When I was fifty yards away from the raft , Jim said : 
.
What’s that over there .
 
.
A piece of a raft ,  I said .
 
.
Does it belong to you .
 
.
Yes , sir .
 
.
Any men on it .
 
.
Only one , sir .
 
.
Well , five n------ ran off tonight just up the river , above the head of the bend .
 Is your man white or black .
 
.
I didn’t answer promptly .
 I tried , but the words wouldn’t come .
 I tried for a second or two to brace myself and just say it .
 But I wasn’t man enough—I didn’t have the courage of a rabbit .
 I saw I was losing my strength , so I just gave up trying , and said : 
.
He’s white .
 
.
I reckon we’ll go and see for ourselves .
 
.
The devil with you .
 We’re in a hurry , boy .
 But I suppose we’ve got to .
 Come , start paddling , and let’s get moving .
 
.
I started paddling , and they began rowing with their oars .
 When we had made a couple of strokes , I said : 
.
Well , that’s awfully mean .
 Strange , too .
 Say , boy , what’s the matter with your father .
 
.
It’s the… ah… the uh… well… it’s not much .
 
.
They stopped rowing .
 They were just a short way from the raft by now .
 One said : 
.
Boy , that’s a lie .
 What IS the matter with your pap .
 Do the right thing and answer me honestly now .
 
.
Back , John , row back .
  one of them said .
 They started rowing backward .
 Keep away , boy , keep to port .
 Darn it , the wind is blowing that raft right toward us .
 Your pap’s got smallpoxcontagious and deadly disease that was wiped out in the 20th centurysmallpox , and you know it .
 Why didn’t you just say so .
 Do you want to spread it to everyone .
 
.
Well ,  I said , pretending to cry , Everyone else I’ve told just went away and left us .
 
.
Goodbye , sir ,  I said .
 I won’t let any runaway n------ get by me if I can help it .
 
.
Jim .
 
.
Here I am , Huck .
 Are they out of sight yet .
 Don’t talk too loudly .
 
.
He was in the river under the oar at the stern , with just his nose sticking out .
 I told him they were out of sight , so he came on board .
 He said : 
.
Then we talked about the money .
 It was a pretty good haul—twenty dollars each .
 Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat now , and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free states .
 He said twenty miles more wasn’t far for the raft to go , but he wished we were already there .
 
.
Around ten o’clock that night , we came within sight of the lights of a town way down on a bend on the left bank of the river .
 
.
I set out in the canoe to learn more about the lights .
 Pretty soon I found a man out in the river on a skiff who was setting a trotlinelong fishing line with multiple hooks on ittrotline .
 I pulled up and said : 
.
Mister , is that town over there Cairo .
 
.
Cairo .
 No .
 You must be crazy .
 
.
What town is it , mister .
 
.
If you want to know , go and find out for yourself .
 If you bug me for even another half minute , you’ll get something you’re not going to like .
 
.
Maybe we went past Cairo in the fog that night .
 
.
He said : 
.
Let’s not talk about it , Huck .
 Poor n------ can catch a break .
 I always suspected that rattlesnake skin hadn’t finished giving me my bad luck .
 
.
It isn’t your faul , Huck .
 You didn’t know .
 Don’t blame yourself .
 
.
When it was daylight , I saw that the clear waters of the Ohio River were running along the shore , while in the middle of the river was the muddy waters of the Mississippi .
 We had to give up on Cairo .
 
.
We talked about what to do next .
 We couldn’t go ashore , and we couldn’t take the raft upstream , of course .
 All we could do was to wait for dark and then take our chances paddling upstream in the canoe .
 We slept all day in the cottonwood thicket , so we’d be well rested and refreshed for the long night of paddling ahead .
 But when we went back to the raft around dark , the canoe was gone .
 
.
So we set out after dark on the raft .
 
.
Anyone who doesn’t believe that it’s foolish to handle a snakeskin after hearing about all the bad luck that snakeskin brought us will certainly believe it after they read about what else happened to us .
 
.
I called out for Jim a dozen times without getting an answer .
 So , I grabbed a plank that was floating into me while I was treading water , and headed for the shore , shoving the plank ahead of me as I went .
 I could see that the current was flowing toward the left bank , which meant that I was in a spot where two currents ran into each other .
 So I changed direction and headed with the current .
 
.
In a minute , a voice called out from an open window : 
.
That’s enough , boys .
 Who’s there .
 
.
I said : 
.
It’s me .
 
.
Who’s me .
 
.
George Jackson , sir .
 
.
What do you want .
 
.
I don’t want anything , sir .
 I was just walking by , but your dogs won’t let me .
 
.
What are you doing prowling around here at this time of night , huh .
 
.
Oh , really .
 Will someone strike a match and light a lantern .
 What did you say your name was .
 
.
George Jackson , sir .
 I’m only a boy .
 
.
No , sir , nobody .
 
.
By now I could hear people stirring around in the house , and I saw a light .
 A man called out : 
.
All ready .
 
.
Now , George Jackson , do you know the Shepherdons .
 
.
No , sir .
 I’ve never heard of them .
 
.
Bless you , Saul , the poor thing is as wet as he can be .
 And don’t you think he’s hungry .
 
.
You’re right , Rachel , I forgot .
 
.
So the old lady said : 
.
Buck looked to be around my age—thirteen or fourteen or so—though he was bigger than me .
 He was only wearing a shirt , and he was pretty groggy from having been woken up .
 He came in yawning and rubbing his eyes with one fist and dragging a gun along with the other hand .
 He said : 
.
There aren’t any Shepherdsons around .
 
.
The said , no , that it was a false alarm .
 
.
Well ,  he said , if there had been some , I imagine I would have killed one .
 
.
They all laughed , and Bob said : 
.
Why , Buck , you were so slow in getting here they might have scalped us all .
 
.
Well , guess ,  he said .
 
.
How can I guess ,  I asked , if I’ve never heard of any of this before .
 
.
But you can guess , can’t you .
 It’s easy .
 
.
WHICH candle .
  I asked .
 
.
Well , any candle ,  he said .
 
.
I don’t know where he was ,  I said .
 Where was he .
 
.
Why , he was in the DARK .
 That’s where he was .
 
.
Well , if you knew where he was , why did you ask me .
 
.
Darn it , it’s a riddle .
 Don’t you get it .
 Hey , how long are you going to stay here .
 You should stay here forever .
 We can have a lot of fun together—there isn’t any school now .
 Do you have a dog .
 I’ve got a dog , and he’ll go in the river and fetch wood chips that you throw in .
 Do you like to get all dress up on Sundays and do all that kind of nonsense .
 You can be sure I don’t like to , but ma makes me .
 Darn these awful pants .
 I guess I’d better put them on , but I’d rather not because it’s so warm .
 Are you all set .
 All right , come along , you old horse .
 
.
Can you spell , Buck .
 
.
Yes ,  he said .
 
.
I bet you can’t spell my name ,  I said .
 
.
I bet you I can , even if you think I can’t ,  he said .
 
.
On each side of the clock , there was a big gaudy parrot made out of some chalk-like substance .
 There was a little clay cat next to one parrot and a little clay dog next to the other .
 A squeaking noise came out from under them whenever you pressed down on them , but they didn’t open their mouths or look interested or anything .
 Behind them sat a couple of big fans spread out that looked like the wings of wild turkeys .
 On the table in the middle of the room was a lovely clay basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it .
 They were much more red and yellow and prettier than real fruits , but you could tell they were fake because you could see where pieces of clay had chipped off , showing the white chalk or whatever underneath .

ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS , DECEASED
.
And did young Stephen sicken , 
.
And did young Stephen die .
 
.
And did the sad hearts thicken , 
.
And did the mourners cry .
 
.
No .
 such was not the fate of , 
.
Young Stephen Dowling Bots .
 
.
Though sad hearts round him thickened , 
.
‘Twas not from sickness’s shots .
 
.
No whooping cough did rack his frame , 
.
Nor measles drear with spots .
 
.
Not thes impaired the sacred name , 
.
Of Stephen Dowling Bots .
 
.
Despised love struck not with woe , 
.
That head of curly knots .
 
.
Nor stomach troubles laid him low , 
.
Young Stephen Dowling Bots .
 
.
Oh no .
 Then listen with tearful eye , 
.
Whilst I his fate do tell .
 
.
His soul did from this cold world fly
.
By falling down a well .
 
.
They got him out and emptied him .
 
.
Alas , it was to late .
 
.
His spirit was gone to sport aloft , 
.
In the realms of the good and great .
 
.
Then there was Miss Charlotte .
 She was twenty-five years old , tall , proud , and grand .
 She was as good as a person could be when she wasn’t worked up , but when something stirred her , she could give you a look that would make you wilt on the spot , just like her father could .
 She was beautiful .
 
.
Her sister , Miss Sophia , was also beautiful , but it a different kind of beautiful .
 She was as gentle and sweet as a dove , and she was only twenty .
 
.
There was another aristocratic clan around those parts—made up of five or six families—by the name of Shepherdson .
 They were as high class , wellborn , rich , and grand as the Grangerfords .
 The Shepherdsons and the Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing , which was about two miles up the river from our house .
 So sometimes when I went up there with a lot of our folks , I would see a lot of the Shepherdsons riding their fine horses there .
 
.
One day Buck and I were deep in the woods hunting .
 We heard a horse coming as we were crossing the road .
 Buck said : 
.
Quick .
 Into the woods .
 
.
I don’t like the fact that you shot him from behind the bush .
 Why didn’t you step out into the road , my boy .
 
.
The Shepherdsons don’t do that , father .
 They always take any advantage they can get .
 
.
As soon as I could get Buck alone by the corn cribshuts used for storing and drying corncorn cribs under the trees , I said : 
.
Did you want to kill him , Buck .
 
.
You bet I did .
 
.
Him .
 He never did anything to me .
 
.
Well , why did you want to kill him , then .
 
.
No reason—just because of the feud .
 
.
What’s a feud .
 
.
I’ve never heard of it before—tell me about it .
 
.
Has this one been going on for a long time , Buck .
 
.
I would say so .
 It started around thirty years ago .
 There was a fight over something , and then a lawsuit to settle it .
 The suit went against one guy , so he went and shot the man that won the suit—which he had to do , of course .
 Any man would have done the same .
 
.
What was the fight about , Buck .
 Was it over land .
 
.
I suppose it was—I don’t know .
 
.
Well , who did the shooting .
 Was it a Grangerford or a Shepherdson .
 
.
Lord , how should I know .
 It was so long ago .
 
.
Doesn’t anyone know .
 
.
Oh sure , I’d guess pa knows , and some of the other old people .
 But they’ve probably forgotten what the fight was about in the first place .
 
.
Have a lot of people been killed , Buck .
 
.
Has anyone been killed this year , Buck .
 
.
It sounds to me like that old man was a coward , Buck .
 
.
I would say he WASN’T a coward .
 Not by a long shot .
 There isn’t a coward among those Shepherdsons—not one .
 And there aren’t any cowards among the Grangerfords either .
 Why , that old man fought for half an hour again three Grangerfords—and he came out the winner .
 They were all on horseback .
 He jumped off his horse and ducked behind a little pile of wood , keeping his horse in front of him to block the bullets .
 But the Grangerfords stayed on their horses , circling the old man and shooting at him , and the old man kept shooting back .
 He and his horse were both shot up when they got back home , but the Grangerfords had to be BROUGHT home—one of them was dead and another died the next day .
 No , sir—if you’re looking for cowards , don’t waste your time looking among the Shepherdsons .
 You won’t find them .
 
.
Master George , if you come down to the swamp , I’ll show a whole bunch ofwater moccasinspoisonous water snakes indigenous to the Southwater moccasins .
 
.
Why didn’t you tell my Jack to bring me here sooner .
 
.
WHAT raft , Jim .
 
.
Our old raft .
 
.
Are you telling me that our raft wasn’t smashed to pieces .
 
.
But how did you get the raft back again , Jim—did you catch it .
 
.
What’s going on .
 
.
He said : 
.
Don’t you know , Master George .
 
.
Buck left without waking me up .
 
.
Well , sure he did .
 They weren’t going to mix you up in this business .
 Master Buck loaded his gun and said he was going to kill a Shepherdson or die trying .
 Well , there will be plenty of them , I imagine , an you can bet he’ll kill one if he gets the chance .
 
.
I ran up the river road as fast as I could .
 Pretty soon I began to hear guns firing way off in the woods .
 When I came within sight of the log store and the woodpile where the steamboats land , I began to follow along the treeline and brush until I found a good spot .
 I was about to hide behind a four-foot high pile of boards that was a little in front of a cottonwood tree , but I decided to climb a tree instead .
 I climbed up into the forked branches to watch , and it was a lucky thing that I did .
 
.
There were four or five men galloping around on their horses in open space in front of the log store .
 They were swearing and yelling and trying to get at a couple of young guys who were hiding behind another woodpile near the steamboat landing .
 They couldn’t make it to the landing , though , because they were getting shot at every time they showed themselves on the river side of the woodpile .
 The two guys were squatting back to back behind the pile , so they could see in both directions .
 
.
The men galloped around some more , then rode away .
 As soon as they were out of sight I called down to Buck .
 He couldn’t see me , so he was awfully surprised—he didn’t know what to make of my voice coming out of the tree .
 Then he told me to keep a lookout and let him know when the men came back in sight .
 He said they were playing some trick and would be back soon .
 I wished I weren’t in that tree , but I couldn’t risk coming down .
 Buck began to cry and curse .
 He said that he and his cousin Joe—that was the other kid—would pay them back for what happened today .
 He said that his father and his two brothers had been killed as well as two or three Shepherdsons .
 He said the Shepherdsons had ambushed them .
 He said that he and his father and brothers should have waited for their relatives to come since the Shepherdsons were too strong for them .
 I asked what had happened to young Harney and Miss Sophia .
 He said they’d safely gotten across the river .
 I was glad to hear that , but Buck carried on about not having been able to kill Harney that day in the woods .
 I’d never heard anything like it .
 
.
I was so afraid to come down that I stayed in the tree until it began to get dark .
 Sometimes I would hear the sound of guns way off in the woods .
 Twice I saw little gangs of men with guns gallop past the log store , so I figured that the fighting was still going on .
 I was feeling pretty sad .
 I made up my mind that I would never go near that house again , because I figured that I was somehow to blame .
 I figured that piece of paper meant that Miss Sophia was supposed to meet Harney somewhere at half past two o’clock so that they could run off together .
 And I figured I ought to have told her father about the paper and the funny way she’d acted .
 Then maybe he would have locked her up and this awful mess wouldn’t have happened .
 
.
Good land .
 Is that you , kid .
 Don’t make any more noise .
 
.
I said : 
.
No—ghosts wouldn’t say , ‘Darn it .
 Darn this fog .
 ’
.
No , you don’t .
 I don’t hear any dogs or horses .
 You’ve got time to get through the bushes and up the creek a little ways .
 Then you can get in the water and wade down to me and climb in—that’ll throw the dogs off your scent .
 
.
What got you into trouble .
  the bald-headed guy asked the other guy .
 
.
I wouldn’t be against it .
 What line of work are you in .
 
.
I’ve worked a lot in the medical profession in my time .
 The laying on of handsreligious practice in which the minister or healer places his or her hands on the subject to drive away disease or evil spiritslaying on of hands to cure cancer , paralysis , and those kinds of things—that’s what I’m best at .
 And I’m a pretty good fortuneteller , when I’ve got a partner to help me find out all the facts first .
 Preaching is my main line of work , and I often work camp meetingsreligious services offered by traveling preacherscamp meetings and do missionary stuff .
 
.
No one said anything for a while .
 Then the younger man sighed and said : 
.
Too bad .
 
.
What’s too bad .
  asked the bald guy .
 
.
It’s too bad that I’ve been leading a life like this and to have degrade myself by keeping this kind of company .
  He began to wipe the corner of his eye with a rag .
 
.
Damn your poor broken heart ,  the bald guy said .
 Why are you crying to US about your poor broken heart .
 WE haven’t done anything to you .
 
.
Brought you down from what .
 Where were you brought down from .
 
.
Jim’s eyes bugged out of his head when he heard that .
 I imagine mine did too .
 Then the bald guy said : No .
 Really .
 
.
Jim felt an awful lot of pity for him , and so did I .
 We tried to comfort him , but he said it wasn’t much use—he couldn’t be comforted .
 He said that us acknowledging his true identity would do him more good than anything else , so we said we would , if he’d just tell us how to do so .
 He said we ought to bow when we spoke to him and say , Your Grace ,  My Lord ,  or Your Lordship .
  He also said he wouldn’t mind it if we simply called him Bridgewater ,  which , he said , was a title in and of itself and not just a name .
 One of us ought to wait on him at dinner , too , and do whatever he wanted .
 
.
No .
 
.
No , you aren’t .
 You aren’t the only person that’s been wrongfully dragged down from a high station .
 
.
Oh no .
 
.
No , you aren’t the only person who has a secret about his birth .
  Then , by golly , HE began to cry .
 
.
Wait a minute .
 What do you mean .
 
.
Bilgewater , can I trust you .
  asked the old man , still sobbing a little .
 
.
To the bitter end .
  The duke took the old man by the hand , squeezed it , and said , Tell me your secret .
 
.
Bilgewater , I am the late Dauphintitle of the crown prince in FranceDauphin .
 
.
You can bet Jim and I just stared this time .
 Then the duke said : 
.
You’re a… a what .
 
.
No .
 At your age .
 No .
 You mean you’re the late Charlemagnethe duke is mixing up his history by confusing Charlemagne with Louis XVII and by confusing the dates of Charlemane’s ruleCharlemagne .
 You must be at least six or seven hundred years old .
 
.
Trouble has done it , Bilgewater , trouble has done it .
 Trouble has brought gray hairs and premature baldness .
 Yes , gentlemen , the man you see before you , miserable and dressed in blue jeans , is the wandering , exiled , trampled on , suffering rightful king of France .
 
.
Jim and I were pretty glad to see that the duke took his hand , because it took away all the awkwardness .
 We felt pretty good about it , because it would have been miserable to have unfriendliness on the raft .
 More than anything else , you want everyone on a raft to be satisfied and to feel good about everyone else .
 
.
It didn’t take me long to figure out that these liars weren’t kings or dukes at all , but only low down con artists and frauds .
 But I didn’t say anything .
 I never let on that I knew .
 I just kept it to myself .
 That’s the best way , you see , when there aren’t any fights and you don’t get into any trouble .
 If they wanted us to call them kings and dukes , I wouldn’t object as long as they didn’t cause any trouble on the raft .
 And it wasn’t any use to tell Jim , so I didn’t .
 If I learned anything from pap , it was that the best way to get along with people like them is to let them have their way .
 
.
They asked us an awful lot of questions .
 They wanted to know why we were covered up the raft , and why we rested during the day instead of running—wait , was Jim a runaway n----- .
 I said : 
.
For goodness’s sake .
 Would a runaway n----- head SOUTH .
 
.
No , they said he wouldn’t .
 I had to find some way to explain all these things , so I said : 
.
The duke said : 
.
Leave me sit alone and figure out a way that we can travel during the day if we want to .
 I’ll think it over and come up with a plan .
 We’ll let it go for today , because , of course , we don’t want to pass by that town in the daylight—it might not be healthy for us .
 
.
I figure that the difference in our rank would have suggested to you that a bed made out of corn husks isn’t fit for me to sleep on .
 You can take the corn husk bed yourself , Your Grace .
 
.
For a minute , Jim and I were worried that there was going to be some serious trouble between them .
 We were really glad when the duke said : 
.
I had the middle watch , but I was pretty sleepy by that time , so Jim said he’d take the first half of it for me .
 He was really good about things like that .
 I crawled into the wigwam , but there wasn’t any room for me because the king and the duke had their legs sprawled .
 So I lay down outside—I didn’t mind the rain because it was warm , and the waves weren’t very large .
 They started getting bad again around two o’clock , though .
 Jim was going to call me , but he changed his mind after deciding they weren’t yet high enough to do any harm .
 He was mistaken about that , though , because pretty soon a huge wave came along all of a sudden and washed me overboard .
 Jim nearly died from laughter .
 He laughed more often than any n----- I’d ever seen .
 
.
I took the watch , and Jim laid down and started snoring .
 Pretty soon the storm let up for good .
 I woke him up when I spotted the first cabin light from the shore , and we found a place to hide the raft for the day .
 
.
Ah , but the histrionic muse is the best .
 Have you ever trod the boardsexpression meaning , acted in the theatertrod the boards , Royalty .
 
.
No ,  said the king .
 
.
Easily .
 
.
All right .
 I’m dying for a fresh new scheme anyway .
 Let’s get started right away .
 
.
There was a little one-horse town about three miles down around the bend in the river .
 After dinner , the duke said he’d figured out a way so that we could travel during the day without putting Jim in danger , and that he’d have to go to town to set it up .
 The king said he would go with him to scout out any good opportunities .
 We were out of coffee , so Jim said that I should go with them in the canoe and get some more .
 
.
The duke said he needed to find a printing office .
 We found a small one housed above a carpenter’s shop .
 Both the carpenter and the printer had gone to the meeting and left the doors unlocked .
 It was a dirty place with lots of junk lying around .
 There were ink marks and handbills showing pictures of horses and runaway n------ posted all over the walls .
 The duke removed his coat and said that he’d be okay , so the king and I headed for the camp meeting .
 
.
There were also much larger sheds where crowds of people gathered to hear the preaching .
 There were benches made from the outside of sawed logs—they had holes bored into the round side of the log to drive sticks in for the legs .
 The benches didn’t have any backs .
 The preachers stood on high platforms at one end of the sheds .
 The women wore sunbonnets , and some wore linsey-woolseycloth made of both linen and woollinsey-woolsey frock , while others had on ginghamcolored , often patterned fabricgingham frocks .
 A few of the young ones had calico frocks .
 Some of the young men were barefooted , and some of the children were naked except a tow-linencheaply woven fabric made out of scraps of yarntow-linen shirt .
 Some of the old women were knitting , and some of the young folk were secretly flirting with each other .
 
.
Oh .
 Come up here to the mourner’s bench .
 Come all of you , who are black with sin .
 AMEN .
  Come , all you who are sick and sore .
 AMEN .
  Come , all you who are lame and crippled and blind .
 AMEN .
  Come , all of you who are worn out and tired and suffering—come with your broken spirit .
 Come with your guilty heart .
 Come in your rags and sin and dirt .
 The waters that will clean you are free to you .
 The door of heaven stands open to you .
 Come in and be at peace .
 A-A-MEN .
 GLORY , GLORY HALLELUJAH .
 
.
Then he burst into tears , and so did everyone else .
 Then someone called out , Take up a collection for him , take up a collection .
  Half a dozen people offered to start one , but then someone cried out , HE should pass the hat around .
  Everyone agreed , including the preacher .
 
.
So the king went through the crowd with his hat , wiping his eyes and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being so kind to the poor pirates way out in the Indian Ocean .
 And every now and then , a really pretty girl would ask him , with tears running down her cheeks , if it would be all right if she kissed him so that he’d remember her .
 He always said yes , and some of them hugged and kissed him five or six times .
 He was invited to stay the whole week , and everyone wanted him to live in their house , saying it would be an honor to have him .
 But he said that he wouldn’t be able to stay , since this was the last day of the camp meeting .
 Besides , he said , he was in a hurry to get back to the Indian Ocean to get to work converting those pirates .
 
.
We all agreed that the duke was pretty smart , and that now we’d have no trouble traveling in the daytime .
 We figured we should travel quite a ways that night to put enough distance between us and the trouble that the duke’s printing scam would likely cause once people figured out they’d been cheated .
 Then we wouldn’t have to worry .
 
.
We laid low and kept quiet , and didn’t shove off until nearly ten o’clock .
 Then we slide out away from the town , and didn’t hang our lantern out until we were out of sight .
 
.
When Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning he said : 
.
Huck , do you suppose we’re going to run across any more kings on this trip .
 
.
I found out that Jim had been trying to get the king to speak in French so that he could hear what it sounded like .
 But the king had said he’d been in this country so long and he’d had so much trouble in his life that he’d forgotten it .
 
.
Next they pulled out a couple of long swords that the duke had made out of laths , and they began to practice the swordfight .
 The duke called himself Richard III the whole time .
 It was quite a fine sight to see the way they carried on and pranced around the raft .
 But after a while the king tripped and fell overboard , so after that they rested and talked about all kinds of adventures they’d had up and down the river in times past .
 
.
After dinner , the duke said : 
.
Well , Capet , we’ll want to make this a first class show , you know , so I guess we should add a bit more to it .
 We’ll want a little something to put on after the encores , anyway .
 
.
What are encores , Bilgewater .
 
.
The duke told him , then said : 
.
I’ll do the Highland fling or the sailor’s hornpipe dances for my encore , and you can… well , let me see… oh , I’ve got it .
 You can do Hamlet’s soliloquy .
 
.
Hamlet’s what .
 
.
So he went pacing back and forth , thinking and frowning deeply every now and then .
 Then he would raise his eyebrows , squeeze his hand on his forehead , stagger back , and kind of moan .
 Then he would sigh and pretend to cry a little .
 It was pretty impressive to see him .
 After a minute he got it .
 He told us to pay attention .
 Then he made a very noble face , put one leg forward , stretched his arm way up in the air , tilted his head back , and looked up into the sky .
 He began to cuss and swear and grit his teeth before finally starting the speech .
 The whole time he was speaking , he howled and flung his arms around and puffed his chest .
 He gave a performance that blew every other actor I’d ever seen out of the water .
 This was his speech—I learned it pretty easily while he was teaching it to the king : 
.
To be , or not to be .
 that is the bare bodkin That makes calamity of so long life .
 For who would fardels bear , till Birnam Wood do come to Dunsinane , But that the fear of something after death Murders the innocent sleep , Great nature's second course , And makes us rather sling the arrows of outrageous fortune Than fly to others that we know not of .
 There's the respect must give us pause : Wake Duncan with thy knocking .
 I would thou couldst .
 For who would bear the whips and scorns of time , The oppressor's wrong , the proud man's contumely , The law's delay , and the quietus which his pangs might take , In the dead waste and middle of the night , when churchyards yawn In customary suits of solemn black , But that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns , Breathes forth contagion on the world , And thus the native hue of resolution , like the poor cat i' the adage , Is sicklied o'er with care , And all the clouds that lowered o'er our housetops , With this regard their currents turn awry , And lose the name of action .
 'Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished .
 But soft you , the fair Ophelia : Ope not thy ponderous and marble jaws , But get thee to a nunnery—go .
 
.
Well , the old man liked the speech , and after a short while he had it memorized .
 It seemed like he was born to deliver it .
 He would get excited and had his hands going—it was wonderful they way he’d put so much into his performance .

After that , we wandered around town .
 The store and houses were all old , ramshackled buildings that hadn’t ever been painted .
 They were all built on stilts three or four feet off the ground so that they wouldn’t be damaged when the river flooded .
 The houses had little gardens around them , but nothing seemed to be growing in them except for jimpson weeds and sun flowers , piles of ash from old fires , worn out old boots and shoes , pieces of bottles , rags , and banged up tin pots and pans .
 The fences were made from different kinds of boards , all nailed on at different times .
 They leaned in all sorts of directions , and the gates only had leather hinges .
 Some of the fences had been whitewashed at some point , but the duke said it’d likely been done back during Columbus’s time .
 There were lots of pigs in the gardens , and people were driving them out .
 
.
Gimme some chewing tobacco , Hank .
 
.
Well , I DID pay you back some of it once .
 
.
Yes , you did—about six plugs of it .
 You borrowed store tobacco and paid me back in n------headtype of black chewing tobaccon------head .
 
.
Store tobacco is a flat black plug , but these fellows usually chew a kind made of twisted , natural tobacco leaves .
 When they borrow chewing tobacco , they usually don’t cut it off with a knife , but put the plug in between their teeth and gnaw at it until it breaks into two pieces .
 Then , sometimes the guy that lent the tobacco gets upset when it’s returned to him and says sarcastically : 
.
All the loiterers looked happy .
 I guess they were used to having some fun with Boggs .
 One of them said : 
.
I wonder what he’s going to kill this time .
 If he’d killed all the men he’s been saying he was going to kill for the last twenty years , then he’d have a pretty fiercesome reputation by now .
 
.
Boggs came galloping in on a horse , whooping and yelling like and Indian , crying out : 
.
Clear the road there .
 I’m on the warpath , and the price of coffins is going to go up when I start killing people .
 
.
He saw me , rode up to me , and said : 
.
Where’d you come from , boy .
 Are you prepared to die .
 
.
Then he rode on .
 I was scared , but a man said : 
.
He doesn’t mean anything—he’s always carrying on like that when he’s drunk .
 He’s he most easy going old fool in Arkansas .
 He never hurt anyone , drunk or sober .
 
.
Come out here , Sherburn .
 Come out and meet the man you’ve swindled .
 You’re the hound I’m after , and I’m going to have you too .
 
.
I’m tired of this , but I’ll put up with it until one o’clock .
 Until one o’clock , mind you—no longer than that .
 If you say anything against me after one o’clock , I’ll hunt you down wherever you are .
 
.
Go get his daughter .
 Quick , go get his daughter .
 Sometimes he’ll listen to her .
 If anyone can persuade him to stop , it’s her .
 
.
Someone ran off to get her .
 I walked down the street a ways and stopped .
 Boggs came back again in about five or ten minutes , but not on his horse .
 This time he was careening across the street towards me , hatless , with a friend on either side holding his arms and hurrying him away .
 He was quiet and looked uneasy .
 He wasn’t putting up a fight , but was hurrying along himself .
 Then someone called out : 
.
Boggs .
 
.
Colonel Sherburn tossed his pistol to the ground , turned around on his heels , and walked off .
 
.
Well , pretty soon someone said that Sherburn ought to be lynched .
 After another minute , everyone was saying it .
 Then they went off , angry and yelling and ripping down every clothesline they passed to hang him with .
 
.
Sherburn never said a word .
 He just stood there , looking down , slowly running his eyes over the crowd .
 The stillness was awfully creepy and uncomfortable .
 The people tried to meet his gaze , but they couldn’t .
 They dropped their eyes as if they were trying to hide something .
 Pretty soon , Sherburn let out a sort of laugh .
 It wasn’t a pleasant laugh , but the kind laugh that makes you feel as if you’d been eating bread that had sand in it .
 
.
Slowly and scornfully , he said : 
.
The idea of YOU lynching anybody—it’s amusing .
 The idea of you thinking that you had enough guts to lynch a man .
 You think you have what it takes simply because you’re brave enough to tar and feather poor , friendless outcast women who come through here .
 Does that make you think you have the stomach to lay your hands on a MAN .
 Why , as long as there’s daylight and you’re not creeping behind him , a MAN would be safe even if there were ten thousand of you .
 
.
So the juries always acquit .
 Then some MAN goes out into the night with a hundred masked cowards behind him and lynches the scoundrel .
 Your first mistake is that you didn’t bring a MAN with you .
 The second is that you didn’t come in the dark and bring your masks to hide behind .
 You brought PART of a man—Buck Harkness there—and if he hadn’t been there to get you all riled up , you would have just blown off a bunch of hot air .
 
.
That night we put on our OWN show , even though there was only about twelve people there—just enough to break even .
 Everyone laughed throughout the whole show , which made the duke mad .
 And the entire crowd left before the show was even over , except for one boy who’d fallen asleep .
 The duke said that these Arkansas lunkheads weren’t good enough for Shakespeare .
 He said he knew all about their type .
 He figured that what they wanted was low comedy—and maybe something even worse than that .
 So , next morning he took some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint and drew some new handbillsposters , usually ones that advertise a show or performancehandbills .
 Then he stuck them up all over the village .
 The handbills said : 
.
AT THE COURTHOUSE .
 FOR 3 NIGHTS ONLY .
 
.
The World Renowned Tragedians
.
DAVID GARRICK THE YOUNGER .
 
.
AND EDMUND KEAN THE ELDER .
 
.
Of the London and
.
Continental Theatres , 
.
In their Thrilling Tragedy of
.
THE KING’S CAMEL-LEOPARD , 
.
OR , THE ROYAL NOTHINGNESS .
 .
 .
 
.
Admission 50 cents .
 
.
LADIES AND CHILDREN NOT ADMITTED .
 
.
Twenty people yelled out : 
.
The duke answered yes .
 Then all hell broke loose .
 Everyone yelled out , Cheated .
  and got up angrily , headed for the stage and those tragedians .
 But a big , handsome looking man jumped up on a bench and shouted : 
.
The house was crammed again on the third night—and there weren’t any newcomers in the audience this time .
 Instead , the house was filled with people who’d been at the show the previous two nights .
 I stood by the duke at the door , and I saw that everyman who went in had bulges in his pockets or something stuffed up under his coat—and it wasn’t perfume or anything nice .
 I smelled rotten eggs and cabbages and stuff , and if I knew the signs of a dead cat—and I do—then there were sixty-four of them in the house that night .
 I shoved my way inside for a minute , but it was too risky for me—I couldn’t stand it .
 When the place couldn’t hold any more peole , the duke gave a guy a quarter and told him to take his post selling tickets at the door .
 Then he started for the stage door , and I went after him .
 The minute we turned the corner and were in the dark , he said : 
.
Now walk fast until you’re away from the houses , then run for the raft like the wind .
 
.
Well , how’d the scam pan out this time , duke .
  Apparently he hadn’t been uptown at all .
 
.
Those scoundrels took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in those three nights .
 I never saw money hauled in by the wagon load like that before .
 Pretty soon , when they were asleep and snoring , Jim said : 
.
Doesn’t it surprise you the way those kings behave , Huck .
 
.
No ,  I said .
 It doesn’t
.
Why not , Huck .
 
.
Is that so .
 
.
But this one does SMELL like a pile of garbage , Huck .
 
.
Well , they all do , Jim .
 We can’t change the way kings smell .
 History doesn’t talk about that anyway .
 
.
Now the duke , he’s not such a bad guy in some ways .
 
.
Yeah , the duke is different .
 But not that different .
 This one’s kind of a rough duke .
 When he gets drunk , no one would be able to tell the difference between him and a king .
 
.
Well , anyways , I’m not eager to have any more of them , Huck .
 This is all I can stand .
 
.
I feel that way too , Jim , but we’ve got them on our hands .
 We’ve got to remember what they are and cut them some slack .
 Sometimes I wish we found out about a country that’s run out of kings .
 
.
What was the use to tell Jim that these guys weren’t really a king and duke .
 It wouldn’t have done any good .
 Besides , it was just like I said—you couldn’t tell the difference between them and the real ones anyway .
 
.
‘Shut the door .
 ’
.
‘Don’t you hear me .
 Shut the door .
 ’
.
She just stood there the same way , sort of smiling .
 I was boiling angry .
 I said : 
.
‘I swear I’ll make you MIND me .
 ’
.
Sick Arab—but harmless when not going crazy .
 
.
For the steamboat .
 I’m going to New Orleans .
 
.
Get aboard ,  said the king .
 Hold on a minute , my servant will help you with those bags .
 Jump out and help the gentleman , Adolphus—by which he meant me , I realized .
 
.
Did anyone send word to them .
 
.
Oh yes , about a month or two ago when Peter first got sick .
 He said then that he felt like he wasn’t going to get well this time .
 You see , he was pretty old , and George’s girls were too young to be of any use as company for him , except for Mary Jane , the red-headed one .
 So he was kind of lonesome after George and his wife died , and he didn’t seem to care much to live anymore .
 He desperately wanted to see Harvey—and William too for that matter—because he was one of those people who couldn’t stand to write a will .
 He left a letter behind for Harvey .
 He said he’d told him in the letter where he’d hidden his money and how he wanted the rest of his property to be divided up so that George’s girls would be okay , because George hadn’t left them anything .
 That letter was all they could get him to write .
 
.
Why do you think Harvey hasn’t come .
 Where does he live .
 
.
Yes , but that’s only part of my trip .
 Next Wednesday , I’m boarding a ship for Rio de Janiero , where my Uncle lives .
 
.
Poor things .
 To be left alone like that in this cold world .
 
.
Well , they could be worse off .
 Old Peter had friends , and they won’t let anything bad happen to thode girls .
 There’s Hobson , the Baptist preacher , and Deacon Lot Hovey .
 Then there’s Ben Rucker and Abner Shackleford and Levi Bell , the lawyer .
 There’s also Dr .
 Robinson , plus all those men’s wives and the widow Bartley—well , there’s a lot of them .
 But those people are the ones that Peter was closest to and would write about sometimes in letters home .
 So Harvey will know where to look for friends when he gets here .
 
.
Why did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat .
 
.
Because she’s a big New Orleans boat , and I was afraid she might not stop in my small village .
 When they’re fully loaded , they won’t stop for anything .
 Boats from Cincinnati will , but this boat came from StLouis .
 
.
Was Peter Wilks well off .
 
.
Oh yes , pretty well off .
 He had houses and land , and people think he hid three or four thousand dollars in cash somewhere .
 
.
When did you say he died .
 
.
Is it likely that the funeral will be held tomorrow .
 
.
Yes , around the middle of the day .
 
.
Well , it’s terribly sad .
 But we’ve all got to die sometime .
 So what we should all do is to be prepared .
 Then we’ll be all right .
 
.
Yes sir , that’s the best way .
 My mother used to always say that .
 
.
Now hustle back right away and bring the duke here with the new carpetbags .
 If he’s gone over to the other side of the river , go and get him .
 Tell him to get himself over here no matter what he’s doing .
 Go along now .
 
.
How are you at playing deaf and mute , Bilgewater .
 
.
The duke told the king to just leave it to him .
 He said he’d played a deaf and mute person before .
 Then they waited for a steamboat .
 
.
A couple of little boats came along around the middle of the afternoon , but they didn’t come from far enough up the river .
 At last , a big one came along , and they called out to it .
 She sent out her yawla small sailboat with two mastsyawl , and we went aboard .
 The boat was from Cincinnati , and when the crew found out we only wanted to go four or five miles , they were really angry .
 They cussed us out and said they wouldn’t take us where we wanted .
 But the king was calm , and said : 
.
If we gentlemen can afford to pay a dollar a mile on board the yawl , then a steamboat can afford to carry us , can’t it .
 
.
Can any of you gentlement tell me where MrPeter Wilks lives .
  All the men glanced at one another and nodded their heads as if to say , What did I tell you .
  Then one of them said , softly and gently : 
.
I’m sorry , sir , but the best we can do is tell you where he DID live until yesterday evening .
 
.
Is it THEM .
 
.
And then someone running along with a bunch of other people would answer back : 
.
You bet it is .
 
.
Then the king began to start talking again .
 He said how he and his nieces would be glad if a few of the deceased’s family and most important friends would have supper here with them this evening and help set everything up with the ashes of the deceased .
 He said that if his poor dead brother lying over there could speak he’d know who he’d name because they would be the names of those who were very dear to him and whom he mentioned often in his letters .
 And so the king said he’d name those same people : Rev .
 MrHobson , Deacon Lot Hovey , MrBen Rucker , Abner Shackleford , Levi Bell , Dr .
 Robinson , and all their wives , and the widow Bartley .
 
.
Oh have you ever seen anything better than THIS .
 I bet not .
 Why , Billy , it beats the Nonesuch scam , DOESN’T it .
 
.
The duke agreed .
 They pawed the gold coins and sifted through them with their fingers and let them jingle on the floor .
 Then the king said : 
.
It’s no use talking .
 Being brothers to a dead rich man and representatives of heirs to a fortune built on furs that have nothing left of their family line except for you and me , Bilge .
 We’ve been rewarded for trusting in Providence .
 It’s the best way , in the long run .
 I’ve tried all the scams out there , and there isn’t one better than this .
 
.
Most people would have been satisfied with this pile of gold and trusted that it was all there .
 But these two had to count it .
 So they counted it and it came out four hundred and fifteen dollars short .
 The king said : 
.
Darn him , I wonder what he did with that four hundred and fifteen dollars .
 
.
They thought about that for a while , and ransacked the cellar looking for it .
 Then the duke said : 
.
It nearly made them broke , but they were able to come up with the difference to make an even six thousand .
 
.
When we got back upstairs , everyone gathered around the table and the king counted and stacked it all up into twenty elegant little piles with three hundred dollars per pile .
 Everyone looked hungrily at it all and licked their lips .
 Then they shoveled it back into the bag , and I saw that the king was buffing his chest in preparation for another speech .
 He said : 
.
You DEAR good souls .
 How LOVELY .
 How CAN you be so kind .
 
.
He kept blathering on , enjoying the sound of his own voice , bringing up the funeral orgies every now and then until the duke couldn’t stand it any more .
 He wrote , It’s OBSEQUIES , not orgies , you old fool on a little piece of scrap paper , folded it up , and went goo-gooing through the crowd .
 He reached over people’s heads to hand it to the king , who read it , put it in his pocket , and said : 
.
Then he started talking again , perfectly calm , and he would go back to the funeral orgies every now and then , just as he’d done before .
 When he said it incorrectly the third time , he added : 
.
The king smiled eagerly , shoved out his hand , and said : 
.
The crowd sure reacted to that .
 Everyone crowded around the doctor and tried to quiet him down and explain to him how Harvey had proved in about forty different ways that he WAS Harvey .
 They said he knew everyone by name , even the names of the dogs , and they begged and BEGGED the doctor not to hurt Harvey’s feelings or those of the poor girls and on and on .
 But it wasn’t any use .
 The doctor continued raging , saying that any man who pretended to be an Englishman but couldn’t imitate the language any better than that had to be a fraud and a liar .
 The poor girls were hanging on to the king and crying .
 The doctor turned to THEM suddenly and said : 
.
All right .
 I wash MY hands of this matter .
 But I warn you all that there’s going to come a time when you’re going to feel sick every time you remember this day .
  Then he left .
 
.
All right , doctor ,  said the king , kind of mocking him .
 We’ll try and get them to send for you ,  which made everyone laugh .
 They said he got him good .
 
.
When the meal was done , me and Joanna , the harelipped girl , had ate leftovers in the kitchen while the others helped the n------ clean up .
 The harelipped girl started asking me about England , and I’ll admit it felt like I was walking on some pretty thin ice sometimes .
 She said : 
.
Did you ever see the king .
 
.
Who .
 William IV .
 Sure I have—he goes to our church .
  I knew that he’d died years ago , but I never let on that I knew .
 So when I said that he goes to our church , she said : 
.
Yes , regularly .
 His pew is right across from ours—on the other side of the pulpit .
 
.
I thought he lived in London .
 
.
Well , he does .
 Where else WOULD he live .
 
.
But I thought YOU lived in Sheffield .
 
.
I saw that I was trapped .
 I had to pretend I was choking on a chicken bone to stall for time so I could think of a way out .
 Then I said : 
.
I mean , he goes to our church regularly when he’s in Sheffield .
 That’s only in the summer time , when he goes there to take sea baths .
 
.
Well , who said it was .
 
.
You did .
 
.
I DIDN’T either .
 
.
You did .
 
.
I didn’t .
 
.
You did .
 
.
I never said anything like that .
 
.
Well , what DID you say , then .
 
.
I said he comes to take sea BATHS—that’s what I said .
 
.
Well , then how is he supposed to take a sea bath if it isn’t on the sea .
 
.
Look here ,  I said .
 Have you ever seen Congress watersaltwater from the Congress spring in New YorkCongress water .
 
.
Yes .
 
.
Well , did you have to Congress to get it .
 
.
Well , no .
 
.
Well , neither does William IV have to go to the sea to get a sea bath .
 
.
How does he get it then .
 
.
Oh , I get it .
 You could have said that in the first place and saved time .
 
.
Do you go to church , too .
 
.
Yes—regularly .
 
.
Where do you sit .
 
.
Why , in our pew , of course .
 
.
WHOSE pew .
 
.
HIS .
 What does HE want with a pew .
 
.
He wants to sit in it .
 What do you THINK he’d want it for .
 
.
Well , I thought he’d be in the pulpit .
 
.
Darn him , I’d forgotten he was a preacher .
 I saw that I was in a fix again , so I pretended to choke on another chicken bone and took another drink .
 Then I said : 
.
Darn it , do you think there’s only one preacher for each church .
 
.
Why would they want more than one .
 
.
What .
 To preach of for a king .
 I never saw such a girl as you .
 They don’t have any fewer than seventeen preachers .
 
.
Seventeen .
 My word .
 Why , I wouldn’t be able to sit there and listen to them all , even if it did mean I couldn’t go to heaven .
 It must take them a whole week to finish the service .
 
.
Shucks , they don’t ALL preach on the same day—only one of them does .
 
.
Well , then , what do the rest of them do .
 
.
Oh , not much .
 They sit around , pass the collection plate , that kind of stuff .
 But usually they don’t do anything .
 
.
Well then what are they there FOR .
 
.
Why , they’re there for STYLE .
 Don’t you know anything .
 
.
Well , I don’t WANT anything to do with such foolishness as that .
 How are servants treated in England .
 Do they treat them better than we treat our n------ .
 
.
NO .
 A servant isn’t anybody there .
 They treat them worse than dogs .
 
.
Listen to you .
 Anyone could tell YOU haven’t ever been to England just by the way you talk .
 Why , Hare—Joanna—the servants there don’t get a holiday all year .
 They never go to the circus , or the theater , no n----- shows , not anywhere .
 
.
Not even church .
 
.
Not even church .
 
.
But YOU always go to church .
 
.
Honestly now—have you been telling me a lot of lies .
 
.
Honestly , I haven’t .
 
.
None at all .
 
.
None at all .
 There wasn’t a lie in anything of it ,  I said .
 
.
Put your hand on this book and swear .
 
.
I saw that it wasn’t anything but a dictionary , so I put my hand on it and swore that I was telling the truth .
 She look a little more satisfied and said : 
.
Well then , I believe some of it .
 But I really don’t believe all of it .
 
.
What don’t you believe , Jo .
  asked Mary Jane as she stepped in with Susan behind her .
 It isn’t right or kind of you to talk like that to him , especially since he’s a stranger and so far from his people .
 How would you like to be treated that way .
 
.
You always do that , Maim—always sailing in to help someone before they’re hurt .
 I haven’t done anything to him .
 He’s been exaggerating , I think , and I said I wouldn’t believe all of what he said .
 And that’s all I said .
 I figure he can tolerate a little thing like that , can’t he .
 
.
It doesn’t make any different what he SAID—that isn’t the point .
 The point is for you to treat him KINDLY and to not say things that remind him that he isn’t in his own ountry and among his own people .
 
.
I thought to myself , THIS is the girl that I’m letting that old reptile rob .
 
.
So I thought to myself , this is ANOTHER girl that I’m letting him rob .
 
.
All right , then ,  said Mary Jane and Susan .
 Just ask him for forgiveness .
 
.
So , I thought to myself , I’ll go and search those rooms .
 The hall upstairs was dark , but I found the duke’s room and started groping around in there with with my hands .
 Then I figured that it wasn’t the king’s style to let anyone else take care of that money .
 So I went to his room and began to poke around in there .
 I couldn’t see anything without a candle , though , and it was definitely too risky to light one .
 I settled for another option—wait for them to show up and eavesdrop .
 Just then I heard their footsteps .
 I was going to slide under the bed , but when I reached out for it , I found it wasn’t where I thought it would be .
 Instead , I touched the curtain that hid Mary Jane’s frocks , so I jumped behind it , snuggled in amongst the gowns , and stood perfectly still .
 
.
Well , what is it .
 Keep this pretty short , because it’s better for us to be down there crying and mourning , rather than up here giving them a chance to talk about us .
 
.
What’s your idea , duke .
 
.
I’m thinking we better get out of here before three in the morning , and run to the river with what we’ve already gotten out of them .
 Especially since we got it so easily—it was GIVEN back to us , thrown at our heads you could say , even though we’d planned to steal it back .
 I’m for calling it quits and taking off .
 
.
What .
 And not sell the rest of the property .
 March off like a bunch of fools and leave eight or nine thousand dollars worth of property lying around just begging to be scooped up .
 It’s all good , salable stuff , too .
 
.
Well , the king talked and talked , and the duke finally gave in .
 He said all right , but that he believed it was foolish to stay , especially with the doctoring looming over them .
 But the king said : 
.
Curse the doctor .
 What do you care about HIM for .
 Didn’t we get all the fools in town on our side .
 And isn’t that a big enough majority in any town .
 
.
So they got ready to go downstairs again .
 The duke said : 
.
I don’t think we put that money in a good enough place .
 
.
Why .
 
.
Because Mary Jane will be in mourning from this point on .
 First , you know the n----- that cleans up these rooms will be told to box up these clothes and put them away .
 And do you think a n----- can run across money and not take some of it .
 
.
But I knew better .
 I had the bag out of there before they were halfway down the stairs .
 I groped along up the stairs to my nook in the attic , and hid the money there until I could get a chance to find a better hiding place .
 I figured I’d better hide it somewhere outside the house , because if they’d ransack the house if they realized it was missing—I knew that for sure .
 Then I went to bed with all my clothes still on .
 But I couldn’t have gotten to sleep if I wanted to .
 I was so anxious to get through with this business .
 Pretty soon I heard the king and the duke come upstairs , so I rolled off my pallet and laid with my chin at the top of my ladder , waiting to see if anything was going to happen .
 But nothing did .
 
.
So I waited until all the sounds of the night had stopped , but before the sounds of the early morning had begun .
 Then I slipped down the ladder .
 
.
When I went downstairs in the morning , the parlor was shut up and the sentries were gone .
 There wasn’t anyone around except for the family , the widow Bartley , our group .
 I watched their faces to see if anything unsual was going on , but I couldn’t tell .
 
.
They buried him , and we went back home .
 I started watching everyone’s face again , because I just couldn’t help it , and I couldn’t relax .
 Nothing more came of it , though—the faces didn’t tell me anything .
 
.
Well , darned it if the king didn’t prepare to auction the house and the n------ and all the property just two days after the funeral .
 Anybody could buy anything from him privately beforehand if they wanted to .
 
.
The sale caused major controversy in town and prompted many people to put their feet down in protest because it was so scandalous to separate the mother and children that way .
 It hurt the reputation of the king and the duke , but the king played along , despite the duke’s protests .
 You could tell the duke was getting pretty uneasy .
 
.
Were you in my room the night before last .
 
.
No , your majesty ,  which is what I always called him when no one except the people in our little group were around .
 
.
Were you in there yesterday , er , I mean , last night .
 
.
No , your majesty .
 
.
Be honest now—don’t lie .
 
.
The duke said : 
.
Have you seen anyone else go in there .
 
.
Stop and think .
 
.
I thought about it awhile , and saw the opportunity I was looking for .
 I said : 
.
Well , I’ve seen the n------ go in there several times .
 
.
A-ha .
 When was that .
 
.
Well , go on , go on .
 What did they do .
 How were they acting .
 
.
They weren’t doing anything .
 And they weren’t acting strangely as far as I could tell .
 They tiptoed away .
 It looked to me as if they’d gone in to clean up your majesty’s room , thinking you were awake , but slipped quietly when they found you still in bed .
 They didn’t want to wake you up and get in any trouble .
 
.
I deposited it in the bank .
 Where else would it be .
 
.
Well , at least we have that , thank goodness .
 
.
Rather timidly , I said : 
.
Did something bad happen .
 
.
The king whirled around to look at me and snarled : 
.
As they were starting down the ladder the duke chuckled again and said : 
.
Quick sales AND small profits .
 Oh yes , it’s a good business .
 
.
The king snarled back : 
.
I thought I was doing the best thing for us by selling them so quickly .
 If it turns out we didn’t make much money , is it any more my fault than yours .
 
.
Well , they’d still be in this house and we wouldn’t if SOMEONE had listened to my advice earlier .
 
.
Pretty soon it was time to get up .
 I went down the ladder and headed downstairs , but as I was passing by I saw that the door to the girls’ room was open .
 I saw Mary Jane inside sitting by her old hair trunk , which was open .
 She’d been packing things in it and getting ready to go to England .
 She had stopped , though , and had a folded gown in her lap and was crying with her face in her hands .
 I felt awful to see it—anyone would , of course .
 I went in there and said : 
.
Miss Mary Jane , you can’t stand to see people in trouble , and I usually can’t either .
 Tell me about it .
 
.
Miss Mary Jane , is there any place out of town a little ways where you could go and stay for three or four days .
 
.
Never mind why just yet .
 If I tell you how I know the n------ will see each other again—right here in this house—in less than two weeks and PROVE it , will you go to MrLothrop’s and stay four days .
 
.
Then I came back and sat down again and said : 
.
I said : 
.
Miss Mary Jane , I’ll tell you what we’ll do , and you won’t have to stay at MrLothrop’s so long either .
 How far is it .
 
.
A little under four miles away , just out in the countryside .
 
.
Stand by you .
 Yes , I will .
 They won’t touch a hair of your head .
  she said , and I saw her nostrils flare and her eyes snap when she said it too .
 
.
Why .
 
.
Why do you think I wanted you to go at all , Miss Mary .
 
.
Why , because you’re not one of those poker-faced people .
 Your face is just like a book , and anyone would be able to read your face and see that something was wrong .
 Do you think you’d be able to face your uncles when they come and kiss you good morning and never… .
 
.
Okay then , I won’t say that .
  I could tell HER that—what she didn’t know wouldn’t hurt her .
 It was just a little lie and would’t cause any harm .
 It’s little things like that that calm people down the most .
 It would make Mary Jane comfortable , and it wouldn’t make any difference .
 Then I said , There’s one more thing—that bag of money .
 
.
Well , they’ve got that .
 It makes me feel pretty silly to think HOW they got it too .
 
.
No , you’re wrong there .
 They don’t have it .
 
.
Oh , stop blaming yourself—it’s not good for you , and I won’t allow it .
 Besides , you couldn’t help it—it wasn’t your fault .
 Where did you hide it .
 
.
If you don’t mind , I’d rather NOT tell you where I put it , Miss Mary Jane .
 But I’ll write where I put it on a piece of paper , and you can read it when you’re on the road to MrLothrop’s if you want to .
 Do you think that will do .
 
.
Oh , yes .
 
.
So I wrote down , I put it in the coffin .
 It was in there when you were crying over it in the middle of the night .
 I was behind the door , and I felt very sorry for you , Miss Mary Jane .
 
.
It made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by herself that night and to think of those devils lying in bed right under her own roof , cheating her and robbing her .
 When I folded the paper and gave it to her , I saw that her eyes were starting to water too .
 She shook me hard by the hand and said : 
.
She’d pray for me .
 I’m sure if she knew me better she would have settled on something a bit easier considering how much praying for I needed .
 But I bet she prayed for me anyway—she was just that kind hearted .
 She’d pray for Judas if she got it in her head—she wasn’t the type to go back on her word , I figure .
 You can say what you want , but in my opinion she had a lot of guts—more guts than any girl I’d ever seen .
 That sounds like flattery , but I’m not trying to flatter her .
 And when it comes to beauty—goodness .
 She’s more beautiful than anyone else .
 I haven’t seen her since I let her walk out that door .
 Nope , haven’t seen her since , but I’ve probably thought of her a million times and remembered her saying she’d pray for me .
 If I ever thought it’d do any good for me to pray for HER , I would die trying .
 
.
What’s the name of those people over on the other side of the river that you all go and visit sometimes .
 
.
The said : 
.
That’s the name ,  I said .
 I must have forgotten it .
 Well , Miss Mary Jane told me to tell you she had to leave in an awful hurry to go over there—one of them is sick .
 
.
Which one .
 
.
Land’s sakes alives , I hope it isn’t HANNAH .
 
.
I’m sorry to say it ,  I said , but it was Hannah .
 
.
Bad doesn’t do it justice .
 They sat up with her all night , Miss Mary Jane said , and they don’t think she’ll live many more hours .
 
.
Just think of that .
 What’s the matter with her .
 
.
I couldn’t think of anything appropriate right off the bat , so I said : 
.
Mumps .
 
.
Mumps , my left foot .
 They don’t sit up all night with people who have the mumps .
 
.
Oh , they don’t .
 You better bet they do with THESE mumps .
 These mumps are different .
 It’s a new kind , Miss Mary Jane said .
 
.
How so .
 
.
Because it’s mixed up with other diseases .
 
.
What other things .
 
.
Well , measles and whooping coughdisease that causes infection of the lungswhooping cough and erysipelasskin infection that causes a red rasherysipelas and consumptiontuberculosisconsumption and yellow jaundiceyellowing of the skin and eyesyellow jaundice and brain feverencephalitis , or inflammation of brain tissuebrain fever and I don’t know what all else .
 
.
My word .
 And they call that the MUMPS .
 
.
That’s what Miss Mary Jane said .
 
.
Well , why in the world do they call it the MUMPS .
 
.
Well , because it IS the mumps .
 That’s how it all starts .
 
.
Well , why wouldn’t you tell him .
 
.
Just think a minute , and maybe you’ll understand .
 Haven’t your uncles said they want to get along home to England as fast as they can .
 And do you think they’d be mean enough to go off and leave you to follow them on that journey all by yourself .
 You KNOW they’ll wait for you .
 So far , so good .
 Your Uncle Harvey’s a preacher , isn’t her .
 Well then , is a PREACHER going to lie to a steamboat clerk .
 Is he going to lie to a SHIP CLERK so they’d let Miss Mary Jane go aboard .
 You know he wouldn’t .
 So what WILL he do instead .
 Why , he’ll say , ‘It’s such a pity , but they’ll just have to get on at church without me because my neice has been exposed to the dreadful pluribus unumLatin words for many and one .
 Huck uses these words incorrectlypluribus unum mumps .
 It’s my bound duty to sit down here and wait the three months it’ll take to show if she’s got it .
 ’ But never mind—if you think it’s best to tell your Uncle Harvey… .
 
.
Shoot , and have to stick around here waiting to see if Mary Jane’s caught it or not when we could all be in England having fun .
 You talk like an idiot .
 
.
Well , anyways , maybe you’d better tell some of the neighbors .
 
.
Why , you must mean the Apthorps , don’t you .
 
.
All right ,  they said , and they left to wait for their uncles so that they could give them love and kisses and the message .
 
.
In walked a very nice looking old gentleman , as well as a nice looking younger one , who had his right arm in a sling .
 And , my goodness , the people yelled and laughed for a while .
 I didn’t see what was so funny about it all , and I figured the king and duke probably didn’t either .
 I figured they would turn pale , but no , they DIDN’T turn pale .
 The duke never let on that he suspected something was up .
 Instead , he just went on googling out buttermilk .
 As for the king , he just kept on looking sorrowfully down at the newcomers , like it caused his heart pain to think there could be frauds and rascals like that in the world .
 Oh , he did an admirable job .
 Lots of the most important people in town gathered around the king to show him that they were on his side .
 The old gentleman that had just arrived looked like he was going to die of confusion .
 Eventually he began to speak , and I saw right away that he SOUNDED like an Englishman .
 He didn’t sound like the king , even though the king was good at imitating an English accent .
 I don’t remember the exact words the old gentleman said , nor can I imitate him , but he turned around to the crowd and said something like : 
.
So he and the new mute started off for the hotel .
 The king laughed and managed to say : 
.
Hey , look here .
 If you are Harvey Wilks , then when did you come to this town .
 
.
The day before the funeral , friend ,  said the king .
 
.
But what time of day .
 
.
In the evening—about an hour or two before sundown .
 
.
HOW did you come .
 
.
I came down on the Steamboat Susan Powell from Cincinnati .
 
.
I wasn’t up at the point in the morning .
 
.
You’re lying .
 
.
Several people in the crowd interrupted and begged him not to talk that way to an old man and a preacher .
 
.
Preacher , my butt—he’s a fraud and a liar .
 He was up at the point in the morning .
 I live up there , don’t I .
 Well , I was up there , and so was he .
 I saw him up there .
 He came in a canoe along with Tim Collins and a boy .
 
.
The doctor then said : 
.
Would you be able to recognize the boy if you saw him again , Hines .
 
.
I suppose I probably would , but I’m not sure .
 Why—there is over there right now .
 I recognize him easily .
 
.
He was pointing at me .
 The doctor said : 
.
Neighbors , I don’t know whether the new pair of gentleman are frauds or not .
 But if THESE two aren’t frauds , then I’m an idiot .
 I think it’s our duty to see that they don’t get away from here until we’ve investigated a bit more .
 Come along , Hines .
 Everyone else , come along .
 We’ll take these fellows to the tavern and put them face to face with the other gentlemen , and I figure we’ll discover SOMETHING before we’re finished .
 
.
Everyone went nuts with excitement , with the exception of maybe the king’s friends .
 It was almost sundown when we all headed out to the tavern .
 The doctor led me by the hand .
 He was very nice and everything—but he never let go of my hand .
 
.
Gentlemen , I wish that money were there , because I don’t want to do anything except be open and fair about this miserable business .
 Unfortunately , the money isn’t there , though .
 You can send for it and see if you want .
 
.
Where is it then .
 
.
Are YOU English too .
 
.
I said that I was .
 He and some others laughed and said , BS .
 
.
Sit down , my boy .
 I wouldn’t strain myself if I were you .
 I suppose you’re not used to lying—it doesn’t seem to come easily to you .
 You’re pretty bad at it .
 You need some practice .
 
.
I didn’t care much for what he intended to be a compliment , but I was glad to be off the hook .
 
.
The doctor started to say something , then turned and said : 
.
He and the lawyer shook hands , and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased .
 They talked for a little bit , then stepped to one side and spoke in lower tones until at last the lawyer spoke up and said : 
.
That’ll do .
 I’ll take the order and send it along with your brother’s , and they’ll know it’s all right .
 
.
If you and your brother would please write a sentence or two and then sign you names .
 
.
The old gentleman wrote , but no one could read it .
 The lawyer looked really astonished and said : 
.
The new old gentleman said : 
.
If you please , let me explain .
 No one can read my handwriting except for my brother here , so he copies for me .
 It’s HIS handwriting you’ve got in those letters , not mine .
 
.
Well then .
  said the lawyer .
 This IS a strange situation .
 I’ve got some of William’s letter’s too , so if you’ll get him to write a sentence or two , then we can com—
.
He CAN’T write with his left hand ,  said the old gentleman .
 If he could use his right hand , you would see that he wrote his own letters and mine , too .
 Look at both , please—they were written by the same person .
 
.
The lawyer did so , then said : 
.
I believe you’re right—and if not , then there’s a much stronger resemblance in the handwriting of the two letters than I noticed before .
 Well , well , well .
 I thought we were on the right track and headed toward a solution , but I guess not .
 But I guess we proved one thing—that THESE two aren’t the Wilks brothers ,  he said , nodding his head toward the king and duke .
 
.
Then the old man turned toward the king and said : 
.
Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his chest .
 
.
Hmph .
 That’s a VERY tough question , isn’t it .
 Yes , sir , I can tell you what’s tattoed on his chest .
 It’s just a small thin blue arrow , that’s what it is .
 And if you don’t look closely , you can’t see it .
 NOW what do you have to say , hm .
 
.
Well , I never saw a man with so much nerve .
 
.
Both of them spoke up and said : 
.
We didn’t see a mark like that .
 
.
Both of them spoke up again : 
.
No , we didn’t .
 We didn’t see any marks at all .
 
.
Well , that got everyone talking , and people called out : 
.
That got everyone’s attention .
 
.
Hooray .
  everyone shouted , and people started heading out immediately .
 But the lawyer and doctor called to everyone : 
.
Hold on , hold on .
 Grab these four men and the boy , and bring them along too .
 
.
We’ll do it .
  they all shouted .
 And if we don’t find those marks , we’ll hang the whole bunch .
 
.
As I passed our house , I wished I hadn’t sent Mary Jane out of town .
 If she was here , I could have winked at her , and she would have come to save me by telling on these deadbeats .
 
.
We went down along the river road in a swarm , carrying on like wild animals .
 The fact that it was getting darker and the wind was blowing and lightning starting to strike made it even scarier .
 This was the most trouble and most danger I’d ever been in , and I was kind of stunned .
 Everything was unfolding differently than the way I’d planned .
 Instead of being able to do things at my own pace and having fun watching the king and duke get in trouble and having Mary Jane save me and set me free when things got tight , there was nothing between me and sudden death except those tattoo marks .
 If they didn’t find them… .
 
.
I couldn’t bear to think about it .
 And yet , somehow I couldn’t think about anything else .
 It got darker and darker , and it was the perfect time of night to give everyone the slip , but the big husky guy—Hines—had me by the wrist .
 I might as well have tried to give Goliath the slip .
 He was so excited that he dragged me along , and I had to run to keep up with him .
 
.
By devil , here’s the bag of gold on his breast .
 
.
I was alone on the road—well , except for the darkness , the flashes of lightening , the pelting rain , the thrashing wind , and the ear-splitting thunder .
 I flew along that road , and as sure as you were born , I ran fast .
 
.
Come out here , Jim , and set the raft loose .
 Good gracious , we’re rid of them .
 
.
In two second , we were away and gliding down the river .
 It DID feel so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river with no one to bother us .
 I had to pace around a bit and jump and crack my joints a few times—I couldn’t help it .
 But after the third time I did this , I noticed a sound that I knew all too well .
 I held my breath and listened and waited , and sure enough—when the next flash of lightning lit up the water , there they were , paddling their skiff furiously and flying over the water .
 It was the king and duke .
 
.
I collapsed onto the planks of the raft and gave up .
 It was all I could do to keep from crying .
 
.
Trying to run away from us , were you , kid .
 Tired of our company , huh .
 
.
I said : 
.
Well then tell us what you were trying to do , or I’ll shake you inside out .
 
.
Jim said it was true .
 The king told him to shut up , then said : Oh sure , THAT’S a likely story .
  He shook me again and said he should go ahead and drown me .
 But the duke said : 
.
Let go of the boy , you old idiot .
 Would YOU have done any different .
 Did you ask around for HIM when you escaped .
 I don’t remember you doing so .
 
.
So the king let go of me and began to swear at that town and everyone in it .
 But the duke said : 
.
You better swear at yourself too , because you’re the one that deserves the most blame .
 Since the beginning , you haven’t done one sensible thing , except for coming up with that slick imaginary blue arrow mark .
 That WAS smart—it was pretty great , actually , and was the thing that saved us .
 If it hadn’t been for that , they would have put us in jail until that Englishman’s bags arrived .
 And then they would have put us in the penitentiary for sure .
 Your little trick sent them to the graveyard , though , and the gold helped us out even more .
 If those excited fools hadn’t let go of us and rushed to get a look , we would have been sleeping in our neckties tonight , and we would be wearing them much longer than we’d ever need to .
 
.
They stood there a minute thinking .
 Then the king absent-mindedly said : 
.
Huh .
 And we thought the N------ had stolen it .
 
.
That made me squirm .
 
.
About half a minute later the king drawled : 
.
At least , I thought they did .
 
.
In the same tone , the duke said : 
.
Oh , I did .
 
.
The king ruffled up a bit and said : 
.
The duke said briskly : 
.
If you’re going to put it that way , let me ask you : What were YOU getting at .
 
.
The duke bristled and said : 
.
Will you forget about all this nonsense .
 Do you think I’m an idiot .
 Don’t you think I know who hid that money in the coffin .
 
.
YES , sir .
 I know you DO know , because you did it yourself .
 
.
Liar .
  the duke said as he lunged for the king .
 The king cried : 
.
Take your hands off me .
 Let go of my throat .
 I take it all back .
 
.
The duke said : 
.
Well , just admit that you DID hide that money in the coffin with the intention of leaving me one of these days and coming back to dig it up and keep to yourself .
 
.
Well , then I believe you .
 But answer just one more question for me .
 Now don’t get mad , but weren’t you planning to the steal the money and hide it .
 
.
The duke didn’t say anything for a bit .
 Then he said : 
.
The king sputtered a bit , then gasped : 
.
Enough .
 I confess .
 
.
Still sniffling , the king said rather timidly : 
.
Why , duke , it was you that suggested making up the deficit .
 It wasn’t me .
 
.
We didn’t stop at any town for several days—we just kept floating down the river .
 We were getting further south now and the weather was warming .
 We were a pretty long way from home .
 We started to come across trees with Spanish moss hanging down from the limbs like long , gray beards .
 It was the first time I’d ever seen it growing , and it made the woods look solemn and dismal .
 The frauds figured that they were out of danger now , and they began to scam the people in the local villages again .
 
.
Let’s get going , Jim .
 We’re all clear now .
 
.
Yes .
 
.
Where .
  I asked .
 
.
Down by Silas Phelps’s place , about two miles down the river .
 He’s a runaway n----- , and they’ve captured him .
 Were you looking for him .
 
.
Well ,  he said , you don’t need to be afraid any more , because they’ve got him .
 He’d run away from some place south of here .
 
.
It’s a good thing they caught him .
 
.
I WOULD SAY so .
 There’s a two hundred dollar reward out for him .
 It’s like picking up money off the street .
 
.
Me too ,  I said .
 But maybe he didn’t even deserve the forty dollars , if he was willing to settle for so little money .
 There’s something that doesn’t seem right about it .
 
.
HUCK FINN .
 
.
Those were awful thoughts and awful words , but that’s what I said .
 And I didn’t take them back , either , and I never had any more thoughts about reforming .
 I shoved the whole thing out of my mind and said I’d go back to being wicked again .
 It was what I’d been brought up to do and what I was good at—I wasn’t good at being good .
 For starters , I’d start working on how to steal Jim out of slavery again .
 And if I could think of doing anything worse than that , then I’d do that too .
 If I was going to be bad from now on , then I might as well do it right .
 
.
HEL-LO .
 Where’d you come from .
  Then he said , kind of eagerly and happily : Where’s the raft .
 Hidden it in a good place .
 
.
I said : 
.
Why , that’s just what I was going to ask YOU , Your Grace .
 
.
Darned if I know what’s become of the raft .
 That old fool made a deal and got forty dollars , and when we found him in the saloon , those loafers had traded half dollars with him and tricked him out of every cent , aside from what he’d already spent on whisky .
 And when I got him home late last night and found the raft gone , we said , ‘That little rascale has stolen our raft and run off down the river .
 ’
.
I wouldn’t runaway from my N----- , would I .
 He’s the only n----- I had in the whole world , and he was the only thing I owned .
 
.
Well , we never thought of that .
 The fact is , I suppose we had come to think of him as OUR n----- .
 Yes , we did think of him that way—goodness knows we went to a lot of trouble for him .
 So when we saw that the raft was gone and that we were flat broke , the only thing left to do was to try the Royal Nonesuch scam again .
 I’ve been scraping by ever since—my wallet is as dry as a powder horncontainer used to hold gunpowderpowder horn .
 Where’s that ten cents .
 Give it to me .
 
.
Do you think that n----- would rat us out .
 We’d skin him if he did that .
 
.
He stopped , but I’ve never seen the duke’s eyes look so ugly before .
 I kept on wimpering , and said : 
.
He looked a little bothered by this , and stood there with his handbills fluttering under his arm , just thinking and wrinkling his forhead .
 Finally he said : 
.
I’ll tell you something .
 We’re going to be here for three days .
 If you promise not to tell on us and that you won’t let that n----- tell on us , I’ll tell you where you can find him .
 
.
So I promised , and he said : 
.
That was exactly what I wanted to hear , and the thing I’d been trying to get him to say .
 I wanted to be left alone so that I could put my plan in action .
 
.
So I left , and headed out for the backcountry .
 I didn’t look around , but I felt like he was watching me .
 I knew I could tire him out pretty quickly , so I went straight out into the countryside for about a mile before I stopped .
 Then I doubled back through the woods towards the Phelps farm .
 I figured I’d better start working on plan right away and not fool around .
 I wanted to make sure Jim didn’t say anything before the king and the duke got away .
 I didn’t want any more trouble with them .
 I’d seen all I wanted of them , and I wanted to be done with them forever .
 
.
It was hot and sunny when I got to the Phelps farm .
 Everything was still and quiet , just like a church on Sunday .
 The farmhands were out in the fields , and the bugs and flies in the air made a kind of faint droning sound that makes you feel lonely , as if everyone were dead and gone .
 If a breeze blew by and shook the leaves , it would make you feel awful sad , because it’d feel like ghosts were whispering—ghosts that had been dead for many years—and talking about you .
 Usually that kind of stuff will make you feel like YOU are dead too , and done with life .
 
.
I went around and climbed over the back stile by the ash hopper and headed toward the kitchen .
 When I got close , I heard the dim humming sound from a spinning wheel moving up and down .
 That’s when I knew I was dead , since that IS the loneliest sound in the whole world .
 
.
A n----- woman came running out of the kitchen with a rolling pin in her hand , crying , Go away , Tiger .
 Go on , Spot .
 Get out of here .
  She hit one and then another and sent them howling off .
 The rest left on their own , but in the next second , half of them came back , wagging their tails around me and making friends with me .
 There is no meanness in a hound .
 
.
Without thinking I said , Yes , ma’am .
 
.
But they just ducked their heads and put their fingers in their mouths and hid behind her .
 She continued : 
.
Lize , hurry up and make him a hot breakfast right away—or did you already eat breakfast on the boat .
 
.
I said I’d eaten on the boat .
 So she started heading back toward the house , leading me by the hand with the children running after .
 When we got there she sat me down in a split bottomed chair , sat herself down on a low stool in front of me , held both of my hands , and said : 
.
Now I can have a GOOD look at you .
 My Lord , I’ve been eager to see you plenty of times all these long years , and the day has finally come .
 We’ve been expecting you for at least a couple of days .
 What kept you .
 Did your boat run aground .
 
.
Don’t say yes ma’am—say Aunt Sally .
 Where did it run aground .
 
.
Well , running aground wasn’t the real problem—that only held us up a little .
 We also blew out a cylinder headmechanical component of a steam enginecylinder head .
 
.
Good gracious .
 Was anyone hurt .
 
.
No , ma’am .
 It just killed a n----- .
 
.
Who did you give your baggage to .
 
.
No one .
 
.
But , child , it’ll get stolen .
 
.
Not where I’ve hidden it , it won’t ,  I said .
 
.
Well , how did you eat breakfast on the boat if you arrived so early .
 
.
I saw that I was treading on thin ice , so I said : 
.
The captain saw me standing around and told me I better have something to eat before I went ashore .
 So he took me inside to the officers’ mess hall and gave me all I wanted .
 
.
I saw that I was in a fix now .
 But it wasn’t going to do any good to worry .
 There wasn’t anything I could do but sit tight and try and be ready to get out of the way when she found out .
 
.
I had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he came in .
 The bed hid him from view .
 MrsPhelps jumped for him , and said : 
.
Has he come .
 
.
No ,  said her husband .
 
.
I can’t imagine ,  said the old gentleman .
 I must say , it makes me feel awfully uneasy .
 
.
But , Sally , I COULDN’T have missed him on the road—YOU know that .
 
.
But Silas .
 Look over there .
 Look up the road .
 Isn’t that someone coming .
 
.
He ran to the window at the head of the bed , which gave MrsPhelps the chance she’d been looking for .
 She stooped down quickly at the foot of the bed and tugged at me , and out I came .
 And when he turned back from the window , there she stood , beaming and smiling as brightly as a burning house , and me looking meek and sweaty beside her .
 The old gentleman stared and said : 
.
Why , who’s that .
 
.
Who do you think it is .
 
.
I don’t have any idea .
 Who IS it .
 
.
It’s TOM SAWYER .
 
.
But their happiness wasn’t anything compared to mine .
 I felt like I was born again—I was so glad to find out who I was supposed to be .
 Well , they stuck to me like glue for two hours .
 My chin was worn out from telling them everything about my family—I mean , the Sawyer family .
 Actually , I told them everything that happened to all six of the Sawyer families .
 I explained all about how we blew out a cylinder head at the mouth of the White River , and how it had taken us three days to fix it .
 This story worked out fine since THEY didn’t know that it would take only three days to fix a cylinder head .
 I could have called it a bolthead , and they would have believed me .
 
.
Now I was feeling pretty good about the situation .
 Being Tom Sawyer was pretty easy , and it stayed nice and easy until later on when I heard a steamboat coming down the river .
 Then I asked myself what would happen if Tom Sawyer was on that ship .
 What if he walked in here all of a sudden and called out my name before I could signal him to keep quiet .
 
.
I’ve never done anything to hurt you .
 You know that .
 So why do you want to come back and haunt ME .
 
.
I said : 
.
I haven’t come back—I was never GONE .
 
.
The sound of my voice cleared his head a little , but he still wasn’t quite satisfied .
 He said : 
.
Don’t you try to fool me , because I wouldn’t do that to you .
 Honestly now—you’re not a ghost .
 
.
Honestly , I’m not ,  I said .
 
.
Well… I… I… well , that settles it , of course .
 But I can’t understand it at all .
 Look here—weren’t you MURDERED .
 
.
So he did , and that satisfied him .
 He was so glad to see me that he didn’t know what to do .
 He wanted to know everything right away , because he said it was a grand adventure and mysterious—just the kind of stuff he liked best .
 But I told him to wait for a little while .
 I told his driver to wait , and Tom and I rode off a little ways .
 I told him the trouble I was in , and asked for his advice on what we should do .
 He said to leave him alone for a minute and not to bother him .
 He thought and thought , and pretty soon he said : 
.
I said : 
.
All right , but wait a minute .
 There’s one more thing—something that NO ONE knows but me .
 There’s a n----- here , and I’m trying to steal him out of slavery .
 His name is JIM—it’s old Miss Watson’s slave , Jim .
 
.
He said : 
.
He stopped and started thinking again .
 I said : 
.
I know what you’re going to say .
 You’re going to say that stealing him is a dirty , low-down thing to do .
 So what , though .
 I’m low-down myself , and I’m going to steal him .
 I want you to not say anything or let on that you know .
 Will you .
 
.
His eyes lit up , and he said : 
.
I’ll HELP you steal him .
 
.
No way .
  I said .
 You’re joking .
 
.
Nope , I’m not joking .
 
.
This is great .
 Whoever thought that old mare could make the trip that quickly .
 I wished we had timed her .
 She’s not even sweating at all—not a single drop .
 Wow .
 Why , I wouldn’t sell that horse now , not even for a hundred dollars—honestly , I wouldn’t .
 And yet , before now I would have sold her for fifteen dollars because I thought that was all she was worth .
 
.
MrArchibald Nichols , I presume .
 
.
Tom took a look over his shoulder and said , Too late—the driver is already out of sight .
 
.
But we won’t LET you walk—it wouldn’t be in the nature of Southern hospitality to let you .
 Please , come on in .
 
.
Why , you little rascal .
 
.
He looked kind of hurt , and said : 
.
I’m surprised at you , ma’am .
 
.
You’re surprised… Well , who do you think I am .
 I have a half a mind to take and… Why did you kiss me .
 
.
He looked looked down humbly and said : 
.
I didn’t mean anything by it , ma’am .
 I didn’t mean any harm .
 I… I… I thought you’d like it .
 
.
Why you little fool .
  She picked up the spinning stick , and it looked like it was taking all her effort not to smack him with it .
 Why did you think I’d like it .
 
.
I don’t know .
 It’s just that they… they… they told me you would .
 
.
Well , everyone .
 They all said so , ma’am .
 
.
She did all she could do to hold her anger in .
 Her eyes snapped , and her fingers moved like she wanted to scratch him .
 She said : 
.
Who’s ‘everyone .
 ’ Tell me their names , or there’ll be one fewer idiot in this world .
 
.
You won’t , huh .
 You better believe it .
 
.
No , ma’am , honestly .
 I won’t ever do it again—until you ask me , that is .
 
.
Well , no .
 I… I… well , no , I don’t believe I did .
 
.
The Tom looked around the room again and said to me : 
.
No , not until you’ve asked me first .
 
.
She didn’t waste any time , but asked him , and then hugged him and kissed him over and over again .
 Then she turned him over to the old man , who hugged him too .
 After they quieted down a bit , she said : 
.
Dear me , I’ve never had such a surprise .
 We didn’t expect you at all , only Tom .
 Sis never said anything in her letters about anyone else coming except Tom .
 
.
Pa , may Tom and Sid and me go to the show .
 
.
We saw that we were too late to do anything .
 We asked some of the stragglers what was going on , and they said that everyone had gone to the show pretending that nothing was going on .
 They acted calm and didn’t say anything until the poor old king was in the middle of his routine where he cavorts around on the stage .
 Then someone gave a signal , and everyone got up and grabbed them .
 
.
We stopped talking and started think .
 Pretty soon Tom said : 
.
Look here , Huck—we’re fools for not having thought of it before .
 I bet I know where Jim is .
 
.
He’s in that hut down by the ash-hopper .
 Just think about it .
 When we were at dinner , did you see a n----- man go in there with some food .
 
.
Yes .
 
.
Well , what did you think the food was for .
 
.
For a dog .
 
.
So did I .
 Well , I don’t think it was for a dog .
 
.
Why .
 
.
Because the food included some watermelon .
 
.
Yes ,  I said .
 
.
All right—let’s hear it .
 
.
I didn’t say anything , but his response was just what I’d expected .
 I knew for certain , though , that no one would be able to make those same objections to HIS plan .
 
.
And no one could .
 He told me his plan , and I saw in a minute it has as much style as fifteen of my plans .
 It would also make Jim just as free as my plan would have , and it might get us all killed in the process .
 I was satisfied and said we should do it .
 I don’t need to bother explaining the plan here , because I knew he would change it every minute along the way , pulling new tricks whenever he had the chance .
 And that’s exactly what he did .
 
.
Don’t you think I know what I’m doing .
 Don’t I usually know what’s going on .
 
.
Yes .
 
.
Didn’t I SAY I was going to help steal a n----- .
 
.
Yes .
 
.
Well , there you go , then .
 
.
That’s all he said , and that’s all I said .
 It wasn’t any use to say anything more .
 When he said he was going to do something , he always did it .
 But I still didn’t understand why he was willing to help .
 I just let it go , and didn’t think any more about it .
 If he was intent on it being this way , then I couldn’t change it .
 
.
When we got home , the house was dark and still , so we went down to the hut by the ash-hopper to examine it .
 We went through the yard so we could see how the dogs would react .
 They knew us , and didn’t make any noise other than the noises country dogs usually make when something passes by in the night .
 When we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and the two sides .
 On the one side that I wasn’t familiar with—the north side—we found a square hole that served as a window .
 It was pretty high up and had one board nailed across it .
 I said : 
.
Here’s how we’ll do it .
 This hole is big enough for Jim to get through if we pulled the board off .
 
.
Tom said : 
.
The next morning , we got up at dawn and went down to the n----- cabins to pet the dogs and make friends with the n----- who’d fed Jim—if that WAS Jim who was being fed .
 The n------ were just finishing up breakfast and heading out to the fields .
 The n----- who fed Jim was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and things .
 While the others were leaving , the key came from the house .
 
.
The n----- had a good-natured , smiling face , and his hair was all tied up in little bunches with thread to keep the witches away .
 He said witches were pestering him pretty badly these past few nights , causing him to see and hear all kinds of strange things .
 He said he’d never been so bewitched in all his life .
 He got so worked up telling us all about his troubles that he forgot what he was going to do .
 So Tom said : 
.
What’s the food for .
 Going to feed the dogs .
 
.
Yes , Master Sid—a dog .
 Pretty interesting dog , too .
 Do you want to go and look at him .
 
.
Yes .
 
.
I pulled Tom aside and whispered : 
.
You’re going right in there in the midde of the day .
 THAT wasn’t the plan .
 
.
No it wasn’t .
 But it’s the plan NOW .
 
.
HUCK .
 And my word .
 Isn’t that Mister Tom .
 
.
Land’s sake .
 Does he know you gentlemen .
 
.
We could see pretty well now .
 Tom looked at the n----- slowly with a puzzled look on his face and said : 
.
Does WHO know us .
 
.
Why… this runaway n----- .
 
.
I don’t think he does .
 What would put that idea into your head .
 
.
What PUT it there .
 Didn’t he just cry out a minute ago that he knew you .
 
.
Tom said in a puzzled kind of way : 
.
Well that’s pretty funny .
 WHO cried out .
 And WHEN did he cry out .
 And WHAT did he cry out .
  He turned to me perfectly calm and said , Did YOU hear anyone cry out .
 
.
No .
 I didn’t hear anyone say anything .
 
.
Did you cry out .
 
.
No , sir ,  Jim said .
 I didn’t say anything , sir .
 
.
Not a word .
 
.
Have you ever seen us before .
 
.
No , sir .
 Not that I know of .
 
.
What’s the matter with you , anyway .
 What made you think someone had cried out .
 
.
Tom gave him a dime , and said we wouldn’t tell anyone .
 He also told him to buy some more thread to tie up his hair with .
 Then he looked at Jim and said : 
.
I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this n----- .
 If I were to catch a n----- that was ungrateful enough to run away , I wouldn’t give him away—I’d hang him .
  While the n----- stepped into the doorway to look at the dime in the sunlight and bite it to see if it was genuine , Tom whispered to Jim : 
.
Don’t ever say that you know us .
 And if you hear any digging going on at night , it’s us .
 We’re going to set you free .
 
.
Jim had just enough time to grab us each by the hand and squeeze them before the n----- came back .
 We said we’d come back again if the n----- wanted us to , and he said he’d like that , especially when it was dark since the witches usually went after him at night .
 He said it was good to have other people around .
 
.
What do we need a saw for .
 
.
What do we need a SAW for .
 Aren’t we going to have to saw the leg off Jim’s bed so we can get the chain loose .
 
.
But you just said that anyone could just lift up the end of the bed and slip the chain off .
 
.
That’s just like you , Huck Finn .
 You always come up with the most childish ways of doing things .
 Why , haven’t you read any books at all .
 Books about Baron Trenck or Casanova or Benvenuto Chelleeny or Henry IV or any of those heroes .
 Whoever heard of breaking a prisoner loose in such a granny-like way .
 No—all the top authorities on the matter say to saw the bed leg in two , and then make it look like it hadn’t been sawed at all .
 And you’ve got to swallow the sawdust so that it can’t be found and put some dirt and grease around the sawed place so that even the very best seneskalTom means seneschal , an officer of the peace akin to a sheriff in medieval Franceseneskal can’t find any evidence that it’s been sawed and thinks the bed leg is perfectly normal .
 And then on the night you’re ready , just give the bed leg a kick , and down it falls .
 Slip off the chain , and there you go .
 Then the only thing left to do is tie your rope ladder to the battlements , shimmy down , and break your leg in the moat when you let go of the ladder—which is nineteen feet too short , you know .
 Your horses will be there with your trusty vassles , who will scoop you up , fling you over the saddle , and take you back to your homeland in Langudoc or Navarre or wherever you’re from .
 It’s brilliant , Huck .
 I wish there was a moat around this cabin .
 If we have time on the night of the escape , we’ll dig one .
 
.
I said : 
.
Why do we want there to be a moat if we’re trying to sneak out from under the cabin .
 
.
But he didn’t hear me .
 He had forgotten about me and everything else .
 He sat thinking with his chin in his hand .
 Pretty soon he sighed and shook his head .
 Then he sighed again and said : 
.
No , it wouldn’t do—we don’t need to do it .
 
.
Why , saw Jim’s leg off , of course ,  he said .
 
.
Good Lord .
  I said .
 OF COURSE we don’t need to do that .
 Why would you ever want to saw his leg off anyway .
 
.
Well , some of the best authorities have done it .
 If they can’t get the chain off , they’ll cut their hand off and pull it through the shackle .
 A leg would be even better .
 But we’ve got to let that go .
 There isn’t enough of a need in this case .
 Besides , Jim’s a n----- .
 he wouldn’t understand why we’d cut his leg off , since it’s a European tradition .
 We’ll just let it go .
 But there is one thing—he can have a rope ladder .
 We can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder pretty easily .
 And we can deliver it to him in a pie since that’s how it’s usually done .
 Besides , I’ve eaten worse pies .
 
.
Just listen to yourself , Tom Sawyer ,  I said .
 Jim doesn’t need a rope ladder .
 
.
What in the world would he DO with it .
 
.
What would he DO with it .
 He can hide it in his bed , can’t he .
 That’s what they all do .
 And that’s what HE’S got to do it , too .
 Huck , you never want to do anything the way it’s supposed to be done .
 You want to find new ways of doing things all the time .
 Suppose he doesn’t do ANYTHING with it .
 Won’t it still be there in his bed—left as a clue—after he’s gone .
 And don’t you think they’ll want some clues .
 Of course they will .
 And you wouldn’t leave them any .
 That wouldn’t be too nice , WOULDN’T it .
 I never heard of such thing , Huck .
 
.
Well all right , Tom , have it your way .
 But if you’ll take my advice , you’ll let me take a sheet off the clothesline .
 
.
He said that would be fine .
 And that gave him another idea , too , and he said : 
.
Take a shirt , too .
 
.
What do we need a shirt for , Tom .
 
.
We’ll need it for Jim to keep a journal on .
 
.
Journal my butt—Jim can’t write .
 
.
Tom , we could just pull a feather out of a goose and make him a quill to write with .
 That’d even be faster , too .
 
.
There are no geese running around in castle dungeons for PRISONERS to pull the quills out of , you idiot .
 They ALWAYS make their pens out of the hardest , toughest , most difficult piece of old brass candlestick or whatever they can get their hands on .
 And it takes them weeks and weeks and months and months to file it down , too , because they’ve got to do it by rubbing it on the wall .
 THEY wouldn’t use a goose-quill even if they had it .
 That’s just not the way it’s done .
 
.
Well , then , what’ll we make the ink out of .
 
.
Jim doesn’t have any tin plates .
 They feed him from a pan .
 
.
That’s not a problem .
 We can get him some tin plates .
 
.
But no one would be able to read his writing on the plates .
 
.
That doesn’t have anything to DO with it , Huck Finn .
 All HE’S got to do is write on the plate and throw it out .
 You don’t HAVE to be able to read it .
 Why , half the time you can’t read anything a prisoner writes on a tin plate or anywyere else anyway .
 
.
Well , then , what’s the point of ruining the plates .
 
.
Why , darn it , they aren’t the PRISONER’S plates .
 
.
But they’re SOMEBODY’S plates , aren’t they .
 
.
He stopped talking because we heard the breakfast horn blowing .
 So we headed back to the house .
 
.
Well , as I was saying , we waited that morning until everyone had started work and no one was in sight in the yard .
 Then Tom carried the sack into the lean-to while I stood off a little ways to keep watch .
 Pretty soon , Tom came out of the lean-to , and we went and sat down by the woodpile to talk .
 He said : 
.
Everything’s set now except for the tools .
 And that’s easy to fix .
 
.
Tools .
  I asked .
 
.
Yes .
 
.
Tools for what .
 
.
Why , tools to dig with .
 We aren’t going to GNAW him out , are we .
 
.
Aren’t those old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a n----- out with .
  I said .
 
.
Huck Finn , did you EVER hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with .
 Now I want to ask you—if you have any sense in you at all—what kind of a drama would THAT bring to make Jim a hero .
 Why , they might as well just give him the key to unlock himself and be done with it .
 Picks and shovels—why , they wouldn’t give those tools to a king .
 
.
A couple of pocket knives .
 
.
To dig the foundation out from under that cabin .
 
.
Yes .
 
.
Darn it , Tom , that’s just silly .
 
.
I don’t know .
 
.
Well , take a guess .
 
.
JIM doesn’t know anyone in China .
 
.
What’s THAT got to do with it .
 Neither did that other fellow .
 But you’re always wandering off topic .
 Why can’t you ever stick to the main point .
 
.
All right—I don’t care where he comes out so long as he COMES out .
 And Jim doesn’t either , I suppose .
 But there’s one other thing—Jim’s too old to be dug out with a pocket knife .
 He wouldn’t last that long .
 
.
Yes he will LAST that long .
 You don’t think it’s going to take us thirty-seven years to dig through a DIRT foundation , do you .
 
.
Well how long will it take us , Tom .
 
.
Steal three ,  he said .
 We want to make a saw out of one .
 
.
Tom , I don’t mean to be rude or disrespectful ,  I said , but there’s an old rusty saw blade over there that’s sticking under the weather boarding behind the smokehouse .
 
.
Looking discouraged and kind of tired , he said : 
.
It isn’t any use trying to teach you anything , Huck .
 Go on and steal the knives—three of them .
  So I did .
 
.
He didn’t say anything , but he signed .
 Pretty soon he stopped digging , and I knew what he was thinking for a while .
 Then he said : 
.
Well then , what are we going to do , Tom .
 
.
His own pocketknife was next to him , but I handed him mine .
 He threw down , though , and said : 
.
Gimme a POCKETKNIFE .
 
.
He was always that picky .
 So full of principles .
 
.
So he did .
 
.
Now we’ve got to figure out how to get these things to Jim .
 
.
Just put them through the hole ,  I said , after we finish making it .
 
.
NOW I know how we can do it .
 We’ll send you some things with them .
 
.
Tom said : 
.
Well , then , I’ll have to make it myself .
 
.
Will you do it , honey .
 Will you .
 If you do , I’ll worship the ground under your feet , I will .
 
.
All right , I’ll do it , since you’ve been so good to us and showed us this runaway n----- .
 But you have to be pretty careful .
 When we come around , you have to turn your back .
 And no matter what we’ve put in the pan , you have to pretend you don’t see it .
 And you can’t look when Jim empties the pan—something might happen , but I don’t know exactly what .
 And above all else , don’t TOUCH any of the witch’s things .
 
.
I’ve searched high and low , but I don’t know where your other shirt is .
 
.
What else is gone , Sally .
 
.
Oh , no need to hurry .
 Next year will be just fine .
 Matlida Angelina Araminta PHELPS .
 
.
Sally hit the child with her thimble , and the kid pulled back her hands out of the sugar bowl right away .
 Just then a n----- woman stepped into the doorway and said : 
.
Mrs, there’s a sheet missing .
 
.
A SHEET missing .
 Well for heaven’s sake .
 
.
I’ll plug up those holes today ,  said Silas , looking glum .
 
.
Oh , SHUT UP .
 Imagine that—the rats took a sheet .
 Where did it go , Lize .
 
.
Mrs,  said a younger n----- , there’s a brass candlestick missing .
 
.
Get out of here , little missy , or I’ll smack you with a skillet .
 
.
Oh for heaven’s sake .
 Give it a rest .
 Go along now , all of you .
 Don’t come near me again until my peace of mind has been restored .
 
.
I can’t for the life of me remember when I filled them up .
 Well , now I can show her that none of this stuff about the rats was my fault .
 Oh , never mind—I’ll just let it go .
 It wouldn’t do any good anyway .
 
.
He mumbled as he went back upstairs , and then we left too .
 He was a really nice old man .
 He always is .
 
.
Why , Aunt Sally—there are STILL only nine spoons .
 
.
She said : 
.
Well , I just counted them twice , Aunty , and I only counted nine .
 
.
She looked flustered and impatient , but of course she came over to count them—anyone would .
 
.
I slipped the spoon back into the pile , and when she finished recounting them all , she said : 
.
What a bunch of garbage .
 Now there are TEN .
  She looked huffy and bothered , but Tom said : 
.
Why , Aunty , I don’t think there are ten .
 
.
You numbskull—didn’t you see me COUNT them .
 
.
Well , I’ll count them AGAIN .
 
.
With the help of the calf and the rats and the confusing countings , we were in a good position as far as the shirt , the sheet , the spoon , and the candles were concerned .
 As for the candlestick , it didn’t matter—that would work itself out soon .
 
.
But preparing that witch pie took considerable work .
 There was no end to our troubles with that pie .
 We prepared it and cooked it at a spot deep in the woods .
 We finished it just the way we planned , though not all in one day .
 We had to use three pans full of flour by the end of it , and we burned ourselves all over and got smoke in our eyes .
 You see , all we wanted was a pie crust , but we couldn’t keep an empty crust from collapsing and caving in at the middle .
 Of course , we finally figured out how to do it—we just had to cook a ladder in the pie .
 We visited Jim again on the second night , and tore the sheet into little strips .
 We twisted the strips together and , well before daylight , we had a lovely rope that you could hang a person with .
 We pretended that had taken us nine months to make .
 
.
We took the rope down to the woods the next morning , but it wouldn’t fit in the pie .
 Because it was made from an entire sheet , we had enough rope to fill forty pies if we’d needed , and we still would have had enough left over for soup or sausage or whatever else we chose .
 We could’ve made an entire fake dinner .
 
.
Jim said : 
.
Bud , Master Tom , I don’t have a coat of arms .
 I don’t have anything but this old shirt , and you know I’ve got to keep the journal on that .
 
.
Oh , you don’t understand , Jim .
 A coat of arms is different .
 
.
While Jim and I filed away at the metal to make the pens—Jim made one pen out of brass and I made one out of the spoon—Tom began thinking about what to do about the coat of arms .
 Pretty soon he said he had so many good ideas that he didn’t know which one to use , but he figured there was one that was the best .
 He said : 
.
We don’t have time to worry about all that ,  he said .
 We’ve got to dig in like there’s no tomorrow .
 
.
Well anyways ,  I said , Can you tell me what just SOME of it means .
 What’s a fess .
 
.
Oh , I don’t know .
 But he’s got to have it .
 All nobles do .
 
.
1 .
 Here a captive heart busted .
 
.
2 .
 Here a poor prisoner , forsaken by the world and friends , worried away his sad life .
 
.
3 .
 Here a lonely heart broke and a worn spirit died after thirty-seven years of solitary captivity .
 
.
4 .
 Here , homeless and friendless , after thirty-seven years of bitter captivity , died a noble stranger , the natural son of Louis XIV .
 
.
Come to think of it , the logs aren’t going to do—they don’t have log walls in dungeons .
 We’ve got to carve the inscriptions into a rock .
 We’ll have to get a rock .
 
.
Jim said that the rock would be worse than the logs .
 He said it would take him such a long time to carve the words into the rock that he’d never get out .
 But Tom said he’d let me help him do it .
 Then he looked to see how Jim and I were coming along with the pens .
 It was hard work and very tedious , and it wasn’t helping my hands to heal .
 We didn’t seem to be making any headway , so Tom said : 
.
Are there any spiders in here , Jim .
 
.
All right , we’ll get you some .
 
.
But bless you , honey , I don’t WANT any .
 I’m afraid of them .
 I would just as soon have rattlesnakes around .
 
.
Tom thought for a minute or two , then said : 
.
Keep what , Master Tom .
 
.
A rattlesnake , of course .
 
.
Goodness gracious , Master Tom .
 Why , if a rattlesnake came in here , I’d bust right through that log wall with my head .
 
.
But Jim , you wouldn’t be afraid of it after awhile .
 You could tame it .
 
.
TAME it .
 
.
PLEASE , Master Tom—DON’T talk like that .
 I can’t stand it .
 He’d LET me shove his head in my mouth—as a favor , huh .
 I guess he’d wait a long while before I ASKED him .
 And what’s more , I don’t WANT him to sleep with me .
 
.
But Master Tom , I don’t WANT that kind of glory .
 A snake would go and bite my chin off—where’s the glory in THAT .
 No sir , I don’t want anything like it .
 
.
Darn it , can’t you TRY .
 I only want you to TRY—you don’t have to keep doing it if it doesn’t work .
 
.
I CAN stand garden snakes , Master Tom , but darn it—I can get along just fine without them , I tell you .
 I never realized that it was so much hassle to free a prisoner .
 
.
Well it ALWAYS takes this much effort when it’s done properly .
 Are there any rats around here .
 
.
No sir .
 I haven’t seen any , 
.
Well , we’ll get you some rats .
 
.
But Jim , you’ve GOT to have them—all prisoners do .
 Don’t make any more fuss about it .
 Prisoners are always with rats .
 There isn’t one example of a prisoner without them .
 And they train them and pet them and teach them tricks , and those rats get to be as sociable as flies .
 But you have to play music to them .
 Have you got anything to play music with .
 
.
I don’t have anything except a coarse comb , a piece of paper , and a juice harpmispronunciation of Jew’s harp , a small musical instrument that produces sound when air is blown onto itjuice harp .
 But I reckon they wouldn’t like the music from a juice harp .
 
.
Yes , THEY will have a good time , Master Tom , but what kind of time will I be having .
 I’ll be darned if I can see the point of all this .
 But I’ll do it if I have to .
 I suppose I’d better keep those animals satisfied so there’s no trouble in the house .
 
.
Tom paused for a minute to see if there was anything he’d forgotten .
 Pretty soon he said : 
.
Oh , there’s one more thing that I forgot .
 Do you think you could grow a flower here .
 
.
Well , just try .
 Some other prisoners have done it .
 
.
I guess one of those big mullein stalks that looks like a cattail would grow in here , Master Tom , but it wouldn’t be worth half the trouble it would cause .
 
.
But I’ve got plenty of spring water , Master Tom .
 
.
But Master Tom , I reckon I can grow two of those mullein stalks with spring water in the time it takes to start growing one with tears .
 
.
That isn’t the point , though .
 You’ve GOT to do it with your tears .
 
.
It’ll die if I do that , Master Tom , it surely will .
 I hardly ever cry .
 
.
What’re those .
  I asked .
 
.
But look , Tom—why do we want to WARN anyone that something is up .
 Let them find out on their own—it’s their job to be on the lookout .
 
.
Yeah , I know , but you can’t depend on them .
 They’ve left us to do EVERYTHING for them from the beginning .
 They’re so trusting and idiotic that they haven’t noticed anything at all .
 If we don’t TELL them that something’s going on , then no one will interfer with us .
 After all our hard work and trouble , this escape will happen without a hitch and won’t mean anything at all .
 There won’t be anything TO it .
 
.
Well , as for me , Tom , that’s the way I like it .
 
.
Shoot .
  he said , looking disgusted .
 So I said : 
.
But I’m not going to complain .
 Whatever you want to do is fine by me .
 What are you going to do about the servant girl .
 
.
You can be the servant girl .
 You sneak in in the middle of the night and steal that yellowie , a light-skinned black complexionyellow girl’s frock .
 
.
All right , then , I’ll do it .
 But I could carry it just as easily in my own clothes .
 
.
Well , you wouldn’t look like a servant-girl THEN , would you .
 
.
No , but there won’t be anyone around to see what I look like ANYWAY .
 
.
That doesn’t have anything to do with it .
 We’ve got to do our DUTY and not worry about whether anyone SEES us or not .
 Haven’t you got any principles at all .
 
.
All right , I’m not going to argue .
 I’m the servant girl .
 Who’s Jim’s mother .
 
.
I’m his mother .
 I’ll steal a gown from Aunt Sally .
 
.
Well , then , you’ll have to stay in the cabin when Jim and I leave .
 
.
Not really .
 I’ll stuff Jim’s clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed to make it look like it’s his mother in disguise .
 And Jim will take the n----- woman’s gown off of me and wear it , and we’ll all evade together .
 When a prisoner of substance escapes it’s called evasion , you know .
 It’s always called that when a king escapes , for example .
 Same goes for when a king’s son tries to escape—it doesn’t make any difference whether he’s a natural son or an unnatural one .
 
.
Beware .
 Trouble is brewing .
 Keep a sharp lookout .
 UNKNOWN FRIEND .
 
.
Where’s the butter .
 
.
Well , you LEFT it downstairs then , because it isn’t here .
 
.
We can do without it ,  I said .
 
.
Have you been down in the cellar .
 
.
Yes , ma’m .
 
.
What were you doing down there .
 
.
Nothing .
 
.
NOTHING .
 
.
No , ma’m .
 
.
Well , what made you go down there at this time of night in the first place .
 
.
I don’t know , ma’m .
 
.
You don’t KNOW .
 Don’t tell me that .
 Tom , I want to know what you’ve been DOING down there .
 
.
I figured she’d let me go , and under normal circumstances she would have .
 But I suppose there were so many strange things going on that she was in a frenzy about every little thing that wasn’t perfectly normal .
 She said , in a very matter-of-fact way : 
.
Just march into the sitting room , and stay there until I come .
 You’ve been up to something you shouldn’t be doing , and I swear I’ll find out what it is before I’M done with you .
 
.
Hurry .
 HURRY .
  I said .
 Where’s Jim .
 
.
He’s right at your elbow .
 If you reach out your arm , you can touch him .
 He’s dressed , and everything’s ready .
 Now we’ll just sneak out of hear and give the sheep signal .
 
.
I TOLD you we’d get here too early .
 They haven’t come yet—the door is still locked .
 Here , I’ll lock some of you in the cabin , and you can wait for them in the dark and kill them when they come in .
 The rest of you can scatter around and listen if you can hear them coming .
 
.
Who’s that .
 Answer , or I’ll shoot .
 
.
They’re here .
 They’re running to the river .
 After them , boys , and turn the dogs loose .
 
.
And you did a good job , too , Huck .
 It was planned beautifully and you pulled it off perfectly .
 There isn’t ANYONE who can come up wth a plan as intricate and splendid as that one .
 
.
We were all very glad , but Tom was the gladdest of all , because he had a bullet lodged in his calf .
 
.
When Jim and I heard this we didn’t feel too happy anymore .
 Tom was in a lot of pain , and he was bleeding .
 We put him in the wigwam and tore up one of the duke’s shirts to use as a bandage , but he said : 
.
Give me the rags—I can do it myself .
 Don’t stop now , don’t fool around when the evasion is going so well .
 Man the oars and get her going .
 Boys , we did it beautifully .
 Yes , we did .
 I wish WE’D been the ones to try to break out Louis XVI .
 There wouldn’t have been a ‘Son of Saint Louis , ascend to heaven .
 words spoken at the execution of King Louis XVISon of Saint Louis , ascend to heaven .
 ’ written down in HIS biography .
 No sir , we’d have swooped him over the BORDER .
 That’s what WE would have done with HIM , and done it just as slick as anything , too .
 Man the oars , man the oars .
 
.
But Jim and I were talking it over and thinking .
 And after we’d thought a minute , I said : 
.
Just say it , Jim .
 
.
So he said : 
.
I knew Jim was like a white man inside , and I figured that’s what he’d say—so it was settled , and I told Tom that I was going back to get a doctor .
 He put up a big fuss over it , but Jim and I wouldn’t budge .
 Tom wanted to crawl out of the wigwam and set the raft loose himself , but we wouldn’t let him .
 Then he started yelling at us , giving us a piece of his mind .
 But it didn’t do any good .
 
.
So when he saw me getting the canoe ready , he said : 
.
Who’re your folks .
  he asked .
 
.
The Phelpses , down that way .
 
.
Oh ,  he said .
 After another minute he said : 
.
How’d you say he got shot .
 
.
Pretty unusual dream ,  he said .
 
.
Why , myself , Sid , and… and… and the GUNS .
 That’s what I meant .
 
.
Oh ,  he said .
 
.
Pretty soon I had an idea .
 What if he can’t fix that leg quickly .
 I asked myself .
 What if it takes him three or four days .
 What are we going to do—wait around there until he tells everyone about us .
 No sir .
 I know what I’ll do .
 I’ll wait , and if he says he’s going to need to do some more work when he comes back , then I’ll go down there , swim if I have to .
 Then we’ll tie up the doctor and keep him on the raft and shove out into the river .
 And when he’s done with Tom , we’ll pay him for his services , or give him all the money we have , and then let him go ashore .
 
.
So I crept into a pile of lumber to get some sleep .
 When I woke up , the sun was already way over my head .
 I jumped up and headed for the doctor’s house , but they told me he’d gone away at some point in the night and wasn’t back yet .
 I thought to myself that this looked pretty bad for Tom , and decided to head straight for the island right away .
 I ran off , rounded the corner of the house , and nearly rammed head first into Uncle Silas’s stomach .
 He said : 
.
Why , TOM .
 Where have you been all this time , you rascal .
 
.
Why , where in the world did you go .
  he asked .
 Your aunt has been very worried .
 
.
The place was full of farmers and farmers’ wives .
 They were all over for dinner .
 They made more noise than I’d ever heard .
 Old MrsHotchkiss was the worst—she talked the whole time .
 She said : 
.
My thoughts exactly , Brother Penrod .
 I was just saying—pass the molassess , won’t you .
 —I was saying to Sister Dunlap just a minute ago , how DID they get that grindstone in there .
 Without HELP , mind you—without HELP .
 THAT’S what I want to know .
 Don’t tell ME any different—there WAS help .
 There was PLENTY of help too , I tell you .
 There was a DOZEN people helping that n----- , and I say I’d skin every last n----- on this farm to find out who helped .
 Moreover… .
 
.
I’ll run straight into town and get him ,  I said .
 
.
No , you won’t ,  she said .
 You’ll stay right where you are .
 ONE lost child is enough .
 If he isn’t here for supper , your uncle will go .
 
.
He came back after around ten o’clock feeling a bit nervous .
 He hadn’t run across Tom’s tracks .
 Aunt Sally was REALLY nervous , but Uncle Silas said there wasn’t any reason to be .
 Boys will be boys , he said .
 He said that Sid would turn up in the morning safe and sound , and not to be worried .
 But she said she’d sit up for awhile anyway and keep a light burning so that he could see it .
 
.
The door isn’t going to be locked , Tom , and there’s the window and lightning rod .
 But you’ll be good , WON’T you .
 You won’t go .
 For MY sake .
 
.
Lord knows I WANTED badly to go find out about Tom .
 I was even intending to go , but after she said that , I couldn’t have gone for all the kingdoms in the world .
 
.
Did I give you the letter .
 
.
What letter .
 
.
The one I got yesterday out of the post office .
 
.
No , you didn’t give me a letter .
 
.
Well , I must have forgot it .
 
.
Why , it’s from StPetersburg—it’s from Sis .
 
.
Tom turned his head a little and muttered something , which told me he wasn’t in his right mind .
 Then she threw up her hands and said : 
.
Someone said : 
.
Well , I have to say , that all sounds very good .
 
.
Hey .
 I’m HOME .
 How’d that happen .
 Where’s the raft .
 
.
It’s all right ,  I said .
 
.
And JIM .
 
.
The same ,  I said , but couldn’t say it with much confidence .
 He didn’t notice , though , and said : 
.
Why , about the whole thing that we did , of course .
 
.
What whole thing .
 
.
THE whole thing .
 There’s only one thing we did .
 You know , how we set the runaway n----- free—me and Tom .
 
.
Goodness gracious .
 Set the run…What IS this child talking about .
 Oh dear , oh dear , he’s lost his mind again .
 
.
For heaven’s sake .
 
.
Well , I’ve never heard anything like it in all my days .
 So it was YOU , you little rapscallions , that have been making all this trouble and driving us out of our minds and scaring us all to death .
 I have half a mind to beat you two this very minute .
 To think , here I’ve been , night after night , and… YOU just get well , you little scamp , and then I’ll tan the both of your hides .
 
.
Well , you get all the fun out of it that you can NOW , because I tell you if I catch you messing around with him again…
.
Messing around with WHOM .
  Tom asked , dropping his smile and looking surprised .
 
.
With WHOM .
 Why , the runaway n----- , of course .
 Who do you think .
 
.
Tom looked at me very seriously and said : 
.
Tom , didn’t you just tell me he was all right .
 Hasn’t he gotten away .
 
.
What DOES the child mean .
 
.
I mean every word that I’m SAYING , Aunt Sally , and if someone doesn’t go out there and do it , I’ll go out there myself .
 I’ve known him all his life and so has Tom here .
 Old Miss Watson died two months ago , and she was ashamed that she was ever going to sell him down the river .
 She SAID so , and she set him free in her will .
 
.
Then what on earth did YOU want to set him free for if he was already free .
 
.
What kind of question is THAT .
 Women .
 Why , I wanted to have an ADVENTURE , of course .
 I wanted to wade neck-deep in blood to… goodness gracious , AUNT POLLY .
 
.
I’ll be darned—she was standing right there , just inside the door , looking as sweet and contented as an angel stuff full of pie .
 
.
Yes , you BETTER turn your head away , if I were you , Tom .
 
.
Oh dear me .
  said Aunt Sally .
 Has he changed that much .
 Why , that’s not TOM—that’s Sid .
 Tom is… hey , where is Tom .
 He was here a minute ago .
 
.
You mean where’s HUCK FINN—that’s what you mean .
 I imagine I haven’t raised a little tramp like Tom all my life to not recognize him when I see him .
 That WOULD be something , wouldn’t it .
 Come out from under that bed , Huck Finn .
 
.
So I did .
 But not feeling very sure of myself .
 
.
Tom and his Aunt Polly were right about Miss Watson having set Jim free in her will .
 And so , sure enough , Tom Sawyer had gone to all that trouble to set a free n----- free .
 It was then that I understood how he—with his kind of uprbringing—COULD help someone set a n----- free .
 
.
Well , Aunt Polly said that when Aunt Sally had written to her that Tom and Sid had come back safe and sound , she’d said to herself : 
.
Well would you look at that .
 I should have expected this after letting him go off on his own without anyone to watch him .
 Now I have to go and travel all the way down the river , eleven hundred miles , and find out what that child is up to THIS time since I can’t seem to get an answer out of you about what’s going on .
 
.
But , I never heard anything from you ,  said Aunt Sally .
 
.
I wonder why .
 I wrote you twice to ask you what you meant when you said that Sid was here .
 
.
Well , I never got the letters , Sis .
 
.
Aunt Polly turned around slowly and severely , and said : 
.
Tom .
 
.
WHAT .
  he asked kind of sheepishly .
 
.
What letters .
 
.
They’re in the trunk .
 Over there .
 And they’re just the same as they were when I got them out of the office—I haven’t looked in them , and I haven’t touched them .
 But I knew they’d mean trouble , and I thought that if you weren’t in a hurry , I’d… .
 
.
Well , you DESERVE to be skinned , make no mistake about that .
 I wrote you another letter to tell you that I was coming , and I suppose he… .
 
.
I wanted to offer a two dollars bet that she didn’t have it , but I decided it was safer not to .
 So I didn’t say anything .
 
.
No , he hasn’t ,  said Tom .
 It’s all there—six thousand dollars and more .
 And your Pap hasn’t ever been back since .
 He hadn’t by the time I’d left anyway .
 
.
Jim said , kind of solemnly : 
.
He won’t be coming back anymore , Huck .
 
.
I said : 
.
Why , Jim .
 
.
Nevermind why , Huck—but he won’t be coming back anymore .
 
.
