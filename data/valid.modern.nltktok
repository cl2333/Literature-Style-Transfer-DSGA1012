 For the time would come when the gaunt , jobless , and hungry citizens who watched the lamplighter for so long would think up a better way to do his job . They would hang men by those ropes and pulleys , instead of lamps , revealing their inner darkness . But that time had not yet come . Instead , everyone ignored the warning signs that revolution might be on its way . 
 The wine shop was on a corner . It was nicer than most other shops , and the owner stood outside wearing a yellow jacket and green pants , watching people fight for the spilled wine . It's not my problem , he said , shrugging his shoulders . It's the market people's fault . Let them bring me another cask . Then he saw the tall prankster writing on the wall . He yelled to the man across the street . 
 Hey , Gaspard ! What are you doing over there ? The man pointed proudly to the word he had written , as pranksters often do . The joke failed , as pranksters' jokes often do as well . What are you doing ? Are you crazy ? said the owner of the wine shop , crossing the road and covering the word with a handful of mud . Why are you writing this in public ? Tell me , is there no other place you can write such words ? 
 While he was talking , he placed his clean hand (possibly by accident , possibly not) over the prankster's heart . The prankster tapped it with his own hand , jumped up quickly , and landed in a strange dancing pose , holding one of his stained shoe in his hand threateningly . The prankster was a resourceful man . 
 Put your shoe back on , said the wine shop owner . Go get some wine and leave that alone . He wiped his dirty hand on the prankster's dirty clothes , since the prankster was the reason he had gotten his hand dirty in the first place . Then he went back to the wine shop . The wine shop owner was a stocky , military-looking thirty-year-old man . He must have had a hot temper , since he wore no coat even though it was bitterly cold , though he carried a coat slung over his shoulder . 
 His sleeves were rolled up and his tan arms were bare to his elbows . He wore no hat either , just his short , curly , dark hair . He had a dark complexion , and his good eyes were spaced far apart . He was a pleasant-looking man overall , but stubborn-looking , too . He was a decisive man of strong principles . You wouldn't want to see him charging toward you on a narrow bridge , because nothing would stop him . 
 Madame Defarge , his wife , was sitting behind the shop counter when he came in . She was a large woman about the same age as he was , with alert eyes that rarely seemed to look directly at anything . She had large hands with many rings on them , a calm face , strong features , and had great self-control . There was something about her that made you think that she rarely made mistakes . Madame Defarge , being sensitive to the cold , was wrapped up in fur . She had a large , brightly colored shawl wrapped around her head , though it didn't hide her large earrings . 
 Her knitting was in front of her , where she had laid it down to pick her teeth with a toothpick . She sat picking her teeth with her right elbow supported by her left hand , and didn't say anything when her husband came in . She cleared her throat and raised her eyebrows slightly , indicating to her husband that he should look around the shop for any new customers that had arrived while he was across the street . 
 He looked around and saw an old gentleman and a young woman sitting in the corner . Other people were in the shop too : two were playing cards , two were playing dominoes , and three were standing by the counter trying to make the most of a small amount of wine . As he stepped behind the counter , he noticed the old gentleman give a look to the young woman as if to say , This is the man we're looking for . 
 What the devil are you doing here ? Monsieur Defarge thought . I don't know you . He pretended not to notice the two strangers and went to talk with the three customers drinking at the counter . How's it going , Jacques ? said one of the three to Monsieur Defarge . Has all the spilled wine been drunk ? Every drop , Jacques , answered Monsieur Defarge . 
 After this greeting by first names , Madame Defarge , while picking her teeth with her toothpick , cleared her throat again and raised her eyebrows a bit higher . It is not often , the second man said to Monsieur Defarge , that these pathetic creatures get to taste wine , or anything besides black bread and death . Don't you agree , Jacques ? 
 That's true , Jacques , Monsieur Defarge returned . After this second exchange of first names , Madame Defarge , still calmly picking her teeth , cleared her throat again and raised her eyebrows a bit higher . The third man now set down his empty cup , smacked his lips , and said : Ah ! That's even worse ! These poor animals always have a sour taste in their mouths , and their lives are hard , Jacques . Am I right , Jacques ? 
 You are right , Jacques , answered Monsieur Defarge . They completed this third exchange of first names just as Madame Defarge put down her toothpick and shifted slightly in her seat , with her eyebrows still up . Hold up . Wait , muttered Monsieur Defarge . Gentlemen , this is my wife ! The three customers took off their hats and gestured grandly to Madame Defarge . She acknowledged their respect by bowing her head and giving them a quick look . Then she looked casually around the wine shop and calmly went back to her knitting . 
 Good day , gentlemen , said her husband , who had been watching her carefully . The apartment you had asked about while I was out is on the fifth floor . The doorway of the staircase opens out onto a little courtyard close to the left here , near the window of my shop , he said , pointing with his hand . But now I remember that one of you has been there before and can lead way . Goodbye , gentlemen ! 
 They paid for the wine and left . Monsieur Defarge was watching his wife knit when the old gentleman came over and asked to speak with him . Of course , sir , Monsieur Defarge said and walked quietly with him to the door . Their conversation was short but to the point . Almost at the first word , Monsieur Defarge jumped to attention . Moments later , he nodded and went out . The gentleman motioned to the young lady , and they also went out . Madame Defarge kept knitting and pretended not to notice . 
 Mr . Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette came out of the wine shop and joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway he had just directed the three customers to . It opened onto a dark , stinking little courtyard that served as the public entrance to many houses , where a great number of people lived . In the gloomy tiled entry to the gloomy tiled staircase , Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee in front of the child of his old master and kissed her hand . Though the gesture was kind , he didn't do it kindly . In just a few seconds , he had changed . His face was no longer pleasant or friendly , but had become secretive , angry , and dangerous . 
 It is very high up , and a little difficult to get to . It's best to start slowly , Monsieur Defarge said in a stern voice to Mr . Lorry as they began to climb the stairs . Is he alone ? Mr . Lorry whispered . Alone ? God help him , who would be with him ! said Monsieur Defarge , in the same quiet voice . Is he always alone ? Yes . By his own choice ? He needs to be . He's been the same since I first saw himsince they found me and asked if I would take care of him in secret . 
 Has he changed much ? Changed ! Monsieur Defarge stopped to hit the wall with his hand , and he cursed . No direct answer could have been half as effective . Mr . Lorry's mood grew grimmer as he and the two others climbed the stairs . An old staircase like this one , located in the older and more crowded parts of Paris , would be bad enough today 1859 today . But back then they were particularly disgusting , especially to people who weren't used to them . 
 Every little apartment in one of these large buildings that opened onto the public staircase dumped its garbage on the landing . Other refuse got thrown out the windows . This unmanageable and hopeless pile of rotting garbage would have polluted the air even if it had not been the garbage of the poor , but the combination of trash and poverty made the smell almost unbearable . The three people walked through all this filth and up a steep , dark , dirty stairwell . 
 Giving in to his own troubled thoughts and to Miss Manette's anxiety , which became greater every moment , Mr . Jarvis Lorry stopped twice to rest . Each stop was made near a miserable air vent , through which any clean air that was left seemed to escape , and through which rotten air seemed to enter . Through the air vents you could taste , rather than see , parts of the neighborhood . Nothing nearby , from that spot to the great towers of Notre Dame , showed any signs of good health or good thoughts . 
 At last they reached the top of the staircase , and they stopped for the third time . They still needed to climb a steeper , narrower upper staircase to reach the attic . The owner of the wine shop walked a little ahead of them and always stayed next to Mr . Lorry , as though afraid the young lady might ask him a question . He turned around and carefully removed a key from the pocket of the coat he carried over his shoulder . 
 Then the door is locked , my friend ? asked Mr . Lorry , surprised . Oh , yes , Monsieur Defarge answered seriously . You think it's necessary to keep the poor gentleman locked up ? I think it's necessary to turn the key , Monsieur Defarge whispered in his ear , and frowned heavily . Why ? Why ! Because he has been locked up for so long that he would be afraid , go mad , tear himself apart , die , or some other terrible thing if his door were left open . 
 Is that possible ? exclaimed Mr . Lorry . Is that possible ! repeated Defarge , bitterly . Yes , and what a wonderful world we live in when such a thing is possible , and not only possible , but happensactually happens ! every day . Long live the devil . Let's keep going . They spoke too quietly for the young woman to hear , but by now fear and anxiety shook her so much that Mr . Lorry felt he should reassure her . 
 Be brave , miss ! Courage ! This is business ! The worst part will be over in a moment . It's just walking into a room , and the worst is over . Then , all the goodness , all the relief , all the happiness you'll bring him will begin . Let our good friend here help you . Our good friend Monsieur Defarge . Come , now . Business , business ! 
 They went up slowly and quietly . The staircase was short , and they were soon at the top . As they rounded a sharp turn in the staircase , they suddenly saw three men . Their heads were bent down close together at the side of the door , and they were intently looking into the room through some cracks in the wall . When they heard footsteps approach , the three men turned and stood up . They were the three men named Jacques who had been drinking in the wine shop . 
 I forgot about them when your visit surprised me , explained Monsieur Defarge . Go away , my friends ; we have business here . The three men slipped past and went silently downstairs . Since there didn't appear to be any other doors on that floor , and the wine-shop owner went straight to this one when they were alone , Mr . Lorry asked him in a whisper , a little angry : Are you making a spectacle of Monsieur Manette ? 
 I show him , in the way you just saw , to a select few . Is that proper ? I think it's proper . Who are the few ? How do you select them ? I select true men . Men with my name , Jacques , who would benefit from seeing him . I won't say anymore . You are English . You wouldn't understand . Please wait there for a moment . He motioned for them to stay back , then leaned over and looked in through the crack in the wall . Soon he raised his head and knocked two or three times on the doorapparently just to make noise . 
 For this same reason , he dragged the key across the door three or four times before clumsily putting it in the lock and loudly turning it . He slowly opened the door slowly , looked into the room , and said something . A quiet voice answered back . Neither person spoke much more than a syllable . Defarge looked back over his shoulder and motioned for them to enter . Mr . Lorry felt Miss Manette sink so he put his arm around her waist . 
 A-a-a-business , business ! he said , with a tear on his cheek that had nothing to do with business . Come in ! I'm afraid of it , she answered , trembling . Of ëit' ? Of what ? I mean of him . Of my father . Concerned by the state she was in and by the gesturing of Monsieur Defarge , Mr . Lorry pulled her arm around his neck , lifted her slightly , and rushed her into the room . He sat her down just inside the door and held her as she clung to him . 
 Defarge took out the key , closed the door , and locked it from the inside . Then he took the key and held it in his hand . He did all of this methodically , making as much noise as he could . Finally he crossed the room to the window , where he stopped and turned around . The attic had been built to be a storage room for firewood and other things . It was dim and dark . The window was actually a door in the roof , with a small pulley over it for lifting things from the street . There were no windowpanes , and it had two pieces that met in the middle to close it , like any other French door . 
 To keep out the cold , one half of the door was closed tight , and the other was opened very slightly . Such a small amount of light came through that it was hard to see anything when one first entered the room . It would have taken a long time to adjust to the darkness enough to be able to do any kind of detailed work there . Yet , that kind of work was being done in the attic . With his back to the door and his face toward the window where Monsieur Defarge stood looking at him , a white-haired man sat on a short bench , bent over and very busy , making shoes . 
 Good day ! said Monsieur Defarge to the white-haired man , who was bent over making shoes . The man looked up for a moment and answered quietly , as if he were far away : Good day ! You are still hard at work , I see ? After a long pause , the man looked up and answered . Yes , I am working . This time the man raised his haggard eyes up to him before looking down again . 
 His voice was so quiet it was pitiful and dreadful . It wasn't quiet because the man was physically weak , although being locked up and treated badly had done their part . His voice was quiet because he had been kept alone and hadn't used it . It was like the last feeble echo of a sound made a long , long time ago . It had lost so much of its liveliness and sound that it was like a beautiful color that has faded away to a faint stain . It was so low that it sounded like it was coming from underground . It was so sad and hopeless that it would have reminded a starving traveler , exhausted by wandering in the wilderness , of his home and friends just before he lied down to die . 
 The man worked silently for a few minutes . His tired eyes looked up again , not with any interest or curiosity , but mechanically , and he noticed that Monsieur Defarge had not yet left . I want to let a little more light in here , said Defarge , who was still staring at the shoemaker . Can you handle a little more light ? Monsieur Manette stopped working . He looked down at the floor beside him with a vacant air of listening , then at the floor on the other side of him , then up at Monsieur Defarge . 
 What did you say ? Can you stand a little more light ? I must stand it , if you let more in , he said , slightly stressing the word must . Defarge propped the half door open a little more . A broad shaft of light came into the attic and revealed the shoemaker with an unfinished shoe in his lap as he paused his work . A few basic tools and some leather scraps were around him at his feet and on the bench . He had a white , ragged beard that wasn't very long , a thin face , and very bright eyes . 
 The emptiness and thinness of his face would ordinarily have made his eyes look large under his dark eyebrows and tangled white hair . But they were naturally large , so now they looked unnaturally big . His yellow , tattered shirt was open at the throat , showing that his body was skinny and worn out . The old man , his old coat , his baggy stockings , and his tattered clothes had all been away from light and air for so long that they had turned a single shade of yellow , making it hard to distinguish one from the other . 
 He raised his hand to shield his eyes from the light , and even the bones of it seemed transparent . He had stopped working and sat there with a steady , empty look . He never looked at the man in front of him without first looking down on this side of himself , then on the other , as if he had forgotten how to tell where sound was coming from . He never said anything without doing this first , then forgetting to speak . 
 Are you going to finish that pair of shoes today ? asked Defarge , motioning to Mr . Lorry to come forward . What did you say ? Do you plan on finishing that pair of shoes today ? I can't say that I plan to . I guess so . I don't know . The question reminded him of his work , and he bent over the shoes and started working again . Mr . Lorry moved forward silently , leaving Miss Manette by the door . After he had stood next to Defarge for a minute or two , the shoemaker looked up . He didn't seem surprised to see another person , but the shaky fingers on one of his hands moved to his lips as he looked at him . (His lips and nails were both the same pale lead color . 
 Then he dropped his hand back to the shoes and started working again . This look and action happened in an instant . You have a visitor , you see , said Monsieur Defarge . What did you say ? There is a visitor here to see you . The shoemaker looked up as he had before , but without taking his hand off the shoes . Come ! said Defarge . Here is a man who knows a well-made shoe when he sees one . Show him that shoe you're working on . Take it , monsieur . Mr . Lorry took the shoe in his hand . 
 Tell this man what kind of shoe it is and who made it . There was a longer pause than usual before the shoemaker answered : I forget what you asked me . What did you say ? I said , won't you describe to this man what kind of shoe it is ? It is a lady's shoe . It is a young lady's walking shoe . It's in the latest style . I've never seen the style , but I've had a pattern to work from . He looked at the shoe with a slight hint of pride . 
 And who made it ? asked Defarge . Now that he didn't have the shoes to hold onto , he kept wringing his hands and stroking his beard . Every time he finished speaking , the man's mind would wander off again . Trying to keep his attention was like trying to revive a person who had fainted , or like trying to keep a dying man alive to get information from him . 
 Did you ask me what my name was ? Yes , I did . My name is One Hundred and Five , North Tower . Is that it ? One Hundred and Five , North Tower . With a weary sound that wasn't a sigh or a groan he resumed working , until the silence was broken again . You're not a professional shoemaker , are you ? asked Mr . Lorry , staring at him . The man looked wearily at Defarge as if he wanted him to answer the question for him . When Defarge didn't respond , the man looked at the ground and then back at Mr . Lorry . 
 Am I professional shoemaker ? No , I was not a professional shoemaker . I-I learned how to make shoes here . I taught myself . I asked permission to . He stared off for a few minutes , wringing his hands the whole time . Slowly he looked back toward Mr . Lorry . When he looked at him he flinched and started up again as if he had just been woken up and was continuing a conversation from the night before . 
 I asked permission to teach myself , and after fighting with them a long time they let me . I have been making shoes ever since . He held out a hand for the shoe that Mr . Lorry was holding . Mr . Lorry was still staring at him . Monsieur Manette , don't you remember me ? asked Mr . Lorry . Monsieur Manette dropped the shoe and sat staring at Mr . Lorry . Mr . Lorry put his hand on Defarge's arm . Monsieur Manette , Mr . Lorry said , laying his hand upon Defarge's arm , don't you remember this man ? Look at him . Look at me . Do you not remember an old banker ? Some old business ? An old servant ? A time long ago , Monsieur Manette ? 
 His mind clouded over again . He looked at the two men with less and less understanding , and his eyes wandered back to the ground the way they had before . Finally , sighing deeply , he picked up the shoe and went back to work . Did you recognize him , monsieur ? whispered Defarge . Yes . For just a second . At first I thought it was hopeless . But I have definitely seen , for one moment , the face that I once knew very well . Quiet ! Let's move back a little . Quiet ! 
 Miss Manette had moved away from the attic wall and was very close to the bench he sat on . There was something terrible about the fact that he was unaware of someone so close she could have reached out and touched him . No one said a word . No one made a sound . She stood next to him like a ghost as he bent over his work . After a while he put down the tool in his hand to pick up his shoemaker's knife . It was on the side of the bench opposite where she stood . He had picked it up and was leaning over to start working again when he noticed the bottom of her dress . He looked up and saw her face . 
 He stared at her with a frightened look . After a while he started to form words with his lips , although he wasn't making any sound . Little by little , in between his quick , heavy breaths , he said : What is this ? With tears running down her face , she blew him a kiss with both hands . Then she placed her hands on her heart as if she were holding his head to it . You aren't the jailer's daughter ? No , she sighed . Who are you ? 
 Still afraid to speak , she sat down next to him on the bench . He pulled away , but she placed her hand on his arm . As she did , a strange excitement struck him , and passed through him visibly . He gently put down the knife and sat there staring at her . Her long , curly blond hair had been brushed aside and fell down over her neck . Moving his hand toward her little by little , he picked up her hair and looked at it . While doing this , his mind wandered again , and with another deep sigh , he went back to his shoemaking . 
 This didn't last long , though . Letting go of his arm , she placed her hand on his shoulder . He looked at it suspiciously two or three times , as if to make sure it was really there . Then he laid down his work , reached his hand up to his neck , and removed a black string with a folded scrap of rag tied to it . Carefully he unfolded it on his knee . Inside were one or two long golden hairs , which he had wrapped around his finger long ago . 
 He took her hair in his hand again and looked closely at it . It's the same . How can that be ! When ! How ! As the intense expression reappeared on his forehead , he seemed to realize that the same expression was on her forehead too . He moved her into the light and looked at her . The night I was taken away , she had put her head on my shoulder . She was afraid I was going away , though I wasn't . When they brought me to the North Tower they found these hairs on my sleeve . Will you leave them with me ? ' I asked . ëThey can't help me escape this place physically , though they may help me escape spiritually . Those were the words I said . I remember them very well . 
 He formed these words silently with his lips many times before he could say them out loud . When he did finally speak them , he said them clearly , though slowly . How did this happen ? WAS IT YOU ? Once again the two men jumped as the old man turned toward her suddenly . But she sat completely still there as he held onto her and only said quietly , Please , gentlemen , don't come near us . Don't speak . Don't move . 
 Listen ! Monsieur Manette cried . Whose voice was that ? He let go of her as he yelled this out and tore at his white hair in a frenzy . This fit died down , much like everything had died out of him over the years except for his interest in shoemaking . He folded up the rag and tried to tie it around his neck again . He was still looking at her and sadly shaking his head . 
 No , no , no . You are too young . Too full of life . It can't be you . These are not the hands she knew , this is not the face she knew , this is not a voice she ever heard . No , no . She was , and he was , before all those slow-moving years I spent in the North Toweryears ago . What is your name , my gentle angel ? Noticing that he had softened his tone of voice and behavior , his daughter fell down on her knees in front of him and placed her hands on his chest . 
 Oh , sir ! Some other time I will tell you my name , and who my mother was , and who my father was , and how I never knew their awful story . But I can't tell you right now , not here . All I can ask right now is that you touch me and give me your blessing . Kiss me , kiss me ! Oh my dear , my dear ! His cold white hair mixed with her shining blond hair , and it was as if her hair warmed his like the light of freedom shining on him . 
 If my voiceI don't know if it does , but if soif it reminds you of a voice that was once sweet music in your ears , cry for it ! If touching my hair reminds you of the head that once rested on your chest when you were young and free , cry for it ! If I hint that a home awaits you where I will take care of you , and it reminds you of the long-empty home you remembered from afar , cry for it ! She hugged him around the neck and rocked him back and forth like a child . 
 I tell you that your agony is over , and that I've come here to take you from it , and that we're going to England to be at peace . If that causes you to think of your wasted life , and how our home country , France , has mistreated you , cry for it ! When I tell you my name , and about my father who is living , and about my mother who is dead , if you find out that I must beg my father's forgiveness because I didn't stay awake crying all night since my mother never told me of his imprisonment , cry for it ! Cry for her , then , and for me ! Gentlemen , thank God ! 
 I feel God's tears on my face and his sobbing in my heart . Thank God ! He had fallen into her arms and rested his head on her chest . The two men were so moved by the sight , and by knowing all the injustice and suffering that had happened before it , that they covered their faces to hide their tears . When it had been quiet in the attic for a while and the old man had stopped shaking and gave in to the calm that follows any storm , the two men stepped forward . They lifted the man and his daughter up off the ground . He had slowly fallen to the floor and lay there exhausted . 
 She had settled down with him , keeping her arm under his head . Her hair was draped over his face and shielded him from the light . Miss Manette raised her hand to Mr . Lorry , as he stooped over them after repeatedly blowing his nose , and said , If we can do it without upsetting him , I would like to leave for Paris right away . But do you think he is fit to travel ? asked Mr . Lorry . 
 More fit to travel , I think , than to stay in this city , where he has been treated so terribly . It's true , said Defarge , who was kneeling nearby . More importantly , Monsieur Manette will be safer outside of France . Should I hire a carriage and horses ? That's a business matter , said Mr . Lorry , going back to his professional demeanor . And if business needs to be done , then I should be the one to do it . Then will you please leave us here ? asked Miss Manette . You see how calm he is now , and you can't be afraid to leave me here with him . Why should you be ? If you will lock the door so no one can bother us , I'm sure you will find him as calm when you return as he is now . 
 In any case , I'll take care of him until you get back , and then we will move him right away . Both Mr . Lorry and Defarge thought this was a bad idea and thought one of them should stay . But someone needed to find a carriage and horses and traveling papers . The day was almost over , and they were running out of time . The two men finally decided to divide up these tasks between them , and they hurried off to do them . 
 As it grew dark , the young woman lay her head down on the hard ground next to her father and watched him . It got darker and darker , and they both lay there quietly until a light shone through the cracks in the wall . Mr . Lorry and Monsieur Defarge had made all the arrangements for the journey . They had brought traveling cloaks and blankets , as well as bread and meat , wine , and hot coffee . Monsieur Defarge put these items , and the lamp he was carrying , on the shoemaker's bench (there was no other furniture in the attic except for a simple bed) . He and Mr . Lorry woke up the old man and helped him to his feet . 
 No one would have been able to tell from the blank , frightened look on his face what the man might have been thinking . No one would have been able to tell if he knew what had happened earlier , if he remembered what they had said to him , or if he knew that he was free . They tried speaking to him , but he was so confused and slow to answer that they worried he was incoherent and decided to leave him alone . He kept grabbing his head in his hands wildly in a way that he had not been doing before . Yet , he seemed pleased by the sound of his daughter's voice and would turn toward her when she spoke . 
 In the way of a man used to obeying orders , he ate and drank what they gave him , and put on the cloak and other clothes they gave him to wear . He happily let his daughter link arms with him and held her hand with both of his . They began to go downstairs , Monsieur Defarge going first with the lamp and Mr . Lorry coming last . They hadn't gone many steps down the long main staircase when the old man stopped and looked around at the roof and walls . 
 Do you remember this place , father ? Do you remember coming up here ? What did you say ? But before she could repeat the question , he mumbled an answer . Do I remember ? No , I don't remember . It was such a long time ago . It was clear that he had no memory of being brought from the prison to the house . They heard him mumble , One Hundred and Five , North Tower , and he looked around , apparently searching for the prison walls that had held him captive for so long . 
 When they reached the courtyard he instinctively changed his stride , as if he were expecting to come upon a drawbridge . When there was no drawbridge and he saw the carriage waiting in the street , he let go of his daughter's hand and grabbed his head again . No crowd was gathered around the door . No one could be seen at any of the many windows . No one even happened to be walking by on the street . Everything was strangely silent . Only one person could be seen , and that was Madame Defarge . She leaned against the doorframe , knitting and pretending to see nothing . 
 Monsieur Manette got into a coach and his daughter followed him . Mr . Lorry was about to get in when the old man asked pitifully for his shoemaking tools and unfinished shoes . Madame Defarge yelled to her husband that she would get them . Still knitting , she went out of the lamplight and through the courtyard . She brought them back quickly and passed them into the coach , and then she immediately went back to leaning against the doorframe , knitting and pretending to see nothing . Defarge climbed up on the coach and yelled , To the barrier ! The driver cracked his whip , and the coach drove off under the dim swinging streetlamps . 
 They drove through the streets under the swinging streetlamps , which were brighter in the richer neighborhoods and dimmer in the poorer ones . They passed well-lit shops and coffee houses , festive crowds , and theaters , until they arrived at one of the city gates . There they came upon some soldiers with lanterns at a guardhouse . Give us your papers , travelers ! See here then , Monsieur Officer , said Defarge , getting down from the coach and taking the soldier aside . These papers belong to the white-haired man inside . They were put in my care , along with the man , at the He lowered his voice . There was some movement among the soldiers' lanterns , and one of the soldiers shined his lantern inside the coach . The soldier looked carefully at the white-haired old man . 
 Beneath the starssome so far from earth that experts tell us their light may not have even reached us yetthe shadows of the night were large and black . All through the cold and restless night they whispered in the ears of Mr . Jarvis Lorry , as he sat across from the man who had been buried and then dug out . He wondered how much of Monsieur Manette's senses had been lost forever , and how much of them he could get back . The shadows whispered the same question as before :  
 Tellson's Bank near Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place , even back in 1780 . It was very small , very dark , very ugly , and very uncomfortable . The partners who ran the bank were old-fashioned too . They were proud of its smallness , darkness , ugliness , and discomfort . They even boasted that their bank was all these things , and they believed that it if hadn't been so unpleasant , it wouldn't have been so well respected . The bankers liked to brag about this to their competitors . 
 The old men who worked in the cramped quarters of Tellson's Bank took their work seriously . When the bank hired a young man , they hid him away until he was old . When they hired a young man at Tellson's London office , they kept him in a dark place and aged him , like a cheese , until he had the Tellson-flavor and mold grew on him . Only then was he allowed to be seen there , studying large books and strutting around with an air of self-importance . 
 Outside of the bank was a man who did odd jobs and sometimes acted as a porter or messenger . He never came inside , unless he was called in for a particular purpose . This man was like a living shop sign for the bank . He was always there during business hours unless he was out on an errand . If he was away , his son , a dirty twelve-year-old scamp who looked just like his father , took his place . People knew that the bank put up with this man . The bank always had someone working in this position , and through time and fate , this man had ended up with the job . His last name was Cruncher , and when he was baptized in the easterly parish church of Houndsditch , he had been given the first name of Jerry . 
 It was seven-thirty on a windy March morning in Mr . Cruncher's apartment in Hanging Sword Alley , Whitefriars . The year was Anno Domini The Year of Our Lord Anno Domini 1780 . (Mr . Cruncher always called it Anna Dominoes . Apparently he thought the year of our Lord started the year the game of dominoes was invented by a woman named Anna . )
 Mr . Cruncher's apartment was not in a very good neighborhood . It had only two rooms , and only if a closet with a tiny window counted as one of them . He kept his apartment clean , though . As early as it was this windy March morning , his bedroom was already scrubbed clean , and the cups and saucers were set out for breakfast on a clean white tablecloth . 
 Mr . Cruncher was asleep under a patchwork quilt , like a Harlequin a clown from Italian comedy that wore a costume made up of multicolored patches Harlequin at home . He was sleeping heavily , but little by little he began to toss and turn in bed , with his spiky hair looking like it would tear his sheets to shreds . Finally he sat up and yelled out in frustration : 
 Bust me , if she isn't at it again ! A neatly dressed woman quickly got up off her knees in the corner , with enough speed and fear to show that she was the woman he referred to . What ! said Mr . Cruncher , looking around the bed for his boot . You're at it again , are you ? After shouting at her a second time , her threw his boot at her . His boot was covered in mud , and that mud said a lot about Mr . Cruncher's other ways of making money . While he usually came home after banking hours with clean boots , he often went out again at night , and when he woke up the next morning his boots would be covered with clay . 
 What , said Mr . Cruncher , after he missed her with the boot . What are you up to , you aggravator ? I was only praying . Praying ! You're a nice woman ! What are you doing throwing yourself down on your knees and praying against me ? I'm not praying against you . I was praying for you . No , you weren't . And if you were , I won't be made a fool of . Cruncher then spoke to their son . Your mother's a nice woman , Young Jerry , he said sarcastically , praying that your father will fail . You've got a devoted mother , very religious , kneeling down and praying that the food will be taken away from her only child . 
 Mr . Cruncher's son , who hadn't gotten dressed yet , turned away from his mother . He did not like the fact that his mother was praying that his food be taken away . And how important do you think your prayers are , you arrogant woman ? asked Mr . Cruncher . How much do you think they're worth ? They come from the heart , Jerry . They're only worth what they mean to me . 
 Muttering other phrases like Oh , yes ! You're a religious woman , aren't you ? You would never go against the best interests of your husband and child , would you ? Not you ! and making other such sarcastic comments , Mr . Cruncher went about cleaning his boots and getting ready for work . Meanwhile , his son , whose hair was slightly less spiked than his father's and whose eyes were close together like his father's , watched his mother as he had been told . He kept surprising her by jumping out of his little bedroom where he was washing up and yelling , You were about to kneel down and pray , Mother . Hey ! Father ! and then , after yelling out this false warning , jumping back into the other room again with a grin . 
 Mr . Cruncher was still in a bad mood when he came to eat breakfast . He was particularly angry when Mrs . Cruncher said grace . What are you up to now , aggravator ! Are you at it again ? His wife explained to him that she was only asking for a blessing . Don't do it ! said Mr . Cruncher while he looked around , as if he expected his wife's prayers to make the loaf of bread on the table disappear . I'm not going to let myself be blessed out of house and home . I won't let you bless my food right off of my table . Keep quiet ! 
 Blurry-eyed and sullen , as if he had been up all night at a party that had ended badly , Jerry Cruncher ate his breakfast anxiously , growling over it like an animal . Around nine o'clock he calmed himself down and , making himself as respectable and professional looking as he could , went out to start his day . 
 You could barely call his work skilled labor , even though he liked to describe himself as an honest businessman . His only equipment was a wooden stool made from a broken chair . His son , young Jerry , carried the stool every morning as he walked at his father's side and placed it under the bank window closest to Temple Bar . He would take a handful of straw from the first vehicle that passed and use it to keep his feet warm and dry , and that was where Mr . Cruncher worked . Here at his position , Mr . Cruncher was as familiar to the people in Fleet Street and the Temple Bar area as Temple Bar itself . 
 Jerry took up his position there at 8 : 45 this windy March morning , just in time to tip his three-cornered hat to the oldest clerks of Tellson's Bank as they came into work . His son stood next to him when he wasn't wandering through Temple Bar looking for boys who were smaller than himself to pick on . Jerry and young Jerry , looking very much like each other , silently watched the morning traffic on Fleet Street . Their heads were as close together as each one's eyes were , making them look like a pair of monkeys . 
 One of the regular messengers that worked in the bank poked his head out the door and said : We need a porter ! Hooray , Father ! Here's an early job to start the day with ! Having sent his father off , young Jerry sat on the stool , looked at the straw his father had been chewing on , and thought . My father's fingers are always so rusty ! mumbled young Jerry . Where does he get all that iron rust on him ? He doesn't get any iron rust on him working here at the bank ! 
 You know the Old Bailey street in London where criminals were tried and imprisoned Old Bailey , don't you ? one of the bank's oldest clerks asked Jerry . Ye-es , sir , answered Jerry , warily . I do know the Old Bailey . I thought so . And you know Mr . Lorry . I know Mr . Lorry much better than I know or ever wish to know the Old Bailey . I'm an honest businessman . He answered as if he were a reluctant witness standing trial . Good . Go find the door where they bring the witnesses in , and show the doorman this note for Mr . Lorry . He will let you in . 
 Into the courtroom , sir ? Yes . Into the courtroom . Mr . Cruncher narrowed his eyes , as if his eyes were asking each other , What do you think about this ?  Should I wait for him in court , sir ? Mr . Cruncher asked . I'll tell you . The doorman will pass your note to Mr . Lorry . Get Mr . Lorry's attention and let him know that you're there . Then wait there until he needs you . 
 Is that all , sir ? That's all . He wants a messenger nearby . Your job is to let him know that you're there if he needs you . The elderly clerk folded and addressed the note . Mr . Cruncher watched him in silence until he had sealed the paper . Then he said : I guess they're trying people for forgery this morning ? No . Treason ! That's punishable by quartering dismembering a body into four parts quartering , said Jerry . How barbaric ! It's the law , answered the old clerk , surprised at this comment . The law is the law . It's a harsh law . It's bad enough to kill him , but it's worse to torture him , sir . 
 Nonsense , answered the old clerk . It's a good law . My advice is to take care of your own health , my friend , and let the law take care of itself . It's this damp weather , sir , that affects my health , said Jerry . My job often requires me to be out in wet weather . Well , we all have different ways of earning a living . Some of us have wet jobs and some of us have dry jobs . Here is the letter . Get going . Jerry took the letter . He bowed respectfully to the man , but under his breath he muttered , You're a mean , skinny old man . Jerry told his son where he was going and left for the Old Bailey . 
 Jerry Cruncher walked through the crowd like a man who was used to moving quietly . He found the door he was looking for and handed his letter through it . In those days people paid to see the trials at the Old Bailey , just like they paid to go to the theater or to visit the Bedlam insane asylum . The Old Bailey , however , cost much more , so the doors were well guarded . The only exception was the door through which the criminals entered , which was kept wide open . 
 After a few moments , the doorman reluctantly opened the door a little way and allowed Mr . Jerry Cruncher to squeeze into the courtroom . What case is this ? Jerry whispered to the man next to him . Nothing yet . What case is next ? The treason case . The one where they're going to quarter the man ? Yep ! answered the man excitedly . They'll hang him for a while , and then they'll take him down , cut him open , disembowel him , and burn his intestines right in front of his eyes so he can watch . Then they'll cut his head off and cut his body into four pieces . That's the punishment . If they decide he's guilty , you mean ? asked Jerry . 
 Mr . Cruncher noticed the doorkeeper , who was moving toward Mr . Lorry with the note in his hand . Mr . Lorry was sitting at a table with several gentlemen in wigs . Sitting near them were the prisoner's lawyer , who had a big pile of papers in front of him , and another man who had his hands in his pockets and kept looking at the ceiling . Jerry got Mr . Lorry's attention by coughing loudly and gesturing a few times . Mr . Lorry , who had stood up to look for him , nodded to Jerry and then sat down again . 
 What's he got to do with this case ? the man next to Jerry asked about Mr . Lorry . I have no idea , said Jerry . What do you have to do with it , if I may ask ? I don't know that either , said Jerry . The judge entered and everyone in the court got settled . Jerry and the man stopped talking . Everyone focused their attention on the dock , where the prisoner was to stand trial . Two jailers who had been standing there went out of the room . They came back with the prisoner and brought him to the bar . 
 Everyone stared at him except for the wigged gentleman who was still staring at the ceiling . People peeked around pillars and corners to get a glimpse of him . Those in the back rows stood up for a better look . People standing on the ground floor stood on their tiptoes or tried to push themselves up on other people's shoulders . 
 They were all staring at a young man about twenty-five years old , tall and good-looking , with sunburned cheeks and dark eyes . He looked like a young gentleman . He was dressed plainly in black or very dark gray . His hair was long and dark and was tied in a ribbon at the back of his neck , more to keep it out of his face than for the sake of fashion . Although he was sunburned , his cheeks were pale from nervousness . Otherwise , he appeared confident . He bowed to the judge and stood quietly . 
 The way the crowd ogled the man was not flattering for the human race . If his sentence wasn't such a horrible oneif there were any chance that he would be spared from any of the terrible things that were set to happen to himpeople would have lost interest . People had come to see the body that was soon to be horribly mutilated , butchered , and torn to pieces . Whatever these people told themselves as to why they were there , the truth was they were there out of a morbid fascination . 
 The prisoner didn't flinch or act out in any way , although he knew that every person in the courtroom was already picturing him being hanged , beheaded , and cut into pieces . He stood quietly , paying close attention to the court proceedings . He rested his hands on the slab of wood in front of him . He was so calm that he didn't disturb the vinegar and herbs , which had been scattered throughout the courtroom to protect everyone against disease . 
 A mirror hung over the prisoner's head to reflect light down onto him . Over the years this mirror had reflected the images of many poor and wicked prisoners who had eventually been put to death . If that mirror were ever able to send those reflections back out , the courtroom would have been filled with ghosts . The prisoner may have thought about how disgraceful it was to have this mirror there . He shifted and a shaft of light shining across his face made him look up . When he saw his reflection , he blushed and brushed the herbs off of the bar in front of him . 
 As he made this gesture , he turned his face to his left . His eyes fell upon two people sitting near the judge's bench . His expression changed so much when he saw them that everyone who was watching turned to look . 
 The two people were a young lady a little older than twenty years old and a gentleman who was apparently her father . He was a remarkable-looking man with white hair and an indescribable intensity in his face . This intense expression made him look like an old man . But when the expression left his face , as it had now while he talked to his daughter , he looked handsome and in the prime of his life . 
 His daughter sat arm in arm with her father . Her fear and pity for the prisoner had made her pull close to him . The expression on her forehead revealed her compassion for the prisoner . This expression was so heartbreaking that it moved even those people who had had no pity for the prisoner . The crowd whispered to one another , Who are they ? 
 Jerry , who had been observing the scene while he sucked the rust off of his fingers , leaned in to hear who they were . The crowd around him had passed the question forward to the person closest to the two people . The answer was slowly passed back until it got to Jerry : They are witnesses . For which side ? asked Jerry . Against . Against which side ? Against the prisoner . The judge turned to look at the two witnesses and called them to the stand . Then he leaned back in his chair and looked at the prisoner . The attorney general stood to state his case , to prove the man guilty and send him to his death .
