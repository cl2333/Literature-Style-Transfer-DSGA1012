 It's the same everywhere , complained the man . No one has any lunch . 
 He took out a blackened pipe , filled it , and lit it with flint and steel . He puffed on it until it was glowing brightly , then suddenly held it away from him . He took something between his finger and thumb and dropped it into the pipe . It blazed and went out in a puff of smoke . 
 Touch then . This time the repairer of roads said it after watching the man put the object in his pipe . They joined hands again . 
 Tonight ? asked the repairer of roads . 
 Tonight , said the man , putting his pipe in his mouth . 
 Where ? 
 Here . 
 He and the repairer of roads sat on the pile of stones looking silently at each other . The hail was falling between them like tiny bayonets , and then the sky began to clear over the village . 
 Show me ! said the man , moving up the hill . 
 See ! answered the repairer of roads , pointing with his finger . You go down here , and straight through the street , and past the fountain
 To hell with that ! interrupted the man , looking over the landscape . I don't go through the streets or past any fountains . Well ? 
 Well ! About two leagues a distance between 2 . 4 and 4 . 6 miles leagues past the top of the hill above the village . 
 Good . When do you finish work ? 
 At sunset . 
 Will you wake me up before you leave ? I have walked two nights without stopping . Let me finish my pipe and I'll sleep like a baby . Will you wake me ? 
 Of course . 
 The traveler smoked the rest of his pipe and put it in his pocket . He took off his big wooden shoes and lay down on his back on the pile of stones . He fell asleep immediately . 
 As the repairer of roads worked his dusty job , the hail clouds moved away to reveal streaks of sky , and the sun gleamed on the landscape . The little repairer of roads , wearing a red cap now instead of his blue one , seemed fascinated by the man sleeping on the heap of stones . He looked toward him so often that he did his work mechanically , and , one might say , badly . The tan face , the shaggy black hair and beard , the coarse wool red cap , the homemade clothes , the hairy skin , the strong frame that had been weakened by poverty , and the way he tightened his lips desperately while he slept , inspired awe in the repairer of roads . The traveler had traveled far , and his feet were sore from walking . His ankles were chafed and bleeding , and his big shoes were stuffed with leaves and grass and must have been heavy to drag over the long distance . There were holes worn in his clothes and sores all over his body . The repairer of roads crouched down beside him and tried to see if he had any weapons hidden in his shirt or anywhere else . But he didn't see any , because the man was sleeping with his arms crossed in front of him as tightly as his lips were closed . Fortress towns with their stockades , guardhouses , gates , trenches , and drawbridges seemed nothing compared to this man . When he turned his eyes to the horizon and looked around , he imagined he saw other similar figures , unstoppable , traveling to villages all over France . 
 The man kept sleeping . He didn't notice the showers of hail and periods of sunshine , the sunlight or shadow on his face , the lumps of ice on his body , and the diamond shapes the sun melted them into . The sun was low in the west and the sky was glowing . Then the repairer of roads was ready to go down to the village , so he gathered his tools and all his things and woke the man up . 
 Good ! said the traveler , lifting himself up on his elbows . Two leagues past the top of the hill ? 
 About that . 
 About that . Good ! 
 The repairer of roads went home with dust blowing ahead of him to wherever the wind took it . Soon he was at the fountain , joining the group of thin cows that had been brought there to drink , and even appearing to whisper to them . When the people in the village had eaten their small suppers , they didn't go to bed as usual , but came outside again and stayed there . A strange amount of whispering was going on , and when the crowd gathered around the fountain in the dark , they started looking at the sky in one particular direction . Monsieur Gabelle , the chief official of the area , became anxious . He went out on his rooftop alone and looked in the same direction as the crowd . He glanced down from behind his chimneys at the faces in the dark by the fountain below . Then he sent a message to the sacristan , who had the keys to the church , that they might need to ring the tocsin alarm bell tocsin soon . 
 The night grew darker . The trees surrounding the old chateau , which kept it isolated , moved in a rising wind , as though they were threatening the chateau in the dark . The rain poured down the two flights of steps to the terrace and beat at the large front door , like a messenger trying to wake those inside . Wind rushed through the hall among the old spears and knives . With a sighing sound , it went up the stairs and shook the bed curtains where the last marquis had slept . Four disheveled people stomped through the high grass through the woods toward the chateau . They came from all directionseast , west , north , and southand they broke branches as they walked cautiously to meet up in the courtyard . They lit four lights there , then moved off in different directions , and then everything was dark again . 
 But not for long . Soon , a light came on in the chateau , making it visible and appear as if it were glowing . Then a streak of flickering light could be seen behind the front of the building . It moved past balustrades , arches , and windows , lighting them up . Then it went higher and grew brighter . Soon flames burst out from many of the large windows and the stone faces could be seen staring out of the fire . 
 A faint murmur could be heard from the few people who were left at the chateau . Someone saddled a horse and rode away . There was the sound of someone spurring a horse on and splashing through the dark . The horse , foaming at the mouth from exertion , rode past the village fountain and stopped at Monsieur Gabelle's door . Help , Gabelle ! Help , everyone ! cried the man on the horse . The alarm bell at the church rang , but there was no other help to come . The repairer of roads and two hundred and fifty of his companions stood at the fountain with their arms folded , looking at the pillar of fire in the sky . It must be forty feet high , they said , seriously . They never moved . 
 The rider who had come from the chateau and the tired horse continued through the village . They galloped up the stony hill to the prison on the cliff . At the gate , a group of officers was looking at the fire , and a little ways off was a group of soldiers . Help , officers ! The chateau is on fire ! We might be able to save valuable objects from the flames if we work fast ! Help ! Help ! The officers looked at the soldiers , who were looking at the fire . They didn't give any orders , just shrugged and answered , It has to burn . 
 As the rider went down the hill again and through the street , the village grew brighter . The repairer of roads and two hundred and fifty of his companions , inspired by the fire at the chateau , had hurried into their houses and were putting candles in every little pane of glass in the windows . Since they didn't have much of anything , they decided to force Monsieur Gabelle to lend them some of his candles . When Monsieur Gabelle hesitated to give them the candles , the repairer of roads , who had once been so submissive toward officials , threatened him . He said they could always make a fire with Gabelle's carriages and roast his post horses . 
 The chateau was left alone to burn . In the raging fire , a hot wind , issuing from the fire , seemed to be blowing the building away . The stone faces looked as if they were being tortured as the flames rose and fell . Large pieces of stone and wood fell , covering the face with the two dents that resembled the marquis . It became visible again , as if the marquis were being burned at the stake and were struggling with the fire . 
 The chateau burned down , and the trees closest to it also caught on fire and shriveled up . Trees far away , set on fire by the four fierce figures who had set fire to the chateau , sent more smoke to surround the building . Molten lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain , and the water dried up . The tower's tops , which looked like candle extinguishers , disappeared like ice in heat and melted into the flames . Huge splits and cracks appeared in the walls , as if it were crystallizing , and confused birds flew around in circles and fell into the furnace . The four fierce figures walked away in four different directionseast , west , north , and southalong the dark roads . The light they had used to set the fire guided them toward their destinations . The village , which was lit up with candles , had taken over the alarm bell , and getting rid of the official ringer , the villagers rang the bell for joy . 
 Moreover , the people of the village were giddy with hunger , fire , and the ringing of the bell now . They started to think that Monsieur Gabelle collected their rent and taxes , even though in those later days it was only a small amount of taxes and no rent at all . They wanted to talk to him right away . They surrounded his house and told him to come out and talk to them . Monsieur Gabelle barred his door and stayed inside by himself . He went to his rooftop and hid behind his chimneys . He decided that if they broke his door down (he was a small man from the South with a vengeful personality) that he would throw himself headfirst over the edge and try to crush a person or two below as he fell . 
 Monsieur Gabelle must have spent a long night up on his roof , with the burning chateau providing his light , the banging on his door , and the ringing of the alarm bell . Not to mention the fact that on the road in front of his posting house gate hung a streetlamp , which the village wanted to replace with his hanging corpse . It was a stressful situation , to be spending an entire summer night on the brink of death , waiting to jump off his roof ! But dawn finally appeared and the candles in the village burned out . The people all left , and Monsieur Gabelle came down from his roof , still alive for the time being . 
 Less than a hundred miles away , there were other fires burning and other local officials who weren't as lucky as Monsieur Gabelle . That night and other nights , when the sun rose , these officials were found hanging in the once-peaceful streets , where they had been born and raised . Also , there were other villagers and townspeople less fortunate than the repairer of roads and his companions , whom the officials and soldiers defeated and hanged . Regardless , the four fierce figures who had lit the fire were steadily making their way in four different directionseast , west , north , and southand wherever someone was hanged , fire burned . How many people would have to die to satisfy them no official could say . 
 Three years went by , and the violence in France grew worse and worse without stop , while the people around it watched in terror and wonder . Little Lucie Manette had three more birthdays in her peaceful home . 
 The people at the Manette home had listened to the echoes in the street corner many days and nights , and their hearts would stop when they heard the crowd of footsteps . The footsteps now sounded like the footsteps of the French people , who had declared their turbulent country to be in danger and ruled it under the red flag of the Republic . They acted like they had been turned into wild beasts by many years of abuse . 
 The upper class had distanced itself from the fact that it was hated in France . Their presence was so unwanted there that they were in danger of being exiled from the country or even killed . The situation resembled the story of the farmer who worked hard to summon the devil , then became so scared when the devil finally appeared that he ran away before he could ask a question . Likewise , the upper class did much to bring this revolt about , then ran away as soon as they saw it happening . 
 The glittering , bull's-eye-shaped group of Royal Court members was gone , or it would have been a target for the whole country . It had always been oblivious , since it was proud , extravagant , and blind . Now it had disappeared entirely . The whole court , from its exclusive inner circle to the outermost ring of corruption , had also disappeared . The king and queen were gone . They had been overtaken at the palace and were suspended when the last wave of rebellion took it over . 
 August 1792 had come , and the upper class of monseigneurs had by this time fled to many different places . 
 Naturally , Tellson's Bank was the headquarters and gathering place of France's upper class in London . They say that ghosts haunt the places where their bodies used to be , and the upper class , without any money left , haunted the place where its money used to be . Moreover , it was the first place to hear the most reliable news from France . Tellson's was a generous company , and it was very kind to old customers who had fallen on hard times . Those noblemen who had realized in time what was going to happen , and who had expected their valuables to be seized , had transferred much of their wealth to Tellson's . Their unfortunate countrymen always talked about them at Tellson's . It must be added that nearly every new-comer from France reported his arrival and his condition to Tellson's Bank . Consequently , Tellson's was like a stock exchange for French information . This was so well-known , and people came there with so many questions about the events in France , that Tellson's sometimes wrote the latest news out and put it up in the bank's windows for everyone in Temple Bar to read . 
 One steamy afternoon , Mr . Lorry sat at his desk . Charles Darnay stood leaning on it , talking to him quietly . The cell-like room , which had once been for interviews with the head of the bank , was now the newsroom , and it was filled to overflowing with people . It was within half an hour or so of closing time . 
 Even though you are as youthful as the youngest man that ever lived , said Charles Darnay , hesitating , I still have to suggest to you
 I understand . I am too old ? said Mr . Lorry . 
 You will face bad weather , a long journey , unreliable means of traveling , a country in turmoil , and a city that might not even be safe for you . 
 My dear Charles , said Mr . Lorry , with cheerful confidence , these are some of the reasons why I'm going , not why I should stay away . It is safe enough for me . Nobody will want to bother an old man who's almost eighty when there are so many people there that are more worth bothering than me . As far as the city being disorganized , if it were not disorganized there would be no reason to send someone from our office here in London to our office in Paris . Someone who knows the city and the business well and who can be trusted . As far as the uncertain traveling , the long trip , and the winter weather , if I weren't ready to suffer a bit for the sake of Tellson's Bank after all these years , who should be ? 
 I wish I were going myself , said Charles Darnay . He said it restlessly , and as if he were thinking aloud . 
 Really ? You're one to talk ! said Mr . Lorry . You wish you were going yourself ? You're a Frenchman . You're a smart adviser , aren't you ? 
 My dear Mr . Lorry , it is because I'm a Frenchman that the thoughtwhich I didn't mean to say out loud right nowhas occurred to me often . I can't help thinking that I have abandoned the poor people of France , Darnay said in his reasonable manner . They might listen to me , and I might be able to persuade them to restrain themselves . Only last night , after you left us , when I was talking to Lucie
 When you were talking to Lucie , Mr . Lorry repeated . Yes . I'm amazed that you're not ashamed to mention her name ! Wishing you were going to France ! 
 However , I'm not going , said Charles Darnay , with a smile . The point is that you say you're going . 
 The reality is that I am going . The truth is , Charles , Mr . Lorry glanced at the head of the bank and lowered his voice , you have no idea how difficult it is for us to conduct business there . Our records and papers in France are in serious danger . Lord knows what might happen to many people if some of our documents were taken or destroyed . And they might be taken at any time , you know . Who knows if Paris will be set on fire today or ransacked tomorrow ? Now , only I can go there , take a careful selection from these documents , and bury them or otherwise get them out of harm's way . Should I stay here when Tellson's knows this and tells me thisTellson's , where I have worked for sixty yearsbecause I'm a little old ? Why , I am a young boy , sir , compared to a dozen of the old men here ! 
 How I admire your bravery and youthful spirit , Mr . Lorry . 
 Tut ! Nonsense , sir ! And , my dear Charles , said Mr . Lorry , glancing at the head of the bank again , remember that getting anything out of Paris right now , no matter what it is , is almost impossible . Some papers and important matters were brought here just today by the strangest people you could imagine , all of whom could have been seized and had their heads chopped off as they passed through the barriers out of France . (I'm telling you this in secretit is unprofessional for me to whisper about it , even to you . ) Any other time our packages would come and go as easily as they would here in England . Now , everything has stopped . 
 And are you really leaving tonight ? 
 I'm really leaving tonight . The situation has become too urgent for me to delay . 
 And you aren't taking anyone with you ? 
 Many different people have been suggested to me , but I don't want any of them . I plan to take Jerry . Jerry has been my bodyguard on Sunday nights for a long time and I'm used to him . Nobody will suspect Jerry of being anything but an English ruffian , or of having any idea in his head but to attack anyone who harms me . 
 I have to say again that I admire your bravery and youthfulness . 
 I say again that's nonsense ! When I have completed this little task , maybe I will accept Tellson's offer to retire and live the easy life . I'll have enough time then to think about growing old . 
 This conversation had taken place at Mr . Lorry's desk . There were people of the French upper-class gathered within a yard or two of it , bragging about what they would soon do to avenge themselves on the peasants . It was just like these upper-class refugees , and just like the way of the British , to talk about this terrible Revolution as if it had come from nowhereas if nothing had ever been done , or had not been done , to cause it . As if no one had seen millions of poor people in France suffering , or seen their resources , which should have made them prosperous , squandered . As if no one had seen it coming for years and had even written down what they saw . Such worthless talk , combined with the extravagant plans of the upper class to restore France to its former , unsustainable condition , was hard for any sane person who knew the truth to listen to . It was this kind of nonsense , like the conflict in his head and an uneasiness in his mind , that had made Charles Darnay restless , and that kept him restless now . 
 Mr . Stryver of the King's Bench bar was among the people talking . He was well on his way to getting a state promotion , and therefore was talking loudly on the subject . He was explaining to the monseigneurs his plan to blow up the peasants of France and exterminate them from the face of the earth . He wanted to go on without them , and he would eliminate them like you would exterminate eagles by sprinkling salt on their tails . Darnay was particularly offended by Mr . Stryver's comments , and he felt torn between leaving so that he wouldn't hear any more or staying and joining the conversation when something happened . 
 The head of the bank approached Mr . Lorry and put a dirty , unopened letter in front of him . He asked if Mr . Lorry had found the person to whom it had been addressed . The head of the bank laid the letter down so close to Darnay that he could see the name , and he noticed it immediately because it was his own name . The address , translated into English , was : 
 Very urgent . To monsieur formerly known as the Marquis St . Evremonde of France . Care of Tellson and Co . Bank , London , England . 
 On the morning Charles and Lucie got married , Dr . Manette had made one request of Darnay : that the secret of Darnay's real name should be kept between the two of them , unless the doctor decided otherwise . Nobody else knew that it was Darnay's name . Even Charles's wife , Lucie , had no idea about it , and Mr . Lorry couldn't know . 
 No , said Mr . Lorry , answering the head of the bank . I think I have asked everybody here , and no one can tell me where to find this gentleman . 
 It was almost closing time at the bank , and the group that was talking passed by Mr . Lorry's desk . He held out the letter to them to see if they knew the name . One after another , the monseigneurs all looked at it resentfully . They all had something disapproving to say , in French or in English , about this scheming , offensive refugee marquis that no one could find . 
 He's the nephew , I believe , or at least the unworthy successor , of the elegant marquis who was murdered , said one of them . I'm happy to say I never knew him . 
 He's a coward who abandoned his post some years ago , said another . This particular man had snuck out of Paris upside down , almost suffocating , in a load of hay . 
 He was infected with new thought , said a third , looking at the address though a magnifying glass . He opposed the last marquis , abandoned the estates when he inherited them , and left them to the peasants . I hope the peasants will pay him back as he deserves . 
 Hey ? yelled Stryver . Did he ? Is that the kind of man he is ? Let's look at his infamous name . Damn the fellow ! 
 Darnay wasn't able to restrain himself any longer . He touched Mr . Stryver on the shoulder and said : 
 I know the man . 
 Do you , by Jupiter ? said Stryver . I'm sorry to hear that . 
 Why ? 
 Why , Mr . Darnay ? Didn't you hear what he did ? Don't ask why in these times . 
 But I am asking why . 
 Then I'll tell you again , Mr . Darnay . I am sorry that you know him . I am sorry to hear you asking such extraordinary questions . Here is a man who has been infected by the most diseased , offensive beliefs . He abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the earthmurderous peasants . And you ask me why I'm sorry that you , a teacher to children , knows him ? Well , I'll answer you . I'm sorry because I believe that such a scoundrel spreads disease . That's why . 
 Remembering his secret , Mr . Darnay struggled to keep himself under control . He said , Maybe you don't understand the gentleman . 
 I understand how to win an argument , Mr . Darnay , said the bullying Mr . Stryver . And I'll do it . If this fellow is a gentleman , I don't understand him . You can tell him so with my compliments . You can also tell him from me that after he gave up his property and title to this mob of butchers , I'm surprised he's not leading the mob himself . But , no , gentlemen , said Stryver , looking around and snapping his fingers , I know something about human nature , and I tell you that you'll never find a man like this man trusting the peasants he claims to sympathize with . No , gentlemen , he'll always turn and run away very early in a fight . 
 With those words , Mr . Stryver snapped his fingers a last time and shoved his way out into Fleet Street . The group around him who had been listening cheered and applauded , and Mr . Lorry and Charles Darnay were left alone at the desk as the bank emptied out . 
 Will you take the letter ? said Mr . Lorry . You know where to deliver it ? 
 I do . 
 Will you explain that we think it was addressed here in the hopes that we would know where to forward it , and that it has been here for quite some time ? 
 I will . Are you leaving for Paris from here ? 
 From here at eight o'clock . 
 I will come back to see you off . 
 Darnay was very unhappy with himself , and with Stryver and the other men . He made his way into Temple Bar , opened the letter , and read it . It said : 
 From Abbaye Prison , Paris
 June 21 , 1792
 To monsieur formerly known as the marquis . 
 After having my life threatened by the villagers , I have been taken with great violence and humiliation and forced to walk a long distance to Paris . On the road I have suffered very much , and that's not all . My house has also been destroyed . 
 The crime they have imprisoned me for , former marquis , is treason against the people . I'll be brought to stand trial in front of the tribunal and executed if you do not help me . They say that I have worked against them for an emigrant someone who leaves his native country to live somewhere else emigrant . I have been unable to convince them that I was working for them , not against them , according to your instructions . I have been unable to convince them that , before your property was taken away , I paid off the taxes they had stopped paying , that I had stopped collecting rent from them . Their only response to this was that I was acting on behalf of you , an emigrant . They demanded to know where you were . 
 Oh ! You , the former marquis , where are you ? I yell out in my sleep ëWhere is he ? ' I ask Heaven if you will come and help me . But there is no answer . Oh , you , the former marquis , I have sent this message across the sea , hoping that you will find it at Tellson's Bank and help me ! 
 For the love of Heaven , justice , generosity , and the honor of your noble family name , I beg you , former marquis , to help release me from prison . My crime is that I have been faithful to you , and I pray that you will be faithful to me ! 
 From this horrible prison , where every hour brings me closer to my death , I pledge my sad faith , former marquis . 
 Your suffering servant , 
 Gabelle . 
 The letter awoke Darnay's uneasiness . The fact that his good , old servant , whose only crime was being faithful to Darnay and his family , was in trouble made him feel ashamed . As he walked back and forth in Temple Bar thinking about what to do , he almost hid is face in shame from the people walking by . 
 He knew very well that he had made mistakes . He had acted imperfectly in his handling of his family's bad deeds and bad reputation , in his resentful suspicions toward his uncle , and in his dislike for France's crumbling social fabric . He knew that , although giving up his privileged place in society had long been on his mind , the way he had done it was hurried and incomplete because he had fallen in love with Lucie . He had meant to spend more time working it out and supervising it , but had never done so . 
 He knew that he had been distracted by the happiness of the life he had chosen in England , the necessity of having to work all the time , and the speed with which the troubles came about in France . The situation kept changing , and his plans kept changing with it . He knew that he had given into these circumstances , and though he had been concerned , he had been busy with other things . He had watched the events in France and waited for a time to act . Now it was too late . The nobles were leaving France by every road and highway , their property was being taken away or destroyed , and their family names were being erased . Darnay knew all of this as well as any of the people now ruling France knew it , and those people might hold him responsible for some of it . 
 But he hadn't hurt anyone , and he hadn't imprisoned anyone . He was so far from having cruelly forced the peasants to pay taxes to him that he had given up his social position of his own free will . Instead he had gone out into the world without the advantage of his title to earn a living for himself . Monsieur Gabelle had taken care of the poor and complex estate under written orders . He was told to spare the people , to give them what little there was leftwhatever fuel the tax collectors would let them have during the winter and whatever food was left during summer . He had put it all in writing so that there would be proof if he needed it now . 
 This started to persuade Charles Darnay that he needed to go back to Paris . 
 Yes . Like the mariner in the old story The Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Samuel Coleridge mariner in the old story , he was being pulled back as if to a magnet . He had to go back to France . Everything he thought of inspired him to move faster and more steadily toward France . He had been worried that bad people were making the situation bad in France . As someone who knew better than them , he should be there trying to stop the bloodshed and convincing them to be merciful and humane . With this uneasiness , half suppressed and half reprimanding him , he ended up comparing himself to Gabelle , the old gentleman who had been so dedicated to him . Immediately after this he thought of the sneers of his uncle , the monseigneur , which had stung him so badly , and Stryver's comments , which bothered him most of all . Then he thought of Gabelle's letter : the plea of an innocent prisoner who could be executed and have his justice , honor , and good name die with him . 
 He made his decision . He had to go to Paris . 
 Yes . The Loadstone Rock magnetite or something that acts as a magnet Loadstone Rock was drawing him , and he had to go toward it until he returned to France . He didn't know that there was danger waiting for him there . He thought the people in France would happily understand the reason why he had done what he did once he arrived to explain himself . He thought of the good deed he had tried to do , which is often the optimistic illusion of many good people , and he saw himself as someone who could help to lead the Revolution that had gotten so out of control . 
 As he walked back and forth , having made his decision , he thought that neither Lucie nor her father should know about it until he had already left . Lucie should be spared the pain of saying goodbye , and her father , who was always reluctant to think about his past , should find it out as something that had already happened . He shouldn't have to deal with the suspense of not knowing whether Charles would go . Darnay wouldn't reflect on how much his doubts about going were because of her father . But Dr . Manette's circumstances also affected his decision . 
 He walked back and forth thinking , until it was time to go back to Tellson's and send off Mr . Lorry . As soon as he arrived in Paris he would find Mr . Lorry again , but he wouldn't say anything about his plans now . 
 A carriage with post horses was waiting at the door of the bank , and Jerry was there dressed and ready . 
 I have delivered that letter , said Charles Darnay to Mr . Lorry . I wouldn't let him give me a written answer , but will you take a verbal answer ? 
 I will , happily , said Mr . Lorry , if it's not dangerous . 
 It's not dangerous at all , though it is to a prisoner at the Abbaye Prison . 
 What's his name ? said Mr . Lorry . He had his pocketbook in his hand . 
 Gabelle . 
 Gabelle . And what is the message to the unlucky prisoner Gabelle ? 
 It's simply that ëhe has received the letter and will come . '
 At a specific time ? 
 He will leave tomorrow night . 
 Any particular person ? 
 No . 
 He helped Mr . Lorry wrap himself in several coats and cloaks and went out with him from the warm , old bank into the cold misty air of Fleet Street . Give my love to Lucie and little Lucie , said Mr . Lorry , as they said goodbye . And take good care of them until I come back . Charles Darnay shook his head and smiled uncertainly as the carriage rolled away . 
 It was the fourteenth of August , and that night Darnay sat up late and wrote two passionate letters . One was to Lucie , explaining his need to go to Paris and assuring her that he would not come to any harm there . The other letter was to the doctor , telling him to take care of Lucie and their daughter , and reassuring him as well that he would be fine . To both of them he wrote that he would send them letters to let them know he was safe as soon as he arrived . 
 It was hard being with them that day , with the first worries of their married life on his mind . It was hard to keep the secret that they had no suspicions of . But a loving look to his happy , busy wife convinced him not to tell her what was about to happen . (He had almost been moved to tell her ; it was so strange to do anything without her quiet help) . The day went by quickly , and early in the evening he embraced her and their daughter , pretending that he would come back soon (he told them he had an appointment and had to go out , and he had snuck out a suitcase full of clothes) . Then he went out into the heavy mist in the streets with a heavy heart . 
 The magnet was drawing him quickly back to France now , and the winds and tides were heading toward it . He left his two letters with a trustworthy porter and told him to deliver them half an hour before midnight , but no sooner . He took a horse to Dover and started his journey . For the love of Heaven , justice , generosity , and of the honor of your family name ! was what Gabelle , the poor prisoner , had said . Darnay recalled these words , which gave him strength as he left all that he loved on earth behind him , and sailed back toward France . 
 The end of Book Two . 
 It took a traveler a long time to go from England to Paris in the fall of 1792 . There were many bad roads , bad carriages , and bad horses that would have delayed him , even though the king of France was still ruling on the throne in all of his glory . Now that the times had changed , there were even more obstacles . Citizen-patriots with their muskets ready to fire had taken over every town gate and village taxing-house . They would stop everyone as they came and went , question them , examine their papers , and look for their names on their lists . They would make them turn back or send them on their way , and sometimes they would stop them and seize them . It all depended on what their impulsive judgment led them to believe was best for the new Republic , which had the slogan , One and Indivisible , with Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death . 
 Charles Darnay had only traveled a few leagues into France when he began to notice that there was no hope of his going back until he had been declared a good citizen in Paris . Whatever might happen to him now , he had to continue on to his destination . He knew that every village and barrier he passed through was another obstacle between him and England . He was watched so carefully that he wouldn't have felt more like a prisoner even if he had been caught in a net , or were being sent to his destination in a cage . 
 Being watched so carefully not only meant that he was stopped on the highway twenty times during each leg of his journey , but he was also slowed down twenty times a day . People would follow him and then make him go back , or they would ride ahead of him and stop him , or ride with him and keep watch over him . He had been traveling in France for several days when he went to bed exhausted in a little town on a road still far away from Paris . 
 If he hadn't shown them poor Gabelle's letter from Abbaye Prison , he would not have gotten that far . He had so much trouble at the guardhouse in this small town that he thought he was in danger . Because of this he was especially surprised when he was woken up in the small inn where he was staying in the middle of the night . 
 A timid local official and three armed patriots with rough red caps and pipes in their mouths woke him . They sat down on the bed . 
 Emigrant , said the official , I am going to send you to Paris with an escort . 
 Citizen , I want nothing more than to get to Paris , though I don't need an escort . 
 Quiet ! said one of the men in the red caps , hitting the bedcover with the handle of his musket . Quiet , aristocrat ! 
 What this man says is true , said the timid official . You are an aristocrat and so you need an escort . And you must pay us for it . 
 I have no choice , said Charles Darnay . 
 Choice ! Listen to him ! yelled the same angry man in the red cap . As if we weren't doing him a favor by keeping him from being hanged from a streetlamp ! 
 What this patriot says is always right , said the official . Get up and get dressed , emigrant . 
 Darnay did as he was told . He was taken back to the guardhouse where other patriots in rough red caps were smoking , drinking , and sleeping by a campfire . He paid them a great deal of money to be his escort , and then they started out on the wet roads at three o'clock in the morning . 
 The escort was made up of two patriots in red caps and three-colored cockades an ornament worn on a hat as a badge cockades . They were armed with muskets and sabers and rode along on horses on either side of him . 
 Charles Darnay controlled his own horse , but a loose rope was tied to the bridle . One of the escorts kept the end of the rope tied around his wrist . They headed out this way with the rain hitting their faces , clattering at a quick trot over the uneven paved street of the town and out onto the muddy roads . They occasionally changed horses or changed the pace at which they were traveling , but otherwise nothing changed during the whole muddy journey to Paris . 
 They traveled at night , stopping an hour or two after daybreak and waiting until twilight to start again . The escorts were dressed so poorly that they wrapped straw around their bare legs and their shoulders to keep from getting wet . Besides the inconvenience of having the escort , and the danger of one of the escorts always being drunk and carrying his musket in a reckless way , Charles Darnay didn't fear being treated as a captive . It had nothing to do with his particular situation , he thought . He hadn't explained why he was there yet , and he knew his story could be confirmed by Gabelle , the prisoner at the Abbaye Prison . 
 They came to the town of Beauvais in the evening . The streets were filled with people , and now Darnay couldn't help thinking that things looked upsetting . A threatening crowd gathered to see him dismount from his horse at the posting yard . Many people yelled out loudly , Down with the emigrant ! 
 He stopped as he was getting out of his saddle and decided that it was safer to stay on his horse . 
 You call me an emigrant , my friends ? Don't you see that I'm here in France by my own choice ? 
 You are a cursed emigrant , yelled a farrier someone who makes horseshoes farrier . The man rushed at him through the crowd waving his hammer in his hand . And you are a cursed aristocrat ! 
 The postmaster got between the man and the rider's bridle , which is what the man was apparently moving toward . He said soothingly , Leave him alone ! He will be judged in Paris . 
 Judged ! repeated the farrier , swinging his hammer . Yes , and he'll be condemned as a traitor . At this the crowd roared in approval . 
 The drunken escort sat calmly in his saddle watching with the rope around his wrist . Darnay looked at the postmaster , who was trying to turn the horse's head toward the yard . As soon as he could make himself heard , he said : 
 Friends , you are mistaken . Or you have been misinformed . I am not a traitor . 
 He lies ! yelled the farrier . He is a traitor since they made the decree . His cursed life doesn't belong to him anymore . His life belongs to the people of France ! 
 Darnay saw hatred in the eyes of the crowd . In another moment they would have charged at him . The postmaster turned his horse into the yard . The escort rode close beside him , and the postmaster shut and barred the double gates . The farrier hit the gates with his hammer and the crowd groaned but did nothing else . 
 What decree was the smith talking about ? Darnay asked the postmaster after he had thanked him and stood next to him in the yard . 
 It's a decree for selling property of emigrants . 
 When was it passed ? 
 On the fourteenth . 
 That's the day I left England ! 
 Everybody says it is just one of many , and that there will be more decrees , if there aren't already , that will banish all emigrants and condemn them to death if they return . That's what he meant when he said your life is no longer your own . 
 But there are no decrees like that yet ? 
 I don't know , said the postmaster , shrugging his shoulders . There might be , or there will be . What difference does it make ? 
 They rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night , and then they continued riding on while all the townspeople were asleep . Darnay saw many changes in his former country that made his journey feel unreal , and one of the biggest was how little people slept . After riding for long , lonely periods of time over dreary roads , they would see a group of poor cottages that weren't dark like the others but were all lit up . They would find people gathered together like ghosts in the middle of the night . They would be in a circle , holding hands around a shriveled tree of liberty , or all gathered together singing a liberty song . Luckily , though , everyone was sleeping in Beauvais that night , so they were able to leave and continue on their lonely journey . Their horses jingled as they traveled through the unusually cold , wet night and among the poor fields that had given no crops that year . They saw blackened remains of houses that had been burned down . Sometimes they would suddenly be ambushed and have galloping toward them the patriot patrols that were watching all the roads . 
 At daylight they were finally at the walls of Paris . The barrier was closed and guarded by many men when they rode up to it . 
 Where are the prisoner's papers ? asked a resolute-looking man in charge , who was called out by the guard . 
 Charles Darnay naturally noticed their use of the word prisoner . He asked the man to recognize that he was a free traveler and a French citizen . He told him that the dangerous situation in the country made it necessary for him to travel with an escort , and that he had paid these men to escort him . 
 Where are the prisoner's paper ? repeated the man , ignoring him . 
 The drunken patriot took Darnay's papers out of his cap . Looking over Gabelle's letter , the same man in charge seemed surprised . He looked at Darnay carefully . 
 He left Darnay and the escorts without saying a word and went into the guardroom . They sat on their horses and waited for him outside the gate . As he looked around while waiting anxiously , Charles Darnay saw that the gate was being guarded by a combination of soldiers and citizens , with citizens far outnumbering the soldiers . While the entrance into the city for peasants with carts full of supplies and other such traffic was easy to get though , the exit , even for the poorest peasants , was very difficult . A large group of men and women , not to mention animals and vehicles of various kinds , was waiting to leave . It took so long to check their identification that they moved through the barrier very slowly . Some of these people knew that they had so long to wait before they were questioned that they were lying on the ground sleeping or smoking . Others chatted together or hung around . Every man and woman wore a red cap and a three-colored cockade . 
 After Darnay had waited on his horse for half an hour noticing these things , the same man in charge came out and told the guard to open the barrier . Then he gave the drunken sober escorts a receipt for Darnay and asked Darnay to get down off his horse . He did so , and the two escorts , leading Darnay's tired horse , turned and rode away without entering the city . 
 He went with the guard into a guardroom . It smelled of wine and cigarette smoke , and there were several soldiers and citizens there , standing or lying around . Some were sleeping , some were awake , some were drunk , and some were sober . Some were in various states between asleep and awake , or drunk and sober . The light in the guardhouse came partly from the fading oil lamps and partly from the overcast day . Some books of lists were lying open on a desk , and a rough , dark-looking officer was in charge of these . 
 Citizen Defarge , the officer said to the guard escorting Darnay as he took out a slip of paper to write on . Is this the emigrant Evremonde ? 
 This is the man . 
 How old are you , Evremonde ? 
 Thirty-seven . 
 Are you married , Evremonde ? 
 Yes . 
 Where were you married ? 
 In England . 
 Of course you were . Where is your wife , Evremonde ? 
 She is in England . 
 Of course she is . You will be sent to La Force Prison , Evremonde . 
 By Heaven ! exclaimed Darnay . Under what law , and for what crime ? 
 The officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment . 
 We have new laws , Evremonde , and new crimes , since you were last in France . He smiled cruelly as he said it and continued writing . 
 Please know that I have come here by my own choice , in response to that letter you have in front of you . A fellow countryman begged me to return and help him . All I want is the chance to do so as soon as possible . Isn't that my right ? 
 Emigrants have no rights , Evremonde , the man answered coldly . The officer finished writing . He read over to himself what he had written , sealed it , and handed it to Defarge , telling him , In secret . 
 Defarge gestured to Darnay with the paper that he had to follow him . Darnay obeyed , and two armed citizens went with them . 
 Are you the one who married the daughter of Dr . Manette , who was once a prisoner in the Bastille but was released ? asked Defarge quietly as they went down the guardhouse steps and walked out into the streets of Paris . 
 Yes , answered Darnay , with a surprised look . 
 My name is Defarge . I own a wine shop in the Saint Antoine Quarter . Maybe you have heard of me . 
 My wife came to your house to take back her father ? Yes ! 
 The word wife caused Defarge to say suddenly , In the name of that new invention called the guillotine , why did you come back to France ? 
 You heard me say it a minute ago . You don't believe it's the truth ? 
 It's a bad truth for you , said Defarge , speaking with a frown and looking straight ahead . 
 Truly I feel lost here . Everything is so new , so different , so sudden and unjust , that I feel lost . Can you help me ? 
 No . Defarge kept looking straight ahead as he spoke . 
 Will you answer one question for me ? 
 Maybe . Depending on what it is . What is it ? 
 In this prison that I am going to so unjustly , will I have some way of communicating with the outside world ? 
 You'll see . 
 Am I going to be shut up there without a trial or any chance to present my case ? 
 You'll see . But , what then ? Other people have been shut up in worse prisons before in the same way . 
 But not by me , Citizen Defarge . 
 Defarge looked at him for an answer . He walked steadily on in silence , and the quieter he became , the less Darnay hoped that Defarge might soften . Therefore , he said quickly : 
 It is very important to meyou know even better than I do how important it isthat I am able to tell Mr . Lorry of Tellson's Bank that I have been thrown into La Force Prison . Mr . Lorry is an English gentleman who is in Paris right now . Will you be able to tell him for me ? 
 I will do nothing for you , said Defarge , stubbornly . My duty is to my country and its people . I have sworn to serve them against people like you . I will do nothing for you . 
 Charles Darnay felt that it was hopeless to beg him anymore , and he was also too proud to do so . As they walked on in silence , he couldn't help noticing how the people seemed to be used to seeing prisoners moving through the streets . Even the children barely noticed him . A few people passing by turned to look at him , and a few shook their fingers at him for being an aristocrat . But otherwise , the fact that a well-dressed man was going to prison was no more special than if a man in work clothes should be going to work . In one narrow , dark , and dirty street that they passed through , an excited speaker was standing on a stool and speaking to an excited audience about crimes against the people of the king and the royal family . The few words that Charles Darnay heard the man say let him know that the king was in prison and that all the foreign ambassadors had left Paris . Except for when he had been in Beauvais , he had heard no news on the road . His escort and the fact that he was so closely watched had isolated him . 
 He knew now that France was a much more dangerous place for him currently than it had been when he had left England . He knew that danger had come upon him quickly and that things might get more and more dangerous for him . He had to admit to himself that he might not have come if he had known what would happen . And yet his concerns weren't as ominous as you would think , looking back on it from this happier time . Troubled as his future was , he didn't know his future . He knew so little about the coming massacrea horrible massacre that would go on for days and nights and that would taint the gathering time of the harvest with bloodshedit could have been a hundred thousand years away . The new invention of the guillotine was hardly known by name to him , or the people of France . The terrible things that would soon be done probably didn't even exist in the minds of the people who would do them yet . How could gentle people imagine such things ? 
 He had expected to be treated harshly and possibly detained . He expected to miss his wife and child . But beyond this , he wasn't afraid of anything specific . These were his thoughts as he arrived at La Force Prison . 
 A man with a swollen face opened a small window in the door of the prison . Defarge told him , This is the emigrant Evremonde . 
 What the devil ! How many more of them are there ? exclaimed the man with the swollen face . 
 Defarge ignored the man's comment and took a receipt from him . He left with the two citizen guards . 
 I say again , what the devil ! exclaimed the jailer to his wife . How many more ? 
 The jailer's wife didn't have an answer for him . She merely said , You have to have patience , my dear ! She rang a bell and three prison guards entered . They said the same thing , and one of them added the phrase For the love of liberty , which was a strange phrase to hear in a prison . 
 La Force Prison was a gloomy place . It was dark and filthy and had the horrible smell of foul sleep . It is extraordinary how soon the offensive smell of imprisoned sleep becomes apparent in places that are poorly cared for . 
 In secret , too , complained the jailer , reading the slip of paper . As if the prison wasn't already full to bursting ! 
 He stuck the paper on a file angrily , and Charles Darnay waited for him for half an hour . Sometimes he would pace back and forth in the holding room , and sometimes he would sit on a stone seat . In either case , he stayed long enough that the chief and his staff remembered him . 
 Come ! said the chief , finally picking up his keys , come with me , emigrant . 
 Another guard took him through the dark corridors and staircases of the prison . Many doors clanged and locked behind them . Finally they came into a large , low room with vaulted ceilings . It was filled with men and women who were prisoners . The women were sitting at a long table , reading , writing , knitting , sewing , and embroidering . The men were mostly standing behind their chairs or wandering up and down the room . 
 Darnay withdrew from these people instinctively , associating prisoners with crime and disgrace . But the greatest unreality of his long ride was now their in front of him , as he saw the refinement and grace of these prisoners , who were all members of the upper class . 
 These refined manners seemed so out of place in the gloom of the prison that Charles Darnay felt as if he were surrounded by ghosts . These ghosts of beauty , stateliness , elegance , pride , frivolity , wit , youth , and age were all waiting here to leave earth . They all looked at him with eyes that had been changed by the death they had died in being imprisoned there . 
 He was so shocked he couldn't move . The jailer was standing at his side , and the other jailers were moving around . They would have looked nice enough under normal conditions , but they looked especially rough contrasted with the sad mothers and beautiful young daughters who were prisoners there : the ghosts of the young flirt , the young beauty and the genteel old woman . This contrast made the feeling that all normalcy had been turned upside down all the stronger . Surely , they were all ghosts . Surely , Darnay's long , strange journey through France was actually a disease that had killed him and brought him to these gloomy shades ! 
 In the name of this group of friends who have all faced the same misfortune , I have the honor of welcoming you to La Force Prison , said a well-dressed and well-spoken gentleman as he came forward . I give you my sympathy for the disaster that has brought you here . May it all soon end happily ! It would be rude to do so elsewhere , but it is not heremay I ask , what is your name and title ? 
 Charles Darnay revived himself and told him the information as well as he could . 
 But I hope that you were not brought here in secret ? said the gentleman as he watched the chief jailer move across the room as he spoke . 
 I don't understand the meaning of the phrase , but I heard them say that I was . 
 Ah , what a pity ! We're sorry to hear that . But be brave . Several people that have been here were brought in secret at first and it didn't last long . Then he raised his voice and spoke to the others . I'm sorry to tell you all this , but he was brought here in secret . 
 The group murmured sympathetically as Charles Darnay walked across the room to a grated door , where the jailer waited for him . Many voicesamong which the soft and compassionate voices of women were noticeablegave him good wishes and encouragement . He turned at the grated door to thank them . The jailer closed the door , and he never saw the ghostlike people again . 
 The gate opened onto a stone staircase , leading upward . When they had climbed forty steps (Darnay , who had only been a prisoner for half an hour , already counted them) , the jailer opened a low , black door , and they entered a lonely cell . It was cold and damp but was not dark . 
 This is your cell , said the jailer . 
 Why am I locked up alone ? 
 How do I know ! 
 Can I buy a pen , ink , and paper from you ? 
 Those were not my orders . You will be visited and can ask for them then , but for now you can only buy your food . 
 In the cell there was a chair , a table , and a straw mattress . The jailer inspected these objects and the four walls before going out . Darnay had the thought as he leaned against the opposite wall that this jailer was so swollen , both in his face and his body , that he looked like a man who had drowned and filled with water . When the jailer was gone , he thought , Now I've been left for dead . He stopped then and looked down at the mattress . He turned away from it feeling sick and thought , And here these crawling creatures are the first thing to happen to a body after death . 
 Five paces wide by four and a half paces long , Darnay thought over and over . He walked back and forth in his cell , measuring it . He could hear the sounds of Paris below him like muffled drums and voices . Dr . Manette made shoes , he thought over and over again . Darnay measured it again and walked faster to distract himself from the later thought . The ghostlike figures that disappeared when the gate was closed . There was one woman in black among them , leaning in the window . There was light shining on her golden hair , and she looked like Let's ride on again , for God's sake , through the lit-up villages when all the people are awake ! He made shoes , he made shoes , he made shoes . Five paces by four and a half . These bits of thought ran through his mind as Darnay walked faster and faster , stubbornly counting again and again . The sounds of Paris changed . They still sounded like muffled drums , but with the wail of voices he knew mixed in the swell of sound that rose above them . 
 The branch of Tellson's Bank in the Saint Germaine Quarter of Paris was in one wing of a large house . It was accessible by a courtyard and closed off from the street by a high wall and strong gate . The house had belonged to a wealthy nobleman , who had lived in it until he fled Paris in his cook's clothes and snuck across the border . This man , who fled like an animal being chased by hunters , was the same monseigneur who had needed three strong servants plus his cook to serve him his chocolate . 
 Now the monseigneur was gone . The three former servants had made up for having worked for him by being more than ready and willing to cut his throat in the name of the Republic . The people had first taken control of the monseigneur's house , then took it away from him entirely . Things were changing so fast and decrees were announced so quickly that now , on September third , representatives of the new government had possession of monseigneur's house . They had marked it with the flag of the Republic and were drinking brandy inside . 
 If Tellson's Bank in London had been like Tellson's Bank in Paris , it would have driven the head of the bank crazy . What would the serious , respectable , responsible British men at Tellson's have thought of the orange trees in boxes in the bank's courtyard , or the sculpture of Cupid that hung over the counter ? But such things were in the Paris bank . Tellson's had painted the Cupid white , but you could still see him on the ceiling . The figure was wearing linen and aiming his arrows at money , as love often does . In London , this Cupid , the mirror on the wall , and the young clerks who danced in public every chance they got would surely lead to the bank's failure . Yet , Tellson's Bank in France prospered under these conditions . As long as things didn't get too out of hand in France , no one was concerned enough to withdraw his money . 
 That night , no man could say how much money would be drawn out of Tellson's Bank in Paris , or how much would stay there , lost and forgotten . No man could say what plates and jewels would stay hidden in the bank's vaults while the owners of those items grew old in prison , or when those owners would die violently . No man could say how many accounts with Tellson's would never be settled in this world , but carried into the next by their deceased owners . No man could answer these questions any more than Mr . Jarvis Lorry could , though he thought seriously about these things . He sat by a newly lit wood fire (it had turned cold early this year) , and on his honest and brave face was a dark look of horror . 
 He was so dedicated to Tellson's that he stayed in rooms in the bank . It made members of the bank feel secure to know that patriots occupied the main building , but the honest Mr . Lorry didn't think about that . He didn't care about these circumstances , only that he did his job . On the other side of the courtyard , under a row of columns , there was a good deal of room for carriages . Some of the monseigneur's carriages were still kept there . Against two of the pillars were fastened two large flaring torches , and in their light , standing out in the open , was a large grindstone a stone used for sharpening grindstone . It had been mounted there quickly and looked like it had been brought from some nearby blacksmith or other workshop . Mr . Lorry got up and looked out the window at these harmless objects . He shivered and went back to his seat by the fireplace . He had opened the window as well as the lattice blinds outside , and then closed them again . A chill passed through his body . 
 The usual sounds of the city at night could be heard from the streets past the high wall and the strong gate . Now and then an indescribable ring sounded among the noise of the city . It sounded weird and otherworldly , as if some unusual , terrible sounds were traveling up to Heaven . 
 Thank God that no one that I care deeply about is in this awful city tonight , said Mr . Lorry , clasping his hands . May God have mercy on all those who are in danger ! 
 Soon afterward , the bell at the gate rang , and he thought , They've come back ! He sat there , listening , but there was no loud noise of someone coming into the courtyard as he had expected . The gate clanged again , and then everything was quiet . 
 He felt nervous and fearful , and it made him worry about the security of the bank . It was well guarded , and he got up to move closer to the trusty people who were watching over it . Suddenly the door opened and two people rushed in . He fell back in shock when he saw them . 
 It was Lucie and her father ! Lucie had her arms stretched out toward him . She had that same old look of intense concentration and concern on her face . It seemed like it had been stamped there for this one particular moment in her life . 
 What is this ? yelled Mr . Lorry , breathless and confused . What's the matter ? Lucie ! Dr . Manette ! What's happened ? Why are you here ? What is it ? 
 She looked at him , pale and upset . She said , panting , Oh my dear friend ! It's my husband ! 
 Your husband , Lucie ? 
 Charles . 
 What about Charles ? 
 He is here . 
 Here in Paris ? 
 He's been here for three or four days , I don't know how many exactly . I can't think straight . A errand of kindness brought him here . We didn't know he was coming . He was stopped at the barrier and sent to prison . 
 Mr . Lorry cried out . Almost at the same moment , the bell at the front gate rang again and a loud noise of footsteps and voices could be heard entering the courtyard . 
 What is that noise ? asked Dr . Manette , going to the window . 
 Don't look ! yelled Mr . Lorry . Don't look out ! Dr . Manette , don't touch the blind ! 
 The doctor turned toward him , with his hand on the window lock , and he said with a calm smile : 
 My dear friend , I have a charmed life in this city . I have been a prisoner in the Bastille . There is no patriot in Paris or all of France who would touch me knowing I had been a prisoner there , unless it was to embrace me and carry me in triumph . My suffering has given me a power that got us safely through the barrier . It helped us obtain news of where Charles was and helped get us here . I knew that would be the case . I knew I could help Charles to safety . I told Lucie so . What is that noise ? His hand was on the window again . 
 Don't look ! yelled Mr . Lorry , desperately . No , Lucie , my dear , you can't look either ! He put his arm around her and held her . Don't be so afraid . I swear I haven't heard anything about Charles being harmed . I didn't even suspect that he was here in Paris . Which prison is he in ? 
 La Force ! 
 La Force ! Lucie , my child , if ever you were brave and helpful in your lifeand I know that you have always been bothyou will pull yourself together and do exactly what I tell you . More depends on it than you can think , or I can say . There is nothing you can do for him tonight , and you cannot go outside . I'm telling you this because what I have to ask you to do for Charles is the hardest thing to do at all . You have to listen and be calm and quiet . You must go into a room in the back here . You must leave your father and I alone for two minutes , and you must do it right now . It's a matter of life and death . 
 I will do what you tell me . I see in your face that you know I can't do anything else . I trust you . 
 Mr . Lorry kissed her and brought her quickly into his room . He turned the key , and then he hurried back to the doctor . He opened the window and partly opened the blinds and put his hand on the doctor's arm . They both looked out into the courtyard . 
 They saw a crowd of men and women . There weren't enough of them to fill the courtyard . There weren't more than forty or fifty of them in all . The people who had possession of the house had let them in at the front gate , and they had rushed in to work at the grindstone . It had apparently been placed there for this purpose , as it was a convenient spot that was hidden away . 
 What awful people doing such awful work ! 
 The grindstone had a double handle , and two men turned it madly . Their long hair flipped back when the whirling of the grindstone brought their faces up . Their faces were more horrible and cruel than the wildest savages in their most terrifying costumes . They wore false eyebrows and fake moustaches , and their ugly faces were covered with blood and sweat , and were contorted with howling . They were staring and glaring with excitement and lack of sleep . As they turned and turned the grindstone , their wet hair flung forward over their eyes , then backward over their necks . Some women brought wine to their mouths so they could drink , and with the blood and wine and the sparks coming off of the stone , the atmosphere seemed filled with gore and fire . Every person in the group had blood on him . Shoving past each other to be next at the grinding stone were shirtless men who had blood all over their arms and bodies , men in bloody rags , and men wearing stolen bits of women's lace and silk and ribbon , all stained with blood . Hatchets , knives , bayonets , and swords were all brought to be sharpened and were covered in blood . Some of the swords were tied to people's wrists with strips of linen and pieces of dresses . They used different things to tie them , but they were all red with blood . As the people carrying these weapons pulled them out of the grindstone's sparks and ran off into the streets , the same red color could be seen in their eyes . Any civilized watcher would have given twenty years of his life to kill the owners of those eyes . 
 All of this was seen in an instant , as if it were the vision of a drowning man , or the vision of any person seeing the world at a great turning point . They moved away from the window and the doctor looked at Mr . Lorry's pale face , hoping he would explain what they had seen . 
 They're murdering the prisoners , Mr . Lorry whispered , glancing fearfully around the locked room . If you're sure what you say is true , if you really have the power you think you haveas I believe you dogo show yourself to these violent people and have them take you to La Force Prison . It may be too lateI don't knowbut go right this minute ! 
 Dr . Manette shook Mr . Lorry's hand and rushed out of the room without putting his hat on . He was in the courtyard when Mr . Lorry pulled the blinds back again and looked out the window . 
 His long white hair , his remarkable face , and his confidence allowed him to move right to the center of the group near the grindstone . He pushed their weapons aside as he walked through them , and for a few moments there was a pause . Then they started rushing around and talking . The doctor spoke , but Mr . Lorry couldn't hear what he was saying . Mr . Lorry saw him surrounded by all of them , in the middle of a line of twenty men . They were all linked shoulder to shoulder or hand to shoulder and were yelling , Long live the Bastille prisoner ! Help the Bastille prisoner's family in La Force ! Make room for the Bastille prisoner in front there ! Save the prisoner Evremonde at La Force ! and thousands of other responses . 
 Mr . Lorry closed the lattice blind again . His heart was beating fast . He closed the window and the curtain and rushed to Lucie , and he told her that her father was being helped by the people and had gone to look for her husband . He found her daughter and Miss Pross there with her . It never occurred to him that seeing them there should have surprised him until much later , when he sat watching them in the relative quiet of the night . 
 By that time , Lucie had fallen asleep on the floor at his feet , still holding his hand . Miss Pross had laid the child down on Mr . Lorry's bed , where her head had gradually fallen onto the pillow next to Lucie . Oh , the long , long night , with Lucie crying out for her husband ! Oh , the long night , with her father still gone and no word of how he was doing . 
 The bell at the front gate rang twice more during the night . Again a crowd of people rushed in and used the grindstone . What is it ? cried Lucie , frightened . Quiet ! They sharpen the solders' swords there , said Mr . Lorry . This house is national property now and is used as a kind of armory a building in which weapons are stored armory . 
 It happened twice more , but the last time they came the crowd was smaller . Soon afterward , the sun began to come up . Mr . Lorry released himself softly from Lucie's grasp and cautiously looked out the window again . A man was getting up from the pavement beside the grindstone . He was so covered with blood that he looked like a badly wounded soldier , regaining consciousness on a battlefield covered with dead bodies . He looked around him with an empty stare . Soon the exhausted killer noticed one of the monseigneur's carriages in the weak daylight . He staggered over to the gorgeous vehicle , climbed into it , shut the door , and went to sleep on its dainty cushions . 
 It was later in the day when Mr . Lorry looked out the window again . The sun was shining red on the courtyard , and the grindstone was still standing there alone in the morning air , covered in blood that would never come off . 
 The next day , when business hours came around , one of the first things that occurred to the business-minded Mr . Lorry was that he had no right to endanger Tellson's Bank by protecting the wife of an emigrant prisoner inside the bank . He would have risked his own belongings , safety , or life for Lucie without a second thought . But he was putting the bank at risk , not just himself , and as far as the bank was concerned , he was a strict businessman . 
 First , he thought about Defarge . He considered finding the wine shop again and getting Defarge's advice on the safest place to live in the chaotic city . But the same reason that made him want to ask Defarge also made him reject the idea . Defarge lived in the most violent quarter and was certainly deeply involved in what was happening there . 
 It was almost noon . Since the doctor hadn't returned yet , and since every minute he was missing was a threat to Tellson's Bank , Mr . Lorry worked out a plan with Lucie . She said that her father had talked about renting a place to live for a short period of time in that quarter near the bank . As renting a place didn't threaten Tellson's at alland as they would certainly have to stay some time , since even if Charles were released he wouldn't be allowed to leaveMr . Lorry went out to look for such a place . He found an acceptable one high up in a removed side street , where the closed blinds in all the other windows marked the homes as deserted . 
 He immediately brought Lucie , her child , and Miss Pross to this apartment . He gave them as much comfort as he could , and more comfort than he allowed himself . He left Jerry with them to guard the doorway and went back to his own business . He continued to worry about them as the day dragged on . 
 The day passed slowly , and tired him out , until the bank finally closed . Once again he was alone in his room from the night before . He was thinking about what to do next when he heard footsteps on the stairs . In a few moments , a man stood in front of him . The man looked at Mr . Lorry closely and called him by name : 
 I am your servant , said Mr . Lorry . Do you know me ? 
 The man was strong and had dark , curly hair . He was between forty-five and fifty years old . He answered by repeating the words exactly the same way : 
 Do you know me ? 
 I have seen you somewhere . 
 Maybe at my wine shop ? 
 Very interested and excited , Mr . Lorry said , You were sent by Dr . Manette ? 
 Yes . I was sent by Dr . Manette . 
 And what does he say ? What information did he send me ? 
 Defarge handed him a scrap of paper . It was written in the doctor's handwriting : 
 Charles is safe , but I cannot leave here safely yet . I have convinced them to let Charles write a short note to Lucie . Let Defarge see Lucie . 
 It was dated from La Force Prison within the past hour . 
 Will you go with me to see his wife ? said Mr . Lorry , happy and relieved after reading the note out loud . 
 Yes , answered Defarge . 
 Mr . Lorry had not yet noticed how strangely reserved and mechanical Defarge was when he spoke . Mr . Lorry put on his hat and they went out into the courtyard . There , they found two women , one of them knitting . 
 You are Madame Defarge , of course ! said Mr . Lorry . She had looked exactly the same as she had seventeen years ago . 
 It is she , said Monsieur Defarge . 
 Is Madame Defarge going with us ? asked Mr . Lorry , noticing that she was moving along with them . 
 Yes . She is going so she can see their faces and recognize them . It is for their safety . 
 Mr . Lorry was starting to notice the odd way Defarge was behaving . Mr . Lorry looked doubtfully at him and led the way , and both of the women followed them . The second woman was The Vengeance . 
 They walked through the streets as quickly as they could and climbed the staircase to the new house . Jerry let them in and they found Lucie crying alone . She was overjoyed by the news Mr . Lorry gave her about Charles , and she grasped Defarge's hand , the one in which he was carrying the note . She didn't realize that Defarge might have been killing prisoners with those same hands that night , and might have killed Charles if they hadn't been so lucky . 
 The note said , My dearest . Be brave . I am doing well , and your father is able to influence the people here . You cannot answer this letter . Kiss Little Lucie for me . 
 That was all he had written , but it meant so much to Lucie that she turned from Defarge to Madame Defarge and kissed one of her hands . It was a passionate , loving , thankful , womanly thing to do . But Madame Defarge didn't respond at all . She just dropped her hand coldly and went back to knitting . 
 There was something about Madame Defarge's touch that made Lucie freeze . She stopped as she was putting the note in her bosom , and with her hands near her neck , she gave Madame Defarge a terrified look . Madame Defarge looked back at her with a cold , emotionless stare . 
 My dear , said Mr . Lorry , jumping in to explain . There are often uprisings in the streets . And , although it is unlikely that they will bother you , Madame Defarge wants to come with us so she can see those she might be able to protect , what they look like , to identify them . I believe I'm correct , yes , Citizen Defarge ? said Mr . Lorry . He said these reassuring words rather tentatively , as he saw the serious manner of Defarge and the women . 
 Defarge looked gloomily at his wife . His only answer was a grunt of agreement . 
 Lucie , you'd better leave your daughter and Miss Pross here , said Mr . Lorry , doing all he could to appease them . Miss Pross is an English lady and doesn't know any French , he told Defarge . 
 Miss Pross , who strongly believed she could handle any foreigner , wasn't shaken or upset by being in a dangerous situation . She came in with her arms crossed and said in English to The Vengeance , whom she saw first , Well , I am sure , Boldface ! I hope you are doing well ! She also coughed at Madame Defarge in a British manner . Neither one of them paid much attention to her , though . 
 Is that Darnay's child ? asked Madame Defarge . She stopped knitting for the first time and pointed her knitting needle at Little Lucie as if it were the finger of Fate . 
 Yes , madame , answered Mr . Lorry . This is our poor prisoner's darling daughter and his only child . 
 The shadow of Madame Defarge and the other two fell on little Lucie in such a dark and threatening manner that her mother instinctively knelt down on the ground next to her and held her to her chest . The shadow seemed to fall on both the mother and her child . 
 That's enough , husband , said Madame Defarge . I have seen them . We can go . 
 But her behavior was menacing enoughnot in an obvious way , but hiddento frighten Lucie . She took Madame Defarge's dress in her hand and said : 
 You will be good to my poor husband . You won't hurt him . You will help me see him if you can ? 
 Your husband is not my business here , answered Madame Defarge , looking down at her calmly . It is you , Dr . Manette's daughter , that is my concern . 
 For my sake , then , be merciful to my husband . For the sake of my daughter ! She will pray that you are merciful to Charles . We are more afraid of you than we are of these others . 
 Madame Defarge took it as a compliment and looked at her husband . Defarge , who had been biting his thumbnail nervously and looking at her , set his face in a stern expression . 
 What did your husband say in that little letter ? asked Madame Defarge , smiling . Influence . Something about influence ? 
 That my father has a lot of influence on the people around him , said Lucie . She took the paper quickly from her breast without looking away from Madame Defarge . 
 Surely his influence will get Charles released ! said Madame Defarge . Let it ! 
 As a wife and a mother , cried Lucie sincerely , I beg you to take pity on me . Don't use any of your power against my innocent husband , but use it to help him . Oh , my sister and fellow woman , think of me . I am a wife and a mother ! 
 Madame Defarge looked as coldly as ever at the pleading woman , and turning to her friend The Vengeance , said : 
 The wives and mothers we used to see , since we were as young as your daughter and much younger , have not been thought of . We have seen their husbands and fathers sent to prison and kept away from them enough times . All our lives we have seen our fellow women and their children suffer . They have suffered from poverty , nakedness , hunger , thirst , sickness , misery , oppression , and neglect of all kinds . 
 We've seen nothing else , answered The Vengeance . 
 We have endured this for a long time , said Madame Defarge , looking at Lucie again . Judge you ! Is it likely that the suffering of one wife and mother would matter much to us now ? 
 Madame Defarge went back to her knitting and left . The Vengeance followed . Monsieur Defarge went out last and closed the door . 
 Be brave , my dear Lucie , said Mr . Lorry , picking her up off the ground . Be brave ! So far , all is going well . It's going much , much better than it has for many less fortunate people . Cheer up , and be thankful . 
 I am not ungrateful , I hope , but that terrible woman has thrown a dark shadow on my hopes . 
 Tut , tut ! said Mr . Lorry . Why are you so sad ? A shadow ? Really ? But there is no substance to a shadow , Lucie . 
 But the way the Defarges were acting had thrown a shadow on him too , and what they had said secretly bothered him very much . 
 Dr . Manette didn't come back until one morning four days later . Lucie was kept from knowing so much of what had happened during that terrible period that it wasn't until much later , when she had been away from France for a long time , that she learned eleven hundred defenseless prisonersboth male and female and of all ageshad been killed by the people . This horrible deed had gone on for four days and nights , while the dead bodies had poisoned the air around her . She only knew that there had been an attack on the prisons and that all of the political prisoners had been in danger . She knew that some of them had been dragged out of the prisons by the crowd and killed . 
 Swearing Mr . Lorry to secrecy , Dr . Manette informed him that the crowd had taken him through the bloodshed in the streets to La Force Prison . There he had found a self-appointed tribunal a court of justice tribunal holding trials in the prison . The prisoners were brought in front of the tribunal one-by-one , and the tribunal would quickly decide if they should be killed , released , or , in a few cases , brought back to their cells . The people accompanying him had presented Dr . Manette to the tribunal . He had told them his name and his profession and that he had spent eighteen years as a secret prisoner at the Bastille who had never been officially accused of anything . One of the tribunal members stood up and identified him . This man was Defarge . 
 Dr . Manette told Mr . Lorry that he had learned from the lists on the table that Charles was one of the prisoners who was still alive . Dr . Manette had begged the tribunal to let Charles live . Some of the men on the tribunal were asleep , some were awake , some were covered in blood and some were clean , some were sober and some were drunk . He told them that the people had granted him the right , as a sufferer under the now-defeated justice system , to have Charles Darnay brought in front of the tribunal and examined . It seemed that Charles was about to be released when his luck came to a stop . The doctor couldn't understand why . The members of the tribunal then spoke a few words to each other in secret . The man acting as president of the tribunal then told Dr . Manette that the prisoner had to stay in custody , but for the doctor's sake he would be kept safe . Then , on a signal , Charles was taken inside the prison again . The doctor had begged for permission to stay and make sure that Charles wasn't , through malice or bad luck , taken out to the violent crowd outside the gate . Their murderous yells often drowned out the court proceedings . Dr . Manette had been allowed to stay and had stayed there in the courtroom until the danger was over . 
 The things he saw there between his brief meals and sleep will remain untold . The intense celebration when a prisoner was saved didn't surprise him any less than the intense rage toward those who were sentenced to death and cut to pieces . Dr . Manette said one prisoner there had been set free into the street , only to be mistakenly stabbed with a pike as he went out . The crowd begged the doctor to go tend to his wound , and he had gone out to him from the same gate . He found the man in the arms of a group of volunteers . They were sitting on top of the bodies of people they had killed . They helped the doctor and took care of the wounded man with gentle concern . Their helpful behavior was so inconsistent that it was as disturbing as anything else in that awful nightmare . They made a stretcher for him and carried him carefully away , and then they picked up their weapons again and went back to killing people so terribly that the doctor covered his eyes with his hands and passed out in the middle of it . 
 As Mr . Lorry listened , and as he watched the face of his friend who was now sixty-two years old , he started to worry that these terrible experiences might cause a relapse of his old dangerous condition . 
 But he had never seen Dr . Manette as he currently was . He had never known him the way he was now . For the first time , Dr . Manette felt that his suffering in the Bastille had given him strength and power . For the first time , he felt that in prison he had slowly gained the strength and skills that would free his daughter's husband and bring him to safety . It will all pay off in the end , my friend , said Dr . Manette . It wasn't a terrible waste . As my daughter , Lucie , helped me recover , I will help bring her husband back to her . With the help of Heaven , I will do it ! Jarvis Lorry saw the fire in his eyes and the determined look on his face . He had the calm , strong appearance of a man whose life seemed to have been put on hold for so many years , then started up again with an energy that had been hidden until it was now useful . Mr . Lorry believed him . 
 The doctor felt determined to such a degree that he could have conquered greater obstacles than the ones he now faced . He kept working as a doctor , whose business was with all types of peopleprisoners and free people , rich and poor , bad and good . He used his influence so well that he was soon the official doctor for three prisons , including La Force . He could now tell Lucie that her husband was no longer imprisoned alone , but was mixed in with the main prison population . He saw her husband once a week , and he brought messages to her that Charles spoke to him directly . Sometimes Charles himself wrote a letter to her , though the doctor was never the one who delivered it . Lucie wasn't allowed to write to him , though , because many suspected that there were plots being developed in the prisons , especially involving emigrants who had made friends or met important people abroad . 
 The new life of Dr . Manette was very stressful . Still , the wise Mr . Lorry saw that he took pride in it . Nothing unappealing tainted this pride . It was natural for him to be proud , and he deserved it . But Mr . Lorry thought it was strange . Dr , Manette knew that until then , his daughter and Mr . Lorry had associated his imprisonment with his personal suffering and weakness . Now this had changed . He knew that his suffering in the Bastille had given him the power to save Charles and get him back to safety . He was in high spirits about the change . He was a leader now , and his daughter and Mr . Lorry were the weak ones trusting in his strength . The relationship between Lucie and him had been reversed . But only the way the most intense gratitude and affection could reverse them . He couldn't have taken any pride in anything but helping her in some way after she had helped him so much . It's strange to see , thought Mr . Lorry in his friendly and smart way , but it is right . So , take the lead , my dear friend , and stay in charge . We couldn't be in better hands . 
 The doctor never stopped trying to get Charles set free or at least brought to trial , but the public opinion of the time was too strong for him to fight against . The new era had begun . The king was tried , convicted , and had his head cut off . The Republic of Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death was ready to be victorious and kill anyone who was against them . A black flag flew day and night from the tall towers of Notre Dame . Three hundred thousand men rose up against their oppressors . They rose up all over France , as if they were growing out of the earth . They came from hills and plains , rock , gravel , and mud . They came from the South and the North , from fields and forests , from vineyards and olive fields . They came from the trimmed grass , cornfields , the lush farmland near the rivers , and the sandy beaches . What single person could compete with the storm rising during the first year after of the Revolution ? This storm was coming up from the ground instead of falling from the sky . Instead of a storm falling from Heaven , Heaven wanted nothing to do with this storm . 
 The violence didn't stop , let up , or quiet down . People lost track of time . Days and nights blended together . It was like the beginning of time when there were only the morning and night of the first day and no other time existed . The furious people of France lost track of time the way a fever patient does . Now , breaking the city's unnatural silence , the executioner cut off the head of the king and showed it to the people . Almost immediately after he showed them the head of his wife , the queen . She had spent eight months suffering in prison after her husband died , turning her hair gray . 
 But because such times bring contradictions with them , the time felt long , though it moved so quickly . There was a revolutionary tribunal set up in the capital . There were also forty or fifty thousand revolutionary committees all over the country . These committees enacted a Law of the Suspected , which removed any assurance of freedom or safety and allowed any good , innocent person to be accused by any bad , guilty one . The prisons filled up with innocent people who couldn't get their cases heard . These things became the established order and seemed to have been around since ancient times before they were even a few weeks old . Above all , the guillotine grew so familiar to everyone that it seemed like it had been around since the beginning of the world . 
 It was popular in jokes . People joked that it was the best cure for a headache , that it always kept the hair from turning gray , that it refined the complexion . It was the National Razor that gave you a close shave . People joked that you kissed the guillotine , looked through the little window , and sneezed into the sack . It was a sign of the rebirth of the human race and took the place of the Christian cross . Models of the guillotine were worn on necklaces that used to have crosses on them . People now bowed down and worshipped the guillotine and rejected the cross . 
 It cut off so many heads that it was stained red along with the ground underneath it . It was taken apart and put together again when it was needed , like a puzzle for a terrible young child . It silenced those who spoke well , knocked down those who were powerful , and eliminated those who were beautiful and good . It had cut off the heads of twenty-two respectable peopletwenty-one of them were alive and one was already deadwithin twenty-two minutes on one morning . The executioner who operated it had been nicknamed Samson after the strong man of the Old Testament . But with the guillotine , he was stronger than Samson , and more blind , and he tore down the gates of God's own temple every day . 
 Dr . Manette moved through these dangers and among the dangerous people with a clear head . He was confident and remained cautiously persistent . He never doubted that he would eventually save Charles Darnay . Yet , time passed so quickly that Charles had now been in prison for a year and three months . That December , the Revolution had grown so much more violent and out of control that the rivers in the south of France were filled with bodies of people who had been drowned at night , and prisoners were shot in groups in broad daylight . Still , Dr . Manette viewed all these terrors with a clear head . There was no one as well known in Paris at the time and no one in a stranger situation . He was quiet , kind , and essential in the hospitals and prisons , and he treated killers and victims the same . He was neutral , and when he was treating patients , the fact that he had once been a prisoner in the Bastille set him apart from everyone else . He was not suspected or questioned any more than he would have been if he really had been brought back to life eighteen years earlier and was a ghost wandering among the living . 
 Charles had been in prison for one year and three months . During that time , Lucie never knew from one hour to the next if the guillotine would cut off his head the next day . Every day , carts filled with condemned prisoners rumbled through the streets . Beautiful girls ; attractive women with brown , black , or gray hair ; young men and women ; sturdy old men ; nobles and peasants all went to bleed at the guillotine . Every day they were brought from the dark cellars of the prisons to the light of the outdoors and brought through the streets to satisfy the guillotine's thirst . Of the Revolution's slogan , Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death , the last one , death , was the easiest to impart . O guillotine ! 
 If the suddenness of Lucie's misfortune , and the chaos of the time , had stunned her into waiting for Charles's release in idle despair , she would have been like many others in her situation . But since she had first found her father in the attic in Saint Antoine , she had always been committed to her responsibilities . She was even more committed now , as all who are quietly loyal and good always are . 
 As soon as they settled into their new house and Dr . Manette had fallen into his routine of treating patients , she arranged the little household just as if her husband had been there . Everything had its place and time , and she taught Little Lucie as regularly as if they had all been together in their home in London . To trick herself into believing she and Charles would soon be reunited , she used little devices , such as the preparations made for his quick return , and the fact that his chair and books were set aside waiting for him . These devices , and the prayer she said at night for all the poor people who were in prison and in danger , especially Charles , were the only things that relieved her worried mind . 
 Her appearance did not change much . The plain , dark dresses that she and little Lucie wore looked like mourning dresses , but they were as neat and well treated as the brighter clothes they wore during happier times . She was paler now , and the old , intense expression on her forehead was constantly on her face , not an occasional thing anymore . Otherwise , she still looked very attractive . Sometimes , at night when she kissed her father , she would burst into tears after having hidden her feelings all day . She would tell him that he was the only thing on earth she could depend on . He always answered determinedly , Nothing can happen to Charles without my knowing about it , and I know that I can save him , Lucie . 
 They had only been living this new life of theirs for a few weeks when , upon coming home one night , her father said to her : 
 My dear , there is a window high up in the prison that Charles can sometimes look out of at three in the afternoon . When he can get to itwhich depends on many uncertain thingshe thinks he might be able to see you in the street if you stood in a specific place . I'll show you where it is . But you will not be able to see him . And even if you could , it wouldn't be safe for you to make any signs or gestures to each other . 
 Oh , show me the place , Father , and I will go there every day . 
 From that point on she waited there for two hours every day , no matter what the weather was . When the clock struck two she would be there , and at four o'clock she would walk away resignedly . When the weather allowed she would bring Lucie with her , and at other times she would go alone . But she never missed a single day . 
 The place where she would stand was a dark and dirty corner of a small , winding street . The small hut of a wood sawyer a person who saws wood for a living wood sawyer , who sawed logs into pieces for firewood , was the only house at that end of the street . The rest of the street was enclosed by walls . On the third day Lucie was there , the wood sawyer noticed her . 
 Good day , citizeness . 
 Good day , citizen . 
 This way of addressing people was now required by law . It had started as something the more passionate patriots did by choice some time ago , but now everyone was required to do it . 
 I see you're walking here again , citizeness ? 
 You see that I am , citizen ! 
 The wood sawyer was a little man who gestured too much . He had once been a repairer of roads . He looked at the prison and pointed to it . He put his ten fingers in front of his face to represent prison bars and peeked through them playfully . 
 But it's none of my business , he said , going back to sawing wood . 
 The next day he was waiting for her and approached her as soon as she appeared . 
 What ? You're walking here again , citizeness ? 
 Yes , citizen . 
 Ah ! And you brought a child too ! This is your mother , isn't it , my little citizeness ? 
 Should I say yes , Mamma ? little Lucie whispered to her mother , pulling close to her . 
 Yes , dearest , said Lucie . 
 Yes , citizen , little Lucie said to the wood sawyer . 
 Ah ! But it's none of my business . My work is my business . Look at my saw ! I call it my little guillotine . La la la , la la la ! And off goes his head ! 
 Part of the piece of the wood fell off as he spoke , and he threw it into a basket . 
 I call myself the Samson of the firewood guillotine . Look again ! He sang as he cut another piece of wood . Loo loo loo , loo loo loo ! And off goes her head ! Now I'll do a child . Tickle , tickle , pickle , pickle ! And off goes the child's head . A whole family ! 
 Lucie shuddered as he threw two more pieces of wood into his basket , but it was impossible to be there while the wood sawyer was working nearby without him seeing her . Therefore , to keep him happy , she always spoke to him first . Often she would give him money for drinks , which he took happily . 
 He was a curious man . Sometimes when she had completely forgotten about him and was looking at the prison roof and grates thinking of her husband , she would realize that the wood sawyer was looking at her . His knee would be on his bench and his saw would have stopped moving . But it's none of my business ! he would usually say when this happened , and then he would quickly go back to work again . 
 No matter what the weather was , Lucie spent two hours of every day at this place . In the snow and frost during winter , the strong winds during spring , the hot sunshine of summer , or the rains of autumn , Lucie would be there . Then she would be back again in the snow and frost of winter . Every day when she left she would kiss the prison wall . Her father told her that her husband only saw her once every five or six times she went . Sometimes it was two or three times in a row . Sometimes it wasn't for a week or two . It was enough that he saw her when he got the chance . If there were even a chance of him seeing her , she would have spent the whole day there seven days a week . 
 She continued to do this until December . Meanwhile , her father moved among all the terrible events happening with a cool head . One afternoon , when it was snowing lightly , Lucie arrived at her usual corner . It was a day when people were celebrating and there was a festival . As she walked through the streets she noticed that the houses were decorated with little pikes that had little red caps stuck on them . They were also decorated with three-colored ribbons , and had the standard slogan of the Republic (many in three-colored letters) , One and Indivisible . Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death ! 
 The wood sawyer's gloomy little shop was so small that this slogan hardly fit on it . He had gotten somebody to write it for him who had barely been able to squeeze in the word death . On his rooftop he had placed a cap on a pike , as all good citizens were expected to do , and he had placed his saw in one window with the words Little Saint Guillotine written on it , for now people referred to the guillotine as Saint Guillotine . His shop was closed and he wasn't there , and Lucie was relieved to be left alone . 
 But the wood sawyer wasn't far away . Soon Lucie heard people hurrying toward her and shouting , and she was frightened . A moment later a crowd of people came rushing around the corner by the prison wall . The wood sawyer was in the middle of them , hand-in-hand with the woman known as The Vengeance . There were at least five hundred people there , and they were dancing like five thousand devils . Their own singing was their only music . They danced to the popular song of the Revolution , and the way they kept in time sounded like they were all gnashing their teeth in unison . Men and women danced together . Women danced with women , men danced with men , and people danced with whomever they ended up close to . At first the crowd was made up of red caps and rough wool rags , but as they filled the street and started dancing around Lucie , a terrible , ghostlike figure started dancing above them . They moved forward , then back , and they slapped each other's hands and grabbed each other's heads . They spun around by themselves or caught each other and spun around in pairs . They did this until many of them dropped to the ground . While those people were on the ground , the rest of them joined hands and all spun around together , and then the ring broke and they formed separate rings of two and four people . They spun and spun until they all stopped at the same time . Then they started up again , hit each other , grabbed at each other , tore at each other , and then started spinning in the opposite direction . Suddenly they stopped again . They paused and started anew , forming into lines that were as wide as the street . Then they ran off screaming with their heads bowed low and their hands high in the air . No fight could have been half as terrifying as this dance was . It was so much like an evil sportsomething that had once been innocent that was now evila healthy pastime that had been changed into something used to excite people and incite them to violence . The parts of it that looked graceful made it even more ugly as it showed how all good things had turned perverse and terrible . The young maiden's bosom , or the pretty young girl's head , or the delicate foot involved in this terrible dance were the types of things that marked this disjointed time . 
 The dance was called the Carmagnole . As it passed , leaving Lucie frightened and confused in the doorway of the wood-sawyer's house , the snow fell quietly . It lied white and soft on the ground as if the dance had never happened . 
 Lucie had covered her eyes with her hand for a moment , and when she looked up Dr . Manette stood before her . Oh , Father ! This was a cruel , terrible sight to see . 
 I know , my dear . I know . I have seen it many times . Don't be frightened ! None of them would ever hurt you . 
 I'm not frightened for myself , Father , but when I think of Charles , and these merciless people
 We will get him safely away from these people soon . When I left he was climbing to the window . I came to tell you . You weren't here for him to see . Blow a kiss toward that roof at the top . 
 I'll do it , Father , and I send him my soul with it . 
 You can't see him , my poor dear ? 
 No , Father , said Lucie . She was crying longingly as she kissed her hand . No . 
 They heard footsteps in the snow . It was Madame Defarge . Dr . Manette greeted her . I salute you , citizeness , he said . She answered , I salute you , citizen . She said it as she passed , and she said nothing more . Then she was gone , like a shadow over the snow-covered street . 
 Give me your arm , my love . Leave here looking cheerful and brave for your husband's sake . That is the best thing you can do . They left the spot . All of this won't be for nothing . Charles is going before the court tomorrow . 
 Tomorrow ! 
 There is no time to lose . I am well prepared , but we need to take precautions . These steps could not be taken until he was actually summoned before the tribunal . He hasn't received the notice yet , but I know that he will soon be summoned for tomorrow and taken to the Conciergerie a former palace and prison in Paris where prisoners were tried Conciergerie . I have recent information . You're not afraid , are you ? 
 She almost couldn't answer . I trust you . 
 You must trust me completely . Your waiting is almost over , my darling . He will be returned to you within a few hours . I have done everything I can to protect him , and now I must see Mr . Lorry . 
 He stopped . There was the sound of heavy wheels nearby . They both knew too well what the sound meant . They counted : one , two , three . Three carts bringing prisoners to the guillotine , moving over the snow . 
 I must see Mr . Lorry , repeated the doctor , turning the other way . 
 Mr . Lorry was still at the bank . He had never left it . He and his records were in frequent demand regarding property that had been taken away from its owners and given to the state . He saved what he could for the owners . There was no better man alive to be trusted to take care of Tellson's property , and to keep quiet . 
 The sky turned a murky red and yellow , and a mist rose up from the Seine River . Night was coming , and it was almost dark when they arrived at Tellson's Bank . The elegant former home of the monseigneur was wrecked and empty . Above a pile of dust and ashes in the courtyard was a sign that said National Property . Republic One and Indivisible . Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death ! 
 Someone was with Mr . Lorry who Dr . Manette couldn't see . Who was it ? His riding coat was on the chair . Who had he been talking to when Mr . Lorry came out , nervous and surprised , to embrace Dr . Manette ? To whom did he repeat Lucie's words when he raised his voice , turned toward the door of the room he had just come from , and said , He's been taken to the Conciergerie and goes on trial tomorrow . 
 The dreaded tribunal was made up of five judges , a public prosecutor , and a selected jury . The court was in session every day , and their lists were sent out every night . The jailers in the various prisons read the lists out loud to their prisoners . They would often make a joke of it and say , Come out and listen to the evening paper , you prisoners ! 
 Charles Evremonde , also known as Darnay ! 
 This is how the evening paper began at La Force Prison . 
 When someone's name was called , the person would step forward into an area reserved for him . Charles Evremonde , also known as Darnay , already knew this . He had seen hundred of people go to their deaths this way . 
 The swollen jailer , who wore reading glasses , glanced over them to make sure Darnay had stepped forward , and then went through the rest of the list . He would pause briefly after each name to make sure the person stepped forward . There were twenty-three names , but only twenty people answered . One of the prisoners whose names was called had already died in jail and been forgotten . Two had already been sent to the guillotine and also forgotten . The jailer read the list in the hall with the vaulted ceilings where Darnay had seen the group of prisoners the night he arrived in prison . Every one of those prisoners had died in the massacre . Every person he had since cared about in prison had died at the guillotine . 
 People quickly said goodbyes and kind words to those whose names were called , but this was over soon . This happened every day , and the prisoners of La Force Prison were busy preparing for some games and a concert that night . They crowded toward the prison grates and cried there , but twenty people in the games and concert now had to be replaced . Soon they would be locked up and guard dogs would be patrolling the common rooms and hallways during the night . The prisoners weren't unsympathetic or heartless . Their behavior came from the conditions in which they lived . In a similar way , though with a subtle difference , a type of excitement or intoxication was known to have led some people to die at the guillotine unnecessarily . It wasn't simply boastfulness . It was as if the public were all infected and had gone mad . When there is a plague some people will be secretly attracted to the disease and will want to die of it . All of us have similar strange desires in our hearts that are only waiting for the right circumstances to reveal themselves . 
 The passageway to the Conciergerie was short and dark . The night was cold and passed slowly in the rat-infested cells . The next day , fifteen prisoners were brought in front of the tribunal before Charles Darnay's name was called . All fifteen were sentenced to death . The trials of all of them together only took an hour and a half . 
 Charles Evremonde , also known as Darnay , was finally brought before the court . 
 The presiding judges wore feathered hats , but the rough red cap and three-colored cockade of the Revolution was what most other people wore . Looking at the jury and the rowdy audience , it seemed that the usual order of things had been reversed . It looked like the criminals were trying the honest men . The lowest , meanest , worst peopleof a city filled with low , mean , bad peoplewere in charge . The crowd was commenting loudly , applauding , talking amongst themselves , and influencing the outcome of the trial nonstop . Most of the men were armed in one way or another , and some of the women had knives or daggers on them . Some of them ate and drank as they watched , and many of them knitted . Among the women knitting , there was one woman who had a spare piece of knitting under her arm as she worked . She was in the front row next to a man whom Darnay hadn't seen since he first arrived at the barrier into Paris . He remembered that the man was Defarge . Darnay noticed that the woman had whispered in his ear once or twice and that she seemed to be his wife . But what he noticed most about the two of them was that , although they were as close to him as someone could get , they never looked at him . They seemed to be waiting for something intently . They looked at the jury , but they didn't look anywhere else . Dr . Manette sat next to the president of the tribunal , dressed modestly as usual . As far as Darnay could tell , Dr . Manette and Mr . Lorry were the only men there who weren't part of the tribunal . They wore their usual clothes and were not wearing the Revolutionary costume of the red cap and three colors . 
 The public prosecutor accused Charles Evremonde , also known as Darnay , of being an emigrant . The prosecutor said that Darnay's life belonged to the Republic of France under the decree that banished all emigrants on pain of death . It didn't matter that the decree was announced after he had returned to France . All that mattered was that Darnay was here in France and this is what the decree said . He had been captured in France and therefore had to have his head cut off . 
 Cut off his head ! yelled the crowd . He is an enemy of the Republic ! 
 The president rang his bell to silence the crowd and asked the prisoner if it was true that he had lived in England for many years . 
 Darnay said it was true . 
 The president asked if that made him an emigrant , and if not , what then did he call himself . 
 Darnay said he was not an emigrant , he hoped , as the law defines it . 
 The president asked why not . 
 He said because he had given up his title by choice . He didn't want it , or the position as a marquis . He left France to make his own living in England rather than live off the work of the overworked people of France . 
 The president asked him what proof he had of this . 
 Darnay handed them the names of two witnesses : Theophile Gabelle and Alexandre Manette . 
 The president reminded him that he had married in England . 
 Darnay said it was true , but he hadn't married an English woman . 
 The president asked if the woman was French . 
 He said yes , that she was French by birth . 
 The president asked her name and who her family was . 
 Darnay answered that her name is Lucie Manette . She is the only daughter of Dr . Manette , the good doctor who is sitting here . 
 The crowd was pleased by this answer , and they cheered Dr . Manette , who was well known as a good doctor . The crowd was so fickle that several ferocious individuals , who had been glaring at Darnay a moment before as if they wanted to drag him out into the street and kill him , were now crying for him . 
 Dr . Manette had instructed Charles Darnay to say these things , hoping they would help get him released . The doctor had also instructed him on everything Darnay needed to do next . 
 The president asked why he had returned to France when he did , and not sooner . 
 Darnay said he did not return sooner simply because he had no way of making a living in France except by the ways he had given up . In England he made a living by teaching French and French literature . He returned when he did after receiving an urgent letter from a French citizen , who told Darnay that his absence had put the citizen's life in danger . He came back to save a French citizen's life and to face the truth , whatever personal danger it placed him in . He asked if that were a crime in the eyes of the Republic . 
 The crowd yelled enthusiastically , No ! The president rang his bell to quiet them . It didn't quiet them , though , for they continued to yell No ! until they quieted down on their own . 
 The president asked the name of that citizen . Darnay explained that the citizen was his first witness . He also referred to the citizen's letter and explained that the letter had been taken from him at the barrier into Paris , but that he believed it was likely there in the papers that the president had in front of him . 
 The doctor had made sure that the letter was there . He had assured Darnay that it would definitely be there . Now it was taken out and read , and they called Citizen Gabelle to the stand to confirm the letter . He did so . Citizen Gabelle hinted delicately and politely that since the tribunal was so busy dealing with the many enemies of the Republic , he had been overlooked in Abbaye Prison . In fact , the tribunal had forgotten him entirely until three days ago , when he had been called in front of the court . The jury had released him when they decided that his accusation had been resolved when citizen Evremonde , also known as Darnay , had been captured . 
 Dr . Manette was questioned next . His popularity and his clear answers made a good impression on the court , but he continued on and told the court that Darnay was the first friend he made after he was freed from his long prison term and that Darnay had stayed in England . He told them that Darnay had always stayed faithful and devoted to Lucie and himself while they were in England . He told them that he was so far from being sympathetic with the aristocratic government of England that he was actually put on trial for his life by it as a foe of England and a friend of the United States . After Dr . Manette had presented these circumstances , discretely and straightforwardly , the jury and the crowd all agreed . Finally , when he appealed to Mr . Lorry , an English gentleman who was there in the courtroom , who , like himself , had witnessed that trial in England and could confirm his story about it , the jury declared that they had heard enough and that they were ready to vote if the president were ready to hear them . 
 The men on the jury voted aloud one at a time . Every time one of them announced his vote the crowd would shout and applaud . All of them voted in favor of the prisoner , and the president declared that Darnay was free . 
 Then the crowd started to act in a way that satisfied their fickleness and their desire to be generous and merciful . Or perhaps it was a way to balance their anger and violence . It's impossible to tell what motivated this behavior . It was probably a combination of all three , but the urge to be generous and merciful . As soon as Darnay was acquitted , people started crying . So many men and women embraced Darnay that he was in danger of fainting from exhaustion . It was just as disturbing to him since he knew very well that those same people could have been rushing at him with the same intensity to tear him to pieces and spread his body over the streets . 
 He was rescued from these embraces when he was removed to make room for other prisoners who were to be put on trial . Five people were going to be tried together next . They were accused of being enemies of the Republic because they had not said or done anything to help the Revolution . The tribunal acted so quickly to make up for the fact that they didn't get to kill Darnay that these five were sentenced to death before Darnay had left . They were sentenced to die within the next twenty-four hours . The first of the five prisoners told Darnay by showing him a raised finger , which was the sign used in prison to signify death . All five of them added , Long live the Republic ! 
 There had been no audience in the court to drag out the proceedings for the five prisoners . When Dr . Manette came out of the gate , there was a large crowd around it . It seemed to him that everyone that he had seen in the courtroom was there , except for Monsieur and Madame Defarge . He couldn't find them anywhere . When he came out , the crowd charged at him all over again . They kept crying , embracing him , and shouting , all alone or all together until the people , who were standing on a riverbank , all seemed to be as mad as the rushing water in the river . 
 They put Darnay into a large chair , which was either taken from the courtroom or from one of the court's rooms or hallways . They had thrown a red flag over it and had tied a pike with a red cap on top to the back of the chair . Ignoring the doctor's pleas , they carried Darnay home on their shoulders . The crowd , with their worn faces and red caps , made Darnay think more than once that he was confused and that he was actually in a cart on his way to be executed at the guillotine . 
 They carried him through the streets , embracing people along the way and pointing Darnay out to them . It was like a wild , dreamlike parade . They turned the snow red with their Republican colors , juast as they had reddened the snow with blood . They carried Darnay into the courtyard of the building where he lived . Dr . Manette had gone ahead to prepare Lucie , and when Darnay got off of the chair and stood on his own feet , Lucie fainted in his arms . 
 He held her to his chest and turned her beautiful face toward him so that he could kiss her unseen . He kissed her , crying . A few people in the crowd started to dance . Instantly , the rest of the crowd started dancing . The courtyard was filled with people dancing the Carmagnole . Then they picked up a young woman from the crowd and carried her around like she was the goddess of liberty . The crowd flowed out into the nearby streets , along the riverbank , and over the bridge , dancing the Carmagnole . 
 Darnay shook Dr . Manette's hand as he stood there , victorious and proud in front of them . He shook Mr . Lorry's hand when Mr . Lorry came in panting after fighting his way through the Carmagnole . He kissed little Lucie , who was lifted up by Miss Pross so she could put her arms around his neck . He embraced Miss Pross , who was always excited and faithful to them . Then he took Lucie in his arms and carried her up to their rooms . 
 Lucie ! My love ! I am safe . 
 Oh , dearest Charles , let me thank God for this on my knees the way I have been praying to Him . 
 They all bowed their heads in prayer . When she was in Darnay's arms again , he said to her : 
 And now speak to your father , my dear . No other man in all of France could have done what he has done for me . 
 She laid her head on her father's chest the way she had laid his head on her chest long ago in the attic in Saint Antoine . He was happy that he could repay her for all she'd done . He felt paid back for all his suffering , and he was proud of his strength . You mustn't be weak , darling , he told her . Don't tremble like that . I have saved him . 
 I have saved him , he heard Dr . Manette say . He'd had dreams in which he had been released , but this wasn't a dream . He was really here . But still Lucie trembled , and was very afraid something else might happen . 
 The air around them was thick and dark . The people were so desperate for revenge and unpredictable that innocent people were constantly executed on vague suspicions or out of pure hatred . Lucie found it impossible to forget that people as innocent as her husband and just as loved by others were killed everyday . Her husband had been saved , but still she could not feel as relieved by his release as she should have . It was getting late in the wintry afternoon , and the carts carrying people to the guillotine were rolling through the streets . Lucie thought about those people , imagining Charles in one of those carts among those condemned to die . She clung to him closer and trembled more . 
 Her father tried to cheer her up . He showed compassion and strength , compared to Lucie's weakness , that was wonderful to see . No attic and no shoemaking now ! He wasn't prisoner One Hundred and Five , North Tower , now ! He had achieved what he set out to achieve . He had fulfilled his promise to save Charles , and showed they could all depend on him . 
 They lived a thrifty lifestyle , not only because it was the safest way to live and would not offend the common people , but because they were not rich . While Charles was in prison , he'd had to pay a great sum of money for his bad food and for his guard , and fore the care of the poorer prisoners . Partly for this reason , and partly because they didn't want someone spying on their daily lives , the Manettes didn't have any servants . The citizen and citizenesses who served as porters at the courtyard gate ran errands for them occasionally , and Mr . Lorry had almost entirely passed Jerry onto them now . He was on call for them every day and he slept there every night . 
 It was a law of the Republic , One and Indivisible of Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death , that the names of every person living in a house be written on the door or doorpost . The sign had to be written in letters of a certain size and at a certain height from the ground . Mr . Jerry Cruncher's name , therefore , was written on the doorpost down at the bottom . As it grew later in the day and the shadows deepened , Mr . Cruncher himself arrived . He had been overseeing a painter whom Dr . Manette had hired to add Charles Evremonde , also known as Darnay , to the list of names on the door . 
 Fear and distrust existed everywhere at that time , and all of the usual innocent ways of life had changed . In Dr . Manette's household , as in many others , food and supplies for the day were bought every evening in small amounts from different small shops . Everyone did their best to avoid attracting attention . Everyone wanted to avoid talking to others or making other people envious . 
 For several months now , Miss Pross and Mr . Cruncher had been in charge of getting supplies . Miss Pross would carry the money and Jerry would carry the basket . They would go out shopping every afternoon around the time when the streetlamps were lit , and they would buy and bring home whatever they needed . Miss Pross could have known as much French as English by now if she'd wanted , having lived with a French family for a long time , but she had no desire to . Therefore , she knew no more of that French nonsense (as she liked calling it) than Jerry did . So her way of shopping was to just say the name of what she wanted without any other conversation . If it didn't happen to be the right word , she would look around for the thing she wanted , grab it , and hold onto it until she had paid for it . She always bargained the price down by holding up one finger less than the number the shopkeeper held up . 
 Now , Mr . Cruncher , said Miss Pross , her eyes red from crying tears of joy , I am ready if you are . 
 Jerry told Miss Pross in his hoarse voice that he was ready . He had worn all of the rust off of his fingers a long time ago , but he still had spiked hair . 
 We need all sorts of things , said Miss Pross . And we will have a hard time getting them . We need wine along with everything else . These patriots in their red caps will be toasting and celebrating wherever we buy it . 
 It will all be the same to you , miss , if they toast to your health or to the Old One's , answered Jerry . 
 Who's he ? asked Miss Pross . 
 Mr . Cruncher , with some hesitancy , explained that he meant the devil . 
 Ha ! said Miss Pross . You don't need an interpreter to explain what these people mean . It's always darkness , murder , and mischief . 
 Quiet ! Please , please be careful what you say ! cried Lucie . 
 Yes , yes , yes , I'll be cautious , said Miss Pross . But I can say privately that I hope there aren't peasants smelling of onions and tobacco embracing each other everywhere in the streets . Now , Lucie , don't move from that fire until I come back ! Take care of the dear husband who has returned to you , and keep your pretty head on his shoulder , like it is now , until I get back . May I ask a question , Dr . Manette , before I go ? 
 I think you can take that liberty , the doctor answered , smiling . 
 For goodness sake , don't talk about liberty . We have quite enough of that , said Miss Pross . 
 Quiet ! Again ? Lucie protested . 
 Well , my sweet , said Miss Pross , nodding her head vigorously . To make a long story short , I am British and a subject of His Most Gracious Majesty King George the Third . Miss Pross curtseyed when she said the name . I say 'Confound their politics , Frustrate their knavish tricks , On him our hopes we fix , God save the King ! ' lines from the song God Save the King , the national anthem of the United Kingdom 'Confound their politics , Frustrate their knavish tricks , On him our hopes we fix , God save the King ! ' . 
 Mr . Cruncher , being excessively patriotic , repeated the words in his hoarse voice as if he were at church . 
 I am glad that you take so much pride in being an Englishman , although I wish you had never caught that cold that makes your voice so hoarse , said Miss Pross approvingly . But the question is , Dr . Manette , is there any hope yet of us getting out of Paris ? Miss Pross had a way of talking about serious matters as if they weren't serious at all . She would mention them casually , as if they just happened to come up in conversation . 
 Not yet , I'm afraid . It would still be dangerous for Charles . 
 Hey-ho-hum ! said Miss Pross , cheerfully suppressing a sigh as she looked at Lucie's blond hair in the light of the fire . Then we must be patient and wait . That's all we can do . We must hold our heads up and fight , as my brother , Solomon , used to say . Let's go now , Mr . Cruncher ! Stay here and don't move , Lucie ! 
 They went out , leaving Lucie , Charles , the doctor , and little Lucie by a bright fire . Mr . Lorry was expected to return soon from Tellson's Bank . Miss Pross had lit a lamp but had put it aside in a corner so that they could enjoy the light of the fire . Little Lucie sat by the doctor with her hands through his arm . The doctor , speaking in a tone just above a whisper , began to tell her a story about a great and powerful fairy . The fairy had opened a prison wall and rescued a prisoner who had once done the fairy a favor . Everything was calm and quiet , and Lucie was calmer than she had been before . 
 What's that ? she yelled out suddenly . 
 My dear ! said the doctor , stopping his story and taking her hand . Get a hold of yourself . You're so anxious ! The smallest thing , even nothing , startles you ! You , your father's daughter ! 
 Father , I thought I heard strangers coming up the stairs , said Lucie , explaining herself . Her face was pale and her voice quavered . 
 Lucie , the staircase is as quiet as death . As he said the last word , someone knocked on the door . 
 Oh , Father , Father ! Who can this be ? Hide Charles . Save him ! 
 My child , said the doctor , getting up and putting his hand on her shoulder . I have saved him . How weak you are , my dear ! Let me go to the door . 
 He picked up the lamp , walked through the two outer rooms , and opened the door . He heard the sound of footsteps hurrying over the floor , and four rough men in red caps entered the room with sabers and pistols . 
 We're looking for the Citizen Evremonde , also known as Darnay , said the first man . 
 Who's looking for him ? 
 I'm looking for him . We're all looking for him . I know you , Evremonde . I saw you brought before the tribunal today . You are again a prisoner of the Republic . 
 The four men surrounded Charles , who stood where he was with Lucie and their daughter clinging to him . 
 Tell me why I am a prisoner again ? 
 It's enough for you to know that you are to be taken straight back to the Conciergerie . They will tell you why tomorrow when you are summoned before the tribunal again . 
 Dr . Manette was frozen as if he had been turned to stone , and he stood holding the lamp as if he were a statue that was made to hold it . He moved after the man spoke these words and put down the lamp . He confronted the man , firmly grabbing the loose front of his red woolen shirt , and said : 
 You say you know Charles Darnay . Do you know me ? 
 Yes , I know you , Citizen Doctor . 
 We all know you , Citizen Doctor , said the other three men . 
 The doctor looked confusedly from one man to another . After a pause he lowered his voice and said : 
 Will you answer Charles's questions for me then ? Why is this happening ? 
 Citizen Doctor , said the first , reluctantly , he has been accused by the people of Saint Antoine . This citizen is from Saint Antoine . He pointed out the second man who had come in with them . 
 The second man nodded his head and added : 
 He has been accused by the people of Saint Antoine . 
 Accused of what ? 
 Don't ask any more questions , said the first man reluctantly . If the Republic needs you to make sacrifices , then I'm sure you , as a good patriot , will be happy to make them . The Republic is more important than anything else . The people come first . Evremonde , let's go . We are in a hurry . 
 One more thing , the doctor asked . Will you tell me who accused him ? 
 It's against the rules for me to tell you , answered the first man . But you can ask the man from Saint Antoine here . 
 The doctor turned and looked at the man . The man shifted uneasily on his feet and rubbed his beard a little . After a while he said : 
 Well ! It really is against the rules , but he has been accusedand seriouslyby Monsieur and Madame Defarge . And by one other person . 
 Who was the other person ? 
 Are you asking me , Citizen Doctor ? 
 Yes . 
 Then you will get your answer tomorrow , said the man from Saint Antoine with a strange look . For now , I say no more ! 
 Happily unaware that Charles was being taken back to prison , Miss Pross made her way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the Pont-Neuf bridge . She thought about the number of essential items she needed to buy . Mr . Cruncher walked beside her carrying the basket , and they both looked to the right and left into the shops they walked by . They kept an eye out for excited groups of people . If they saw any , they would leave the road to avoid them . It was a cold evening . The misty river was blurred with the reflection of blazing lights and its sound drowned out by the noise of the barges , where the smiths made guns for the Army of the Republic . Woe to the man who challenged that army ! The guillotine , called the national razor , would shave his head right off . 
 Miss Pross bought a few small grocery items and some lamp oil , then thought about what wine they wanted . After looking into several wine shops , she stopped at a shop whose sign was of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity the Brutus who helped to found the Roman Republic and assassinate Julius Caesar Brutus of Antiquity . It wasn't far from the Tuileries Palace , where the look of everything interested Miss Pross . The wine shop looked quieter than any other similar place they had passed . Even though there were many patriotic red caps there , it wasn't as full as some other places . She asked Mr . Cruncher if he thought they should go inside , and he agreed , so Miss Pross and her escort entered . 
 The lights inside were dim , and people were smoking pipes and playing games with worn decks of cards and yellow dominoes . One bare-chested , bare-armed workman was covered in soot and reading a journal out loud . Other people listened to him . People wore weapons on them , or had set them down nearby where they could be easily reached . Two or three customers had slumped forward , asleep . They wore shaggy black spencers short jackets spencers that were popular at the time and made them look like sleeping bears or dogs . Miss Pross and Jerry , looking out of place in this setting , approached the counter and showed what they wanted . 
 As their wine was being measured out , a man got up from a corner where he had been sitting with another man and started to leave . As he went out , he came face-to-face with Miss Pross . As soon as he faced her , Miss Pross screamed and clapped her hands . 
 Immediately everyone in the shop was standing up . They all assumed there had been an argument and somebody had been killed . They expected to see somebody fall down dead , but they only saw a man and a woman standing there , staring at each other . The man looked like a Frenchman and a patriotic Republican , and the woman was evidently English . 
 The customers were disappointed that this exchange only resulted in talk . The customers of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity wine shop all started talking loudly . Even though they listened carefully , Miss Pross and Jerry understood so little of what they were saying that they could have been speaking Hebrew or Chaldean a dialect of modern Aramaic Chaldean . Miss Pross and Jerry were too surprised to try to understand any of this . For not only was Miss Pross amazed and annoyed , but Mr . Cruncher , for his own reasons , was amazed too . 
 What is the matter ? said the man who had caused Miss Pross to scream . He spoke quickly , quietly , and in English . 
 Oh , Solomon ! My dear Solomon ! cried Miss Pross , clapping her hands again . I haven't seen or heard from you for so long , and now I find you here ! 
 Don't call me Solomon . Do you want to get me killed ? asked the man in a secretive , frightened way . 
 Brother , brother ! cried Miss Pross , bursting into tears . Have I ever treated you so badly that you can ask me such a cruel question ? 
 Then stop talking and come outside if you want to speak to me , said Solomon . Pay for your wine and come outside . Who's this man ? 
 Miss Pross shook her head dejectedly at her cold-hearted brother and said through her tears . This is Mr . Cruncher . 
 He can come outside too , said Solomon . Does he think I'm a ghost ? 
 Mr . Cruncher did , in fact , look like he had seen a ghost , but he didn't say a word . Fighting back her tears , Miss Pross looked through her reticule a small purse made of netting or lightweight fabric usually closed by a drawstring reticule and with great difficulty paid for the wine . As she did so , Solomon turned to the customers in the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity wine shop and offered them an explanation in French . This made them all go back to what they had been doing . 
 Now , what do you want ? asked Solomon , stopping at the dark street corner . 
 You are my brother , and I have always loved you , cried Miss Pross . How cruel it is for you to greet me this way and be so cold to me . 
 There , confound it ! There , said Solomon , kissing her on the lips quickly . Now are you happy ? 
 Miss Pross shook her head and cried silently . 
 If you expect me to be surprised , I'm not , said her brother . I knew you were here . I know about most people who are here . If you don't want to put my life in dangerand I half think you dogo your way as soon as possible , and let me go mine . I am busy . I am an official now . 
 My English brother , Solomon , said Miss Pross sadly , looking up at him with tear-filled eyes , who could have been one of the greatest men in England , is an official among foreigners ! And such awful foreigners ! I'd almost rather have seen you dead and lying in your grave . 
 I told you ! cried her brother , interrupting her . I knew it . You want to get me killed . I'll be made a suspect by my own sister . Just as I am starting to do well for myself ! 
 Heaven forbid ! cried Miss Pross . I would rather never see you again , dear Solomon , though I have always loved you and always will . Say just one kind word to me and tell me there is no anger or conflict between us and I will let you go . 
 Good Miss Pross ! As if any conflict between them had been her fault . As if Mr . Lorry had not known years ago in their house on the quiet corner in Soho that her precious brother , Solomon , had spent all of her money and abandoned her ! 
 Solomon said his kind word to her , but in such a condescending and patronizing way that it seemed as if their positions in life were reversed (which is usually how it works , all over the world) . Mr . Cruncher tapped him on the shoulder and interrupted unexpectedly . He asked him a question in his usual hoarse voice : 
 May I ask you a question ? Is you name John Solomon ? Or Solomon John ? 
 Solomon turned toward him with sudden distrust . Mr . Cruncher hadn't said a word until now . 
 Come on ! Speak up , said Mr . Cruncher (who , with his hoarse voice , couldn't speak up himself) . John Solomon , or Solomon John ? She calls you Solomon , and she must know since she's your sister . And I know that your name is John . Which name goes first ? And what about the name Pross too ? That wasn't your name back in England . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Well , I don't know exactly what I mean , because I can't remember what your name was back in England . 
 No ? 
 No . But I'll swear it was a name with two syllables in it . 
 Indeed ? 
 Yes . The other name was one syllable . I know you . You were a spy who acted as a witness at the Bailey . In the name of the Father of Lies the devil Father of Lies , who was your father too , what name were you called back then ? 
 Barsad , said someone else , joining in . 
 That's it ! I'd bet a thousand pounds on it ! cried Jerry . 
 The man who had joined in was Sydney Carton . He had his hands behind him under his riding coat , and he stood beside Mr . Cruncher as casually as he might have stood at the court of the Old Bailey . 
 Don't be alarmed , my dear Miss Pross . I arrived at Mr . Lorry's and surprised him last night . We agreed that I wouldn't make my presence known to anyone else until all was well or until I could be of use . I am showing myself here so I can ask your brother to have a little talk with me . I wish you had a brother with a more respectable job than Mr . Barsad . I wish for your sake that Mr . Barsad wasn't a prison sheep . 
 Sheep was prison slang for spy at the time . Solomon , known as the spy Barsad , was pale , and he turned even paler and asked Mr . Carton how he dared
 I'll tell you , said Sydney . I saw you coming out of the prison of the Conciergerie while I was looking at the walls an hour or more ago , Mr . Barsad . You have a memorable face , and I remember faces well . I was curious to see why you were there . Since I have good reason , as you know , to associate you with the misfortunes of our poor friend Charles Darnay , I followed you . I walked into the wine shop here right after you and sat near you . By overhearing your conversation and hearing the rumors going around openly among your admirers here , I had no trouble figuring out that you are a spy . And gradually , my random decision to follow you seemed to have a purpose , Mr . Barsad . 
 What purpose ? the spy asked . 
 It would be difficult and dangerous to explain in the street . Could you do me the favor of meeting with me for a few minutes in secret , at the office of Tellson's Bank for instance ? 
 Are you threatening me ? 
 Oh ! Did I say that ? 
 If you're not threatening me , why should I go there ? 
 Really , Mr . Barsad . I can't tell you why if you don't already know . 
 Do you mean that you won't tell me why , sir ? asked the spy uncertainly . 
 You understand me very well , Mr . Barsad . I won't tell you . 
 Carton's casual manner helped his quickness and skill in putting his secret plan into action and dealing with a man like Barsad . He noticed this advantage and used it . 
 Now I told you , said the spy , looking accusingly at Miss Pross , if I get into any trouble because of this , it's your fault . 
 Come , come , Mr . Barsad , exclaimed Sydney . Don't be ungrateful . If it weren't for the great respect I have for your sister , I might not have presented my little proposal so nicely . I think it will benefit both of us . Will you go with me to the bank ? 
 I'll listen to what you have to say . Yes , I'll go with you . 
 I suggest that we escort your sister to the corner of her street first . Let me take your arm , Miss Pross . This isn't a good city for you to be out unprotected at this time . And as Mr . Cruncher knows Mr . Barsad , I will invite him to Mr . Lorry's with us . Are we ready ? Come on then ! 
 Miss Pross remembered soon afterward , and to the end of her life , that as she put her hands on Sydney's arm , looked into his face , and begged him not to hurt Solomon , there was strength of purpose in the arm and an inspired look in his eyes . These were not only a contradiction to his casual manner , but they changed him and made him look more respectable . She was too occupied then with her fears about her brother , who was so undeserving of her love , and with Sydney's friendly assurances , to pay attention to the change she saw in him . 
 They left her on her street corner . Carton led the way to Mr . Lorry's office , which was a few minutes away . John Barsad , also known as Solomon Pross , walked beside him . 
 Mr . Lorry had just finished his dinner and was sitting in front of a cheerful little fire . Perhaps he was looking in the flames for the image of his younger self who had looked into the red coals at the Royal George Hotel in Dover many years ago . He turned his head as they entered and looked surprised when he saw the stranger , Barsad . 
 This is Mr . Barsad , sir . He is Miss Pross's brother , said Sydney . 
 Barsad ? repeated Mr . Lorry . Barsad ? I know the name . And the face . 
 I told you that you had a memorable face , Mr . Barsad , said Carton , coolly . Please sit down . 
 As he took a chair , he supplied the information Mr . Lorry was looking for by saying with a frown , I was a witness at that trial . Mr . Lorry remembered immediately and looked at Mr . Barsad with a clear look of hatred . 
 Mr . Barsad was recognized by Miss Pross . He is the ëloving brother' that you have heard about , said Sydney . He has admitted it . I also have worse news . Darnay has been arrested again . 
 Mr . Lorry was shocked . What are you telling me ! he exclaimed . When I left him two hours ago , he was safe and free . I was about to return to him ! 
 Arrested just the same . When was he arrested , Mr . Barsad ? 
 Just now , if he was already arrested . 
 Mr . Barsad would know best , sir , said Sydney . I heard him say to a friend who was another spy over a bottle of wine at the wine shop that he has already been arrested . Barsad left the messengers at Darnay's gate and saw them let in by the porter . There is no doubt that he has been arrested again . 
 Mr . Lorry's business-minded eye could see by looking at Barsad's face that it would just waste time to talk about it further . He was confused but could tell that something might depend on his having a clear head . He pulled himself together and listened carefully . 
 Now I trust that Dr . Manette's name and influence may help him as much tomorrow said Sydney . You said he would be brought before the tribunal again tomorrow , Mr . Barsad ? 
 Yes , I think so . 
 Dr . Manette's name will help him as much tomorrow as it did today , but that might not be true . I admit , Mr . Lorry , that I am shaken by the fact that Dr . Manette didn't have the power to stop his arrest . 
 He might not have known about it beforehand , said Mr . Lorry . 
 But that's alarming when you remember how close everyone knows he is with Darnay . 
 That's true , Mr . Lorry agreed , troubled . He rubbed his chin with his hand and looked at Carton . 
 In short , said Sydney , this is a desperate time , when desperate games are played for desperate stakes . Winning Darnay's freedom is like a card game . Let the doctor play the winning hand . I'll play the losing one . No man's life here is worth anything . Anyone can be carried home by the people in celebration one day and condemned to die the next . Now , in case Dr . Manette can't help him and Darnay is sentenced to death , I have decided to try to win over a friend in the Conciergerie . The friend I want to win over is Mr . Barsad . 
 You'll need good cards to win me over , sir , said Barsad . 
 I'll look them over and see what I hold . Mr . Lorry , you know what a brute I am and I how much I like to drink . Please give me a little brandy . 
 Brandy was put in front of him and he drank a whole glass . Then he drank another glass and pushed the bottle away from him thoughtfully . 
 Mr . Barsad , he continued , as if he really were looking over a hand of cards . You are a prison spy and a representative of Republican committees . You've been at one time a prison guard and at one time a prisoner . You've always been a spy and secret informer . You are much more valuable here in France for being English because an Englishman is less likely to be suspected of corruption than a Frenchman is . You present yourself to your employers under a false name . That's a very good card . Mr . Barsad , now employed by the Republican French government , was formerly employed by the aristocratic English government , which was the enemy of France and freedom . That's an excellent card . Everyone is so suspicious in Paris these days that it would be easy to suggest that Mr . Barsad is still in the pay of the aristocratic English government and is a spy for Pitt William Pitt the Younger , who was prime minister of England at the time Pitt . I could accuse you of being an enemy of the Republic working right in the middle of it . I could accuse you of being an English traitor and a spy . Everyone says that there are traitors and spies around , although they are so difficult to actually find . That's a card that beats all . Are you following me , Mr . Barsad ? 
 I don't understand what you plan to do , answered Barsad , uneasily . 
 I plan to play my ace and denounce you , Mr . Barsad , to the closest Section Committee . Look over your hand , Mr . Barsad , and see what cards you have to play . Take your time . 
 Mr . Carton pulled the bottle of brandy toward him , poured himself another glass , and drank it . He saw that Barsad was worried he would get drunk and want to denounce Barsad immediately . Seeing this , Carton poured another glass and drank it . 
 Look over your cards carefully , Mr . Barsad . Take your time . 
 Barsad's cards were worse than he thought . Mr . Barsad had losing cards in his hand that Sydney Carton didn't even know about . He had been thrown out of his job as a spy in England after much unsuccessful hard worknot because he was not wanted there (our English ideas about how much better the English are at secrecy and spying are the same as they are today) . He had crossed the Channel and taken a job in France . First he had baited Englishmen in France into incriminating themselves and had listened in on their conversations . Then he started doing the same among the French . He knew that he had worked for the now-overthrown French government spying on the people of Saint Antoine and on Defarge's wine shop . He heard news from the police about Dr . Manette's imprisonment , release , and his personal history . This information had helped him get to know Monsieur and Madame Defarge . He had tried to use this information on Madame Defarge , but it hadn't worked . He always remembered with fear and trembling that Madame Defarge had been knitting while she talked with him , and she had stared threateningly at him while she knitted . He had seen her since then in that section of Saint Antoine , showing the list of names she had knitted and denouncing people , who shortly after died on the guillotine . He knew , as all spies knew , that he was never safe . It was impossible to run away . He was stuck there and in danger for his life . He knew that , despite the fact that he had switched sides and now helped the Republic , one word against him might lead to his downfall . He foresaw that once he was denounced and in the dilemma Mr . Carton had just described , Madame Defarge would present her list against him , and it would surely lead to his death . All men that live secret lives are easily terrified . He had enough bad cards to make him furious as he looked them over . 
 You don't seem to like your cards , said Sydney calmly . Will you play your hand ? 
 Mr . Lorry , said Barsad , angrily , turning to him . You are a kind , old gentleman . Will you please ask Mr . Carton , who is so much younger than you , whether he can reconcile it to himself to do what he says he'll do ? I admit that I am a spy and that this is a shameful job , though somebody has to do it . But this gentleman isn't a spy . Why should he demean himself by accusing me ? 
 I will play my ace in a few minutes and accuse you , Mr . Barsad , without any doubts , said Carton , answering himself and looking at his watch . 
 I would have hoped that the respect you both have for my sister said Barsad , who kept trying to bring Mr . Lorry into the discussion . 
 There is no better way for me to prove that I respect your sister than to finally relieve her of her brother , said Sydney Carton . 
 There isn't , sir ? asked Barsad . 
 I have completely made my mind up about it , answered Carton . 
 Barsad's smooth manner was strangely at odds with his showily ragged clothes and his usual behavior . But he was so thrown off by Carton , who was a mystery to smarter , more honest men than Barsad , that he didn't know what to say . While he was trying to decide what to do next , Carton said , as if looking over his cards again : 
 Now that I think about it , I'm pretty sure I have another good card here that I haven't mentioned yet . That friend and fellow spy who said he spends time in the prisons . Who was he ? 
 He's French . You don't know him , said Barsad , quickly . 
 French , huh ? repeated Carton , thinking it over . He didn't seem to notice Barsad at all , although he repeated the word after him . Well , he might be . 
 He is , I assure you , said Barsad . Though it's not important . 
 Though it's not important , repeated Carton automatically as before . Though it's not important . No . It's not important . No . Yet I know his face . 
 I don't think so . I'm sure you don't . You can't , said Barsad . 
 I can't , muttered Sydney Carton , thinking and twirling his glass again . Fortunately , it was a small glass . I can't . He spoke good French . But he spoke it like a foreigner , didn't he ? 
 He's from the countryside , said Barsad . 
 No . He's foreign ! cried Carton , hitting the table with his open hand as it became clear to him . Cly ! He was disguised , but that was Cly . That man was at the trial at the Old Bailey . 
 Now , you are rushing to a conclusion , said Barsad with a smile that made his beaklike nose curve to one side . There you really give me an advantage . I will fully admit that Cly was my partner a long time ago . But Cly has been dead for several years . I saw him on his deathbed . He was buried in London at the church of Saint Pancras-in-the-Fields . He was so unpopular with the people that I couldn't follow his funeral to the graveyard because of the mob , but I helped lay him in his coffin . 
 From where he was sitting , Mr . Lorry suddenly became aware of a strange goblin-like shadow on the wall . He looked to where it was coming from and discovered that it was caused by Mr . Cruncher's hair , which had suddenly risen and stiffened even more than usual . 
 Let's be reasonable , said Barsad . Let's be fair . To show you how wrong you are and that your assumptions have no basis of truth , I will show you Cly's death certificate , which I happen to have carried in my pocketbook ever since . He took it out quickly and opened it . There it is . Look at it ! Pick it up . It's not a forgery . 
 Mr . Lorry saw the shadow on the wall grow longer , and Mr . Cruncher stepped forward . His hair could not have been standing up any more if it had been arranged by the cow with the crumpled horn in the house that Jack built the quote , which describes a cowlick , is from This Is the House That Jack Built , by Mother Goose the cow with the crumpled horn in the house that Jack built . 
 Barsad didn't see Mr . Cruncher standing beside him , and Mr . Cruncher tapped him on the shoulder . 
 So you put Roger Cly in his coffin , master ? asked Mr . Cruncher , coldly . 
 I did . 
 Who took him out of it ? 
 Barsad leaned back in his chair . He said , stuttering , What do you mean ? 
 I mean that he was never in it , said Mr . Cruncher . No ! He wasn't . You can chop off my head if he was ever in it . 
 Barsad looked around at Mr . Carton and Mr . Lorry . They both looked at Jerry in astonishment . 
 I tell you that you buried cobblestones and dirt in that coffin , said Jerry . Don't tell me that you buried Cly . It was a scam . I and two more people know it . 
 How do you know ? 
 Why do you care , by God ! growled Mr . Cruncher . You're the person I have an old grudge against , aren't you ? Causing trouble for an honest businessman ? I'd choke you to death for half a guinea . 
 Sydney Carton and Mr . Lorry were amazed by this unexpected turn . Carton asked Mr . Cruncher to calm down and explain himself . 
 I'll explain some other time , sir , he answered evasively . Now is not the time to explain . I say that he knows full well that Cly was never in that coffin . Let him say one syllable of one word that he was , and I'll choke him to death for half a guinea Mr . Cruncher made this sound like a generous offer or I'll go outside and accuse him . 
 Humph ! I see one thing , said Carton . I hold another card , Mr . Barsad . There is a violent atmosphere , full of suspicion , here in Paris . It would be impossible for you to live through being accused of communicating with another aristocratic spy who has the same history as your own . Someone who also faked his own death and has come back to life again ! You will be accused of being a foreigner who was starting plots in the prisons against the Republic . That is a good card , a card that will certainly send you to the guillotine . Will you play your hand ? 
 No ! answered Barsad . I give up . I confess that we were so unpopular with the mob that I only got away from England at the risk of being drowned to death , and that Cly was being chased so much that he never would have gotten away if he hadn't faked his own death . Though how Mr . Cruncher knows that it was a scam I have no idea . 
 Don't worry about me , answered Mr . Cruncher angrily . You'll have enough trouble dealing with these two gentleman . And look here ! Once again ! Mr . Cruncher couldn't be stopped from showing off his generosity . I'd grab you by the throat and choke you for half a guinea . 
 Barsad , the prison spy , turned from Mr . Cruncher to Sydney Carton and said decisively , Let's get to the point . I go on duty soon and can't be late . You told me you had a proposal . What is it ? Now , it's no use asking too much from me . If you ask me to do anything as an official of the Republic that puts me in too much danger , it would be better for me take my chances and refuse you than to agree . In short , I will refuse you . You talk of desperation . Everyone is desperate . Remember ! I might denounce you if I think it's what I should do . I can lie very well , and so can others . Now , what do you want me to do ? 
 Not very much . You are a prison guard at the Conciergerie ? 
 I'll tell you for sure that there is no way to escape , said Barsad , firmly . 
 Why are you telling me what I didn't ask ? You are a guard at the Conciergerie ? 
 I am sometimes . 
 You can be a guard there when you want to be ? 
 I can go in and out when I choose . 
 Sydney Carton filled another glass with brandy and poured it slowly on the hearth of the fireplace . He watched it as it spilled out , and after it was all gone he said , getting up : 
 So far , we have spoken in front of these two because it made sense that this discussion wasn't just between the two of us . Now let's go into this dark room and have one final word alone . 
 Sydney Carton and Barsad were in the dark room next door , speaking so quietly that no sound was heard . Mr . Lorry looked at Jerry with doubt and mistrust . The way Cruncher , the honest businessman , reacted to this look didn't make Mr . Lorry any more confident . Cruncher shifted back and forth on his feet as often as if he had fifty feet and were standing on each of them . He looked at his fingernails a little too closely , and whenever Mr . Lorry looked him in the eye , Mr . Cruncher would cough and put his hand over his mouth like a man who was hiding something . 
 Come here , Jerry , said Mr . Lorry . 
 Mr . Cruncher came toward him , moving sideways and leading with one shoulder . 
 What job have you had , besides being a messenger ? 
 After thinking about it and looking intently at Mr . Lorry , Mr . Cruncher had the bright idea of answering , It's of an agricultural nature . 
 I am concerned that you have used the respectable and great Tellson's Bank as a cover , and that you have been doing something illegal . If you have , don't expect me to remain friendly with you when you get back to England . If you have , don't expect me to keep your secret . You cannot take advantage of Tellson's Bank . 
 I've had the honor of working for you until I've turned gray , so I hope that a gentleman like you would think twice about harming me . Even if what you say is trueI don't say that it is truebut if it was . And it should be taken into account that if it were true , there would be two sides to the story . There might be doctors right now earning guineas an English coin with a high value guineas when an honest businessman like me doesn't even earn farthings an English coin worth one-quarter of a penny farthings . Farthings ! No , not even half-farthings . Half-farthings ! No , not even quarter-farthings . These doctors come into Tellson's to do their banking and start giving me knowing looks on the sly as they go out to their private carriages . Well , they are imposing on Tellson's , too . You can't blame the goose and not the gander . And then there's Mrs . Cruncher to deal with , or at least I had to deal with her back in England . She's always flinging herself down and praying against my success so much that it ruins me . Ruins me ! Whereas those medical doctors' wives don't pray against them . Those doctors would catch them at it . Or if they pray , they pray for more patients , and how can you have one without the other ? Then , what with undertakers to bribe , and parish clerks , and sextons , and greedy private guards , a man wouldn't even earn that much . And what little a man did earn would never be enough to allow him to prosper , Mr . Lorry . Things would never be good for him . The whole time he'd want to give up that line of work , if he could find a way out of it after having already been in itif what you say is true . 
 Ugh ! cried Mr . Lorry , relenting , nevertheless . I am shocked at the sight of you . 
 Now , what I would like to offer you , sir , continued Mr . Cruncher , even if it was true , which I don't say it is
 Don't avoid the question , said Mr . Lorry . 
 No , I will not , sir , answered Mr . Cruncher as if nothing were further from his mind . I don't say that it is true . Here's my offer , sir . My boy is sitting on that stool there at Temple Bar . I brought him up and his has grown into a man . If you want , he will run errands and messages for you and do general small jobs for you until you're dead . If it was true , although I still don't say it isfor I won't avoid the subject , sirlet the boy take my place and work for you . Let him take care of his mother . Don't turn me in , sir , let me go into honest grave digging full-time and make up for the graves I dug upif it was trueby digging them legally and keeping them safe . That , Mr . Lorry , is what I respectfully offer you , sir , said Mr . Cruncher , wiping his forehead with his arm to show that he was finishing his speech . There are so many people having their heads cut off that it is bringing down the wages a man can earn as a porter . A man doesn't see all of these dreadful things going on around him without having serious thoughts about things , and these would be my thoughts . I beg you to remember that I said what I said about Mr . Barsad to help Mr . Darnay . I could have kept quiet . 
 At least that is true , said Mr . Lorry . Don't say any more for now . I might still be your friend , if you deserve it , and if you repent in action , not just in words . I don't want to hear any more words . 
 Mr . Cruncher was rubbing his forehead with his knuckle as Sydney Carton and Barsad came back from the dark room . Adieu , Mr . Barsad , said Carton . Now that we have made our arrangement , you don't have to be afraid of me . 
 He sat down in a chair by the fire near Mr . Lorry . When they were alone , Mr . Lorry asked him what he had done . 
 Not much . If things should go badly with Darnay in prison , I have made sure that we will be able to visit him once . 
 Mr . Lorry looked disappointed . 
 It's all I could do , said Carton . If I demanded too much of him , it would put his life in danger . As he said himself , the same thing would happen to him if he were denounced . It was the obvious weakness of my position . There is nothing to be done about it . 
 But if things go badly in front of the tribunal , going to visit him won't save him , said Mr . Lorry . 
 I never said that it would . 
 Mr . Lorry eventually looked back at the fire . The sympathy he had for Lucie and his disappointment over Darnay's second arrest gradually weakened him . He was an old man now . Lately he had been overwhelmed by anxiety , and he started to cry . 
 You are a good man and a true friend , said Carton . His voice sounded different . Forgive me if I notice that you are moved by this . If you were my father , I couldn't watch you weep and sit by without caring . And I could not respect your sorrow more if you were my own father . Fortunately for you , you are not my father . 
 Though he said the last words with a slip into his usual casual manner , there was sincerity in his tone and in his touch that Mr . Lorry didn't expect . He had never seen Carton's gentle side . Mr . Lorry gave Carton his hand , and Carton gently squeezed it . 
 To return to the subject of poor Darnay , said Carton . Don't tell Lucie about this conversation or the arrangement we have made . She won't be able to go see him . She might think that , in the worst case , it was arranged to bring him a way of killing himself before he was sent to the guillotine . 
 Mr . Lorry hadn't thought of that , and he looked quickly at Carton to see if that's what he was thinking . It seemed that it was , and Carton looked back at him as if they understood each other . 
 She might think a thousand different things , said Carton . Any of them would only make her worry more . Don't mention me to her . As I told you when I first arrived , it's better that I don't see her . I can reach out and do what little for her that I can without her seeing me . You are going to visit her , I hope ? She must be very unhappy tonight . 
 I am going there right now . 
 I'm glad . She's attached to you and relies on you . How does she look ? 
 Anxious and unhappy , but very beautiful . 
 Ah ! 
 Carton made a long , grieving sound , like a sighalmost like a sob . It made Mr . Lorry look at Carton's face , which was turned to the fire . A light , or a shadow (Mr . Lorry couldn't have said which) , passed over his face quickly . He used his foot to put back a small flaming log that had rolled forward in the fire . He wore a white riding coat and boots , which were in style then , an their light surfaces in the light of the fire made him look very pale . His long , uncut brown hair hung loosely around him . He didn't seem to notice the fire , and Mr . Lorry warned him that his boot was still on the hot embers of the flaming log after the log had broken under the weight of his foot . 
 I forgot it , he said . 
 Mr . Lorry looked at his face again . He noticed a wasted look that tarnished his naturally handsome face and was reminded of the expression on the faces of prisoners he had seen lately . 
 And your work here is coming to an end , sir ? said Carton , turning toward him . 
 Yes . As I was telling you last night when Lucie came in so unexpectedly , I have finally done all I can do here . I had hoped to leave the Manettes perfectly safe and then to leave Paris . I have my pass , which allows me to leave the city . I was ready to go .
