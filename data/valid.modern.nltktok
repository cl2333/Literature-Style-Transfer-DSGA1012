Moving his hand toward her little by little , he picked up her hair and looked at it .
 While doing this , his mind wandered again , and with another deep sigh , he went back to his shoemaking .
 He took her hair in his hand again and looked closely at it .
 It's the same .
 How can that be .
 When .
 How .
 As the intense expression reappeared on his forehead , he seemed to realize that the same expression was on her forehead too .
 He moved her into the light and looked at her .
 He formed these words silently with his lips many times before he could say them out loud .
 When he did finally speak them , he said them clearly , though slowly .
 How did this happen .
 WAS IT YOU .
 Listen .
 Monsieur Manette cried .
 Whose voice was that .
 No , no , no .
 You are too young .
 Too full of life .
 It can't be you .
 These are not the hands she knew , this is not the face she knew , this is not a voice she ever heard .
 No , no .
 She was , and he was , before all those slow-moving years I spent in the North Toweryears ago .
 What is your name , my gentle angel .
 Noticing that he had softened his tone of voice and behavior , his daughter fell down on her knees in front of him and placed her hands on his chest .
 His cold white hair mixed with her shining blond hair , and it was as if her hair warmed his like the light of freedom shining on him .
 If my voiceI don't know if it does , but if soif it reminds you of a voice that was once sweet music in your ears , cry for it .
 If touching my hair reminds you of the head that once rested on your chest when you were young and free , cry for it .
 If I hint that a home awaits you where I will take care of you , and it reminds you of the long-empty home you remembered from afar , cry for it .
 She hugged him around the neck and rocked him back and forth like a child .
 I tell you that your agony is over , and that I've come here to take you from it , and that we're going to England to be at peace .
 If that causes you to think of your wasted life , and how our home country , France , has mistreated you , cry for it .
 When I tell you my name , and about my father who is living , and about my mother who is dead , if you find out that I must beg my father's forgiveness because I didn't stay awake crying all night since my mother never told me of his imprisonment , cry for it .
 Cry for her , then , and for me .
 Gentlemen , thank God .
 I feel God's tears on my face and his sobbing in my heart .
 Thank God .
 More fit to travel , I think , than to stay in this city , where he has been treated so terribly .
 That's a business matter , said MrLorry , going back to his professional demeanor .
 And if business needs to be done , then I should be the one to do it .
 As it grew dark , the young woman lay her head down on the hard ground next to her father and watched him .
 It got darker and darker , and they both lay there quietly until a light shone through the cracks in the wall .
 In the way of a man used to obeying orders , he ate and drank what they gave him , and put on the cloak and other clothes they gave him to wear .
 He happily let his daughter link arms with him and held her hand with both of his .
 Do you remember this place , father .
 Do you remember coming up here .
 What did you say .
 But before she could repeat the question , he mumbled an answer .
 Do I remember .
 No , I don't remember .
 It was such a long time ago .
 Defarge climbed up on the coach and yelled , To the barrier .
 The driver cracked his whip , and the coach drove off under the dim swinging streetlamps .
 Don't you want to be brought back to life .
 And he got the same answer as before : 
 I don't know .
 The end of Book One .
 Tellson's Bank near Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place , even back in 1780 .
 It was very small , very dark , very ugly , and very uncomfortable .
 The partners who ran the bank were old-fashioned too .
 They were proud of its smallness , darkness , ugliness , and discomfort .
 They even boasted that their bank was all these things , and they believed that it if hadn't been so unpleasant , it wouldn't have been so well respected .
 The bankers liked to brag about this to their competitors .
 Tellson's Bank , they would say , didn't need elbow room or bright light or fancy decorations .
 Maybe Noakes and Co .
 or Snooks Brothers needed these things , but not Tellson's Bank .
 Any one these partners would have disinherited his own son for suggesting they refurbish Tellson's .
 In this way , Tellson's was like England , which did often punish its citizens for trying to improve laws and customs .
 But the fact that people had objected to these laws and customs for so long made them more respected .
 The old men who worked in the cramped quarters of Tellson's Bank took their work seriously .
 When the bank hired a young man , they hid him away until he was old .
 When they hired a young man at Tellson's London office , they kept him in a dark place and aged him , like a cheese , until he had the Tellson-flavor and mold grew on him .
 Only then was he allowed to be seen there , studying large books and strutting around with an air of self-importance .
 MrCruncher's apartment was not in a very good neighborhood .
 It had only two rooms , and only if a closet with a tiny window counted as one of them .
 He kept his apartment clean , though .
 As early as it was this windy March morning , his bedroom was already scrubbed clean , and the cups and saucers were set out for breakfast on a clean white tablecloth .
 MrCruncher was asleep under a patchwork quilt , like a Harlequin a clown from Italian comedy that wore a costume made up of multicolored patches Harlequin at home .
 He was sleeping heavily , but little by little he began to toss and turn in bed , with his spiky hair looking like it would tear his sheets to shreds .
 Finally he sat up and yelled out in frustration : 
 Bust me , if she isn't at it again .
 A neatly dressed woman quickly got up off her knees in the corner , with enough speed and fear to show that she was the woman he referred to .
 What .
 said MrCruncher , looking around the bed for his boot .
 You're at it again , are you .
 I was only praying .
 Praying .
 You're a nice woman .
 What are you doing throwing yourself down on your knees and praying against me .
 I'm not praying against you .
 I was praying for you .
 They come from the heart , Jerry .
 They're only worth what they mean to me .
 Muttering other phrases like Oh , yes .
 You're a religious woman , aren't you .
 You would never go against the best interests of your husband and child , would you .
 Not you .
 and making other such sarcastic comments , MrCruncher went about cleaning his boots and getting ready for work .
 Meanwhile , his son , whose hair was slightly less spiked than his father's and whose eyes were close together like his father's , watched his mother as he had been told .
 He kept surprising her by jumping out of his little bedroom where he was washing up and yelling , You were about to kneel down and pray , Mother .
 Hey .
 Father .
 and then , after yelling out this false warning , jumping back into the other room again with a grin .
 MrCruncher was still in a bad mood when he came to eat breakfast .
 He was particularly angry when MrsCruncher said grace .
 His wife explained to him that she was only asking for a blessing .
 Don't do it .
 said MrCruncher while he looked around , as if he expected his wife's prayers to make the loaf of bread on the table disappear .
 I'm not going to let myself be blessed out of house and home .
 I won't let you bless my food right off of my table .
 Keep quiet .
 Blurry-eyed and sullen , as if he had been up all night at a party that had ended badly , Jerry Cruncher ate his breakfast anxiously , growling over it like an animal .
 Around nine o'clock he calmed himself down and , making himself as respectable and professional looking as he could , went out to start his day .
 One of the regular messengers that worked in the bank poked his head out the door and said : 
 We need a porter .
 Hooray , Father .
 Here's an early job to start the day with .
 Having sent his father off , young Jerry sat on the stool , looked at the straw his father had been chewing on , and thought .
 You know the Old Bailey street in London where criminals were tried and imprisoned Old Bailey , don't you .
 one of the bank's oldest clerks asked Jerry .
 Ye-es , sir , answered Jerry , warily .
 I do know the Old Bailey .
 I thought so .
 And you know MrLorry .
 Good .
 Go find the door where they bring the witnesses in , and show the doorman this note for MrLorry .
 He will let you in .
 Into the courtroom , sir .
 MrCruncher narrowed his eyes , as if his eyes were asking each other , What do you think about this .
 Should I wait for him in court , sir .
 MrCruncher asked .
 Is that all , sir .
 That's all .
 He wants a messenger nearby .
 Your job is to let him know that you're there if he needs you .
 I guess they're trying people for forgery this morning .
 That's punishable by quartering dismembering a body into four parts quartering , said Jerry .
 How barbaric .
 It's the law , answered the old clerk , surprised at this comment .
 The law is the law .
 It's a harsh law .
 It's bad enough to kill him , but it's worse to torture him , sir .
 It's this damp weather , sir , that affects my health , said Jerry .
 My job often requires me to be out in wet weather .
 After a few moments , the doorman reluctantly opened the door a little way and allowed MrJerry Cruncher to squeeze into the courtroom .
 What case is this .
 Jerry whispered to the man next to him .
 Nothing yet .
 What case is next .
 The treason case .
 The one where they're going to quarter the man .
 If they decide he's guilty , you mean .
 asked Jerry .
 What's he got to do with this case .
 the man next to Jerry asked about MrLorry .
 I have no idea , said Jerry .
 What do you have to do with it , if I may ask .
 I don't know that either , said Jerry .
 A mirror hung over the prisoner's head to reflect light down onto him .
 Over the years this mirror had reflected the images of many poor and wicked prisoners who had eventually been put to death .
 If that mirror were ever able to send those reflections back out , the courtroom would have been filled with ghosts .
 The prisoner may have thought about how disgraceful it was to have this mirror there .
 He shifted and a shaft of light shining across his face made him look up .
 When he saw his reflection , he blushed and brushed the herbs off of the bar in front of him .
 As he made this gesture , he turned his face to his left .
 His eyes fell upon two people sitting near the judge's bench .
 His expression changed so much when he saw them that everyone who was watching turned to look .
 The two people were a young lady a little older than twenty years old and a gentleman who was apparently her father .
 He was a remarkable-looking man with white hair and an indescribable intensity in his face .
 This intense expression made him look like an old man .
 But when the expression left his face , as it had now while he talked to his daughter , he looked handsome and in the prime of his life .
 His daughter sat arm in arm with her father .
 Her fear and pity for the prisoner had made her pull close to him .
  But whether that's true or not , continued the nephew , looking at him suspiciously , I know that you would stop me any way you could , and use any means necessary .
 I remember that .
 Thank you , said the marquis , very sweetly .
 The tone of his voice stayed in the air like the tone of a musical instrument .
 I don't quite understand , answered the uncle , sipping his coffee .
 Can you explain .
 I believe that if you weren't out of favor with the court , and had not been for years , that a letter de cachet official documents that could be used to send someone to prison letter de cachet would have put me in prison indefinitely .
 I see that , luckily for me , you were received coldly two days ago at the monseigneur's reception , as usual , said the nephew .
 The marquis inhaled a pinch of snuff powdered tobacco that is sniffed up the nostrils snuff and shook his head .
 He was as elegantly unhappy as he could be with a country where he and his family still lived .
 We have used the power of our family's position , both in the old days and today , to such a degree , said Darnay unhappily , that I think our name is more hated that any name in France .
 Let's hope so , said the uncle .
 Hatred of the upper classes is the involuntary respect of the low classes .
 The only philosophy left is oppression .
 The dark respect of fear and slavery , my friend , will keep the peasants in line as long as this roof blocks out the sky , he said , looking up at the ceiling .
 That might not be as long as the marquis thought .
 If someone had shown him a picture of his chateau a few years later , and a picture of fifty others like it , he might not have been able to tell his house from the other burned , destroyed wrecks .
 As far as the roof , he might have discovered it blocking out the sky in a new awayshutting it out from the sight of the people who were shot by the bullets of a hundred thousand muskets .
 Meanwhile , said the marquis , I will preserve the honor and faith of our family , if you won't .
 But you must be tired .
 Should we end our meeting for the night .
 One more minute .
 We can continue for another hour if you want .
 Sir , said the nephew , we have done wrong , and we are reaping the benefits of these wrongdoings .
 We have done wrong .
 the marquis repeated with a questioning smile , delicately pointing at his nephew and then to himself .
 Death has separated us .
 said the marquis .
 My friend , I will die preserving the system under which I have lived .
 When he said it , he inhaled a pinch of snuff and put the snuffbox in his pocket .
 Better to be a rational creature , he added after ringing a small bell on the table , and accept your natural destiny .
 But I can see that you are lost , Monsieur Charles .
 Our family's property and all of this country are lost to me , said the nephew , sadly .
 I am giving them up .
 I have no plan to claim it yet .
 If I inherited it from you tomorrow .
 Which I hope , for my sake , is not likely , the marquis said .
 Or twenty years from now .
 You're too kind , said the marquis .
 Still , I prefer the possibility that I may live that long .
 I would give it up and go live a different kind of life somewhere else .
 It isn't much to give up .
 It only brings me misery .
 Hah .
 said the marquis , looking around his finely decorated room .
 Hah .
 said the marquis again , in a well-satisfied manner .
 In England , perhaps .
 Yes .
 I will not tarnish the family name there .
 The family name can't harm me elsewhere , since I do not use it in other countries .
 When the marquis had rung the bell , his valet lit the bedroom next door .
 Bright light now shone from it through the doorway .
 The marquis looked that way and listened until he had heard his valet walk away .
 I have told you already that I may be indebted to you , sir , for my success there .
 Otherwise , it has been a safe haven for me .
 Those bragging English say that it is a safe haven for many people .
 Do you know another Frenchman who has also found safety there .
 A doctor .
 With a daughter .
 Yes , said the marquis .
 You are tired .
 Good night .
 Yes , repeated the marquis .
 A doctor with a daughter .
 Yes .
 So begins the new way of thinking .
 You are tired .
 Good night .
 It would have been as useful to question the stone faces outside the chateau as it was to question the marquis's face .
 The nephew looked at him as he passed him on his way out the door , but he couldn't tell what he was thinking .
 I am cooler now and am ready to go to bed , said the marquis .
 For three hours , the stone faces of men and lions on the chateau stared out at the night .
 All of the land was dark , and the dust settled on the quiet roads .
 It was so dark that the little heaps of poor grass in the graveyard were indistinguishable from one another , and the figure on the crucifix might have come down , since it was practically invisible in the darkness .
 In the village , the tax collectors and the people who paid the taxes were fast asleep .
 They may have been dreaming of large feasts , as starving people usually do , or of resting and living easily , as overworked slaves and oxen do .
 The thin villagers slept soundly and , in their dreams , were fed well and were free .
 The Gorgon had looked at the building again that night and had turned one more face to stone .
 The building had been waiting for this particular stone face for two hundred years .
 Drive him quickly to his tomb .
 From Jacques .
 He hadn't expected things to be easy for him in London .
 If he had , he wouldn't have done so well .
 He had expected hard work , and he found it .
 He did the work and made the best of it , and by doing this , his success continued .
 Charles Darnay .
 I'm happy to see you .
 We have been expecting you for three or four days .
 MrStryver and Sydney Carton were both here yesterday and both said you should have visited by now .
 I am thankful to them for their interest in me , he answered , a little indifferent about them but very kind to the doctor .
 Miss Manette .
 said the doctor , controlling himself .
 Bring your chair over here and tell me what it is .
 MrDarnay brought over the chair as he had been told , but he had trouble saying what he wanted to say .
 The doctor reached out his hand to stop him .
 After he had kept it there a little while , he drew back his hand and asked : 
 Is Lucie what you want to talk about .
 She is .
 It is hard for me to talk about her at any time .
 It is especially hard for me to hear you talk about her in that tone , Charles Darnay .
 I believe you .
 I trust you .
 I believe you .
 He was so restrained and so unwilling to talk about the subject that Charles Darnay hesitated .
 Shall I continue , sir .
 The doctor was silent again .
 Don't speak of that , sir .
 Leave that alone .
 I beg you , don't bring that up .
 I'm sorry , said the doctor quietly after a while .
 I don't doubt that you love Lucie .
 You should be happy about that .
 Have you spoken to Lucie about this .
 Or written to her about it .
 Never .
 It would be rude to pretend not to know that you have kept yourself away from her out of respect for me .
 I thank you .
 I believe you , her father answered sadly .
 I have thought so before now .
 I believe you .
 He placed his hand on the doctor's hand as he spoke .
 No , dear Dr .
 Manette .
 Like you , I left France by choice .
 Like you , I left to get away from the distractions , oppressions , and unhappiness .
 Like you , I worked to get away and live by my own hard work .
 I left in search of a better future , and I only want to share in your happiness , to share your life and home , and devote myself to you until death .
 I don't want to take Lucie away from you as your child and friend , but to tie her closer to you , if such a thing is possible .
 He was still holding her father's hand .
 Her father responded by placing his hands on the arms of his chair .
 He looked up at him for the first time since their conversation had started , and it was obvious that he was struggling with something .
 He struggled with that dark look that would on occasion appear on his face .
 So far , none .
 Are you hoping to find this out from this conversation .
 Not at all .
 I might not have the courage to do it for weeks .
 I might have the courage to do it tomorrow , whether it's the right time to do it or not .
 Are you looking for advice from me .
 Are you hoping for a promise from me .
 Yes , I am .
 What is it .
 I know that without you I have no hope .
 I understand that , even if Miss Manette loved me alreadydon't assume that I am conceited enough to think that she doesI could ever be loved by her if you didn't approve .
 If that is so , do you see what else is involved in it .
 I'm sure of it .
 Charles Darnay , people who are close to each other still have secrets , just as people who are far apart .
 In the first case , those secrets are subtle , delicate , and hard to penetrate .
 In this way , Lucie is a mystery to me .
 I don't know how she feels about you .
 May I ask you , sir , if you think she is as he hesitated , the doctor finished the thought for him .
 Is being courted by another man .
 That is what I meant .
 Her father thought awhile before he answered : 
 You have seen MrCarton here .
 MrStryver is here too , sometimes .
 If she is being courted , it would have to be by one of these two men .
 Or both of them , said Darnay .
 I hadn't thought of that .
 I think it's more likely that it's neither of them .
 You want me to promise you something .
 Tell me what .
 I make the promise without any condition , said the doctor .
 I believe that what you said is true .
 I believe your intention is to make the bond between my daughter and me stronger , not weaker .
 If she ever tells me that she loves you , I will give her to you .
 If there wereCharles Darnay , if there were .
 MrDarnay had taken his hand gratefully .
 They were holding hands when the doctor said : 
 any ideas , reasons , fears , anything at all , new or old against the man that she was in love withany wrongdoing that he was not directly responsible forI would forget them all for the sake of her happiness .
 She is everything to me .
 More to me than suffering , more to me than injusticeÖWell .
 This is pointless talk .
 Hardly , I think .
 You'd probably have to be a lonely prisoner to understand the confusing differences between imagination and reality .
 Even though he was calm she was troubled as he tried to describe what it had been like for him .
 When I was in that more peaceful state of mind , I would imagine her coming to me in the moonlight and taking me out to show me the home where she lived with her husband .
 It was full of memories of her lost father .
 She had a picture of me in her room and prayed for me .
 She led a happy , productive life , but my sad story was still a part of it .
 I hope that I am that child , father .
 O my dear father , will you bless me as eagerly tomorrow .
 He hugged her , asked that Heaven watch over her , and thanked Heaven for giving her to him .
 Then they went into the house .
 No one was invited to the wedding except for MrLorry .
 The only bridesmaid was Miss Pross .
 The married couple wouldn't move to another house .
 They would take the upper rooms that had previously belonged to the lodger that they never saw , and they wanted nothing more .
 Doctor Manette was very happy at their little supper .
 There were only three of them at the table .
 Miss Pross was the third .
 He wished that Charles had been there , and he was nearly ready to object to the romantic little plan that kept Charles away .
 He toasted to him warmly .
 Everything was in order , though .
 It was quiet , and he was sleeping .
 His white hair looked pretty on his pillow , and his hands rested quietly on the blanket .
 She put her candle in the shadows far away and snuck up close to his bed .
 She kissed him , then leaned over and looked at him .
 Being a prisoner had left its marks on his handsome face .
 But he worked so hard to cover up the marks that he hid them even when he was asleep .
 A more remarkable face than his could not be found that night , as he quietly and determinedly struggled with his demons .
 She timidly put her hand on his chest and prayed that she could be as devoted to him as she hoped to be , and as his terrible past deserved .
 Then she removed her hand , kissed him again , and left .
 The sun rose and the shadows of the leaves of the plane tree moved on his face as softly as her lips had moved when she had prayed for him .
 And so , said MrLorry , who could not admire the bride enough and who had been moving around her to see every part of her simple , pretty wedding gown .
 This is why I brought you across the English Channel when you were young , my sweet Lucie .
 Lord bless me .
 I thought I was doing such a small thing .
 I didn't realize how important it would one day be for my friend MrCharles .
 You didn't mean for them to get married , commented the straightforward Miss Pross , and therefore how could you have known that this would happen .
 That's nonsense .
 Really .
 All right .
 But don't cry , said the gentle MrLorry .
 I'm not crying .
 You're crying , said Miss Pross .
 I , my dear Miss Pross .
 By now , MrLorry dared to be nice to her sometimes .
 You were crying just now .
 I saw you , and I'm not surprised about it .
 Your gift of plates and silverware is so impressive that it would make anybody cry .
 There's not a fork or a spoon in the whole collection that didn't make me cry until I couldn't see through my tears when the box arrived last night , said Miss Pross .
 Not at all .
 said Miss Pross .
 You think it's not possible that there could have been a MrsLorry .
 asked MrLorry .
 Pooh .
 answered Miss Pross .
 You were born to be a bachelor .
 And you were made to be a bachelor before you were put into your cradle , continued Miss Pross .
 The doctor offered his arm to Lucie , and he took her downstairs to the chariot that MrLorry had hired for the occasion .
 The rest of them followed in another carriage , and soon Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married privately in a nearby church .
 It was hard for them to say goodbye , though it didn't last long .
 Her father cheered for her , and gently pulling himself away from her embrace , finally said , Take her , Charles .
 She is yours .
 He had kept many of his feelings to himself , of course , and some strong emotions might have been expected to come out of him once the bride and groom had left .
 But what worried MrLorry was the frightened look on the doctor's face , and the fact that the doctor had absent-mindedly grabbed his head in his hands and wandered off into his room when they got upstairs .
 It reminded MrLorry of Defarge , the owner of the wine shop , and their night ride away from Paris under the stars .
 I think it would be best if we didn't talk to him right now or disturb him at all , he whispered to Miss Pross .
 I need to go to Tellson's Bank .
 I'll go there now and come back very soon , and then we will take him on a ride into the country and eat dinner there .
 Everything will be fine .
 It was easier for MrLorry to stop in at Tellson's than it was for him to leave Tellson's .
 He was delayed there for two hours .
 When he came back , he climbed the old staircase alone without bothering the servant .
 On his way into the doctor's rooms , he heard the sound of quiet knocking .
 Good God .
 he said , startled .
 What's that .
 MrLorry looked at what he was working ona shoe of the old size and shape .
 He picked up another shoe that was lying near him and asked what it was .
 It's a young lady's walking shoe , he mumbled without looking up at him .
 I should have finished it a long time ago .
 Leave it alone .
 The doctor looked up at him in his old mechanical and submissive manner without stopping his work .
 Do you know who I am , my dear friend .
 Think again .
 You are not a shoemaker .
 Think , my dear friend .
 MrLorry took these steps hoping that the doctor would get better again .
 If he recovered soon , MrLorry had a plan .
 There was someone who MrLorry thought would understand the doctor's case the best , and MrLorry would ask for this person's opinion on the matter .
 Hoping that the doctor would recover so that he could put this third plan into action , MrLorry decided to watch him closely but to do it as subtly as possible .
 He took time off from Tellson's Bank for the first time in his life and positioned himself in the window in the doctor's room .
 MrLorry soon discovered that it was useless to speak to him since it made him nervous .
 MrLorry gave up on that idea on the first day and decided instead to stay near him at all times and hope that his quiet presence would stop the doctor's delusions , or at least keep them from getting worse .
 MrLorry stayed at his seat near the window reading and writing and showing in as many pleasant ways as possible that it was a place where they were both free to do whatever they wanted .
 Will you go out .
 Out .
 Yes .
 Will you go for a walk with me .
 Why not .
 When it was night again , MrLorry asked him again as he had done before : 
 Dear Doctor , will you go out .
 Like before , the doctor repeated , Out .
 MrLorry was so tired out by anxiously watching the doctor that he fell asleep .
 On the tenth morning of the doctor's illness , MrLorry was startled by the sun shining into the room , since he had dozed off when it was dark night .
 Even when he was sure that he was actually awake , MrLorry wondered for a few moments whether the doctor's recent shoemaking had all been a dream .
 He could see his friend in front of him dressed and looking as usual , and reading as he normally did .
 Was there any sign that the change in the doctor that he had seen during the past few days had actually happened .
 Miss Pross was there within a few minutes , whispering quietly beside MrLorry .
 If he had any doubts left , the way she spoke about the situation would have decided the matter .
 By then , though , he was clearheaded and had no doubts .
 He decided that they should leave the doctor alone until the usual breakfast time , then they would meet the doctor as if nothing unusual had happened .
 If he seemed to be behaving as he typically did , MrLorry would then cautiously start looking for help from the man whose opinion he so anxiously wanted to hear .
 Miss Pross followed his advice and they worked out the plan carefully .
 MrLorry had plenty of time for his usual toilette the process of attending to your personal appearance toilette , and he arrived at breakfast in his usual white linen with his usual tight stockings .
 The doctor was called as usual , and he came to breakfast .
 If I understand correctly , said the doctor quietly , it's about some mental shock .
 Yes .
 Be specific , said the doctor .
 Give me all the details .
 MrLorry saw that the doctor understood him , and he went on .
 The doctor asked in a low voice , For how long .
 Nine days and nights .
 Yes , that's correct .
 Now , did you ever see him doing that activity when he used to do it before, asked the doctor , carefully , 
 Once .
 And when he relapsed , was he in most ways , or in all ways , as he was then .
 I think he was exactly the same .
 You spoke about his daughter .
 Does his daughter know about his relapse .
 No .
 She has not been told , and I hope she will never be told .
 Only myself and one other trustworthy person know about it .
 But I don't know how to begin in such a case , continued MrLorry .
 If your wisdom , knowledge , and experience could put me on the right track , I might be able to do a lot .
 But uninformed and without help , I can't do much of anything .
 Please talk with me about it .
 Please help me understand it better and teach me how to be of more help .
 I think it's likely that the patient may have expected the relapse you have described , said the doctor , requiring an effort to break the silence .
 Was he afraid it might happen again .
 MrLorry asked .
 Very much .
 He said it with an involuntary shudder .
 You have no idea how troublesome such a fear is to a person , and how difficulthow almost impossibleit is for him to make himself talk about the subject that haunts him .
 Would it help him , asked MrLorry , if he could tell someone else that secret when it is bothering him .
 I think so .
 But it is , as I have told you , almost impossible .
 I even think that , in some cases , it is impossible .
 Would he remember what happened during the relapse .
 asked MrLorry hesitantly .
 The doctor looked around the room sadly , shook his head , and answered quietly , Not at all .
 Now , said the doctor , recovering himself , I have great hope .
 It gives me hope that he recovered from his relapse so soon .
 The fact that he gave in to the pressure of whatever was haunting him and recovered after the spell had passed gives me hope that the worst is over .
 Well , well .
 That makes me feel better .
 I am thankful .
 said MrLorry .
 I am also thankful .
 repeated the doctor , bowing his head with respect .
 There are two other things that I would like help with , said MrLorry .
 May I go on .
 You couldn't do your friend a better favor than to continue .
 The doctor gave him his hand .
 I don't think so .
 It may just be the way he is .
 His mind might always need to be occupied .
 That might partly be in his nature and partly a result of the sickness .
 The less his mind is occupied with healthy things , the more it would be in danger of focusing on unhealthy things .
 He may have noticed this about himself .
 You're sure that he is not under too much stress .
 I think I am quite sure of it .
 My dear Manette , if he were overworked now .
 The occupation the patient took up during this temporary relapse said MrLorry , clearing is throat , we will call it blacksmith's work .
Influence .
 Something about influence .
 Surely his influence will get Charles released .
 said Madame Defarge .
 Let it .
 Madame Defarge looked as coldly as ever at the pleading woman , and turning to her friend The Vengeance , said : 
 We've seen nothing else , answered The Vengeance .
 We have endured this for a long time , said Madame Defarge , looking at Lucie again .
 Judge you .
 Is it likely that the suffering of one wife and mother would matter much to us now .
 Madame Defarge went back to her knitting and left .
 The Vengeance followed .
 Monsieur Defarge went out last and closed the door .
 I am not ungrateful , I hope , but that terrible woman has thrown a dark shadow on my hopes .
 But the way the Defarges were acting had thrown a shadow on him too , and what they had said secretly bothered him very much .
 As MrLorry listened , and as he watched the face of his friend who was now sixty-two years old , he started to worry that these terrible experiences might cause a relapse of his old dangerous condition .
 It cut off so many heads that it was stained red along with the ground underneath it .
 It was taken apart and put together again when it was needed , like a puzzle for a terrible young child .
 It silenced those who spoke well , knocked down those who were powerful , and eliminated those who were beautiful and good .
 It had cut off the heads of twenty-two respectable peopletwenty-one of them were alive and one was already deadwithin twenty-two minutes on one morning .
 The executioner who operated it had been nicknamed Samson after the strong man of the Old Testament .
 But with the guillotine , he was stronger than Samson , and more blind , and he tore down the gates of God's own temple every day .
 Charles had been in prison for one year and three months .
 During that time , Lucie never knew from one hour to the next if the guillotine would cut off his head the next day .
 Every day , carts filled with condemned prisoners rumbled through the streets .
 Beautiful girls .
 attractive women with brown , black , or gray hair .
 young men and women .
 sturdy old men .
 nobles and peasants all went to bleed at the guillotine .
 Every day they were brought from the dark cellars of the prisons to the light of the outdoors and brought through the streets to satisfy the guillotine's thirst .
 Of the Revolution's slogan , Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death , the last one , death , was the easiest to impart .
 O guillotine .
 If the suddenness of Lucie's misfortune , and the chaos of the time , had stunned her into waiting for Charles's release in idle despair , she would have been like many others in her situation .
 But since she had first found her father in the attic in Saint Antoine , she had always been committed to her responsibilities .
 She was even more committed now , as all who are quietly loyal and good always are .
 They had only been living this new life of theirs for a few weeks when , upon coming home one night , her father said to her : 
 Oh , show me the place , Father , and I will go there every day .
 The place where she would stand was a dark and dirty corner of a small , winding street .
 The small hut of a wood sawyer a person who saws wood for a living wood sawyer , who sawed logs into pieces for firewood , was the only house at that end of the street .
 The rest of the street was enclosed by walls .
 On the third day Lucie was there , the wood sawyer noticed her .
 Good day , citizeness .
 Good day , citizen .
 I see you're walking here again , citizeness .
 You see that I am , citizen .
 The next day he was waiting for her and approached her as soon as she appeared .
 You're walking here again , citizeness .
 This is your mother , isn't it , my little citizeness .
 Should I say yes , Mamma .
 little Lucie whispered to her mother , pulling close to her .
 Part of the piece of the wood fell off as he spoke , and he threw it into a basket .
 She continued to do this until December .
 Meanwhile , her father moved among all the terrible events happening with a cool head .
 One afternoon , when it was snowing lightly , Lucie arrived at her usual corner .
 It was a day when people were celebrating and there was a festival .
 As she walked through the streets she noticed that the houses were decorated with little pikes that had little red caps stuck on them .
 They were also decorated with three-colored ribbons , and had the standard slogan of the Republic many in three-colored letters , One and Indivisible .
 Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death .
 The wood sawyer's gloomy little shop was so small that this slogan hardly fit on it .
 He had gotten somebody to write it for him who had barely been able to squeeze in the word death .
 On his rooftop he had placed a cap on a pike , as all good citizens were expected to do , and he had placed his saw in one window with the words Little Saint Guillotine written on it , for now people referred to the guillotine as Saint Guillotine .
 His shop was closed and he wasn't there , and Lucie was relieved to be left alone .
 I'll do it , Father , and I send him my soul with it .
 You can't see him , my poor dear .
 Give me your arm , my love .
 Leave here looking cheerful and brave for your husband's sake .
 That is the best thing you can do .
 They left the spot .
 All of this won't be for nothing .
 Charles is going before the court tomorrow .
 I must see MrLorry , repeated the doctor , turning the other way .
 MrLorry was still at the bank .
 He had never left it .
 He and his records were in frequent demand regarding property that had been taken away from its owners and given to the state .
 He saved what he could for the owners .
 There was no better man alive to be trusted to take care of Tellson's property , and to keep quiet .
 The sky turned a murky red and yellow , and a mist rose up from the Seine River .
 Night was coming , and it was almost dark when they arrived at Tellson's Bank .
 The elegant former home of the monseigneur was wrecked and empty .
 Above a pile of dust and ashes in the courtyard was a sign that said National Property .
 Republic One and Indivisible .
 Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death .
 Charles Evremonde , also known as Darnay .
 This is how the evening paper began at La Force Prison .
 When someone's name was called , the person would step forward into an area reserved for him .
 Charles Evremonde , also known as Darnay , already knew this .
 He had seen hundred of people go to their deaths this way .
 Charles Evremonde , also known as Darnay , was finally brought before the court .
 Cut off his head .
 yelled the crowd .
 He is an enemy of the Republic .
 The president rang his bell to silence the crowd and asked the prisoner if it was true that he had lived in England for many years .
 Darnay said it was true .
 Darnay said he was not an emigrant , he hoped , as the law defines it .
 The president asked him what proof he had of this .
 Darnay said it was true , but he hadn't married an English woman .
 The president asked if the woman was French .
 The president asked her name and who her family was .
 The crowd was pleased by this answer , and they cheered Dr .
 Manette , who was well known as a good doctor .
 The crowd was so fickle that several ferocious individuals , who had been glaring at Darnay a moment before as if they wanted to drag him out into the street and kill him , were now crying for him .
 The president asked why he had returned to France when he did , and not sooner .
 Darnay said he did not return sooner simply because he had no way of making a living in France except by the ways he had given up .
 In England he made a living by teaching French and French literature .
 He returned when he did after receiving an urgent letter from a French citizen , who told Darnay that his absence had put the citizen's life in danger .
 He came back to save a French citizen's life and to face the truth , whatever personal danger it placed him in .
 He asked if that were a crime in the eyes of the Republic .
 The crowd yelled enthusiastically , No .
 The president rang his bell to quiet them .
 It didn't quiet them , though , for they continued to yell No .
 until they quieted down on their own .
 The president asked the name of that citizen .
 Darnay explained that the citizen was his first witness .
 He also referred to the citizen's letter and explained that the letter had been taken from him at the barrier into Paris , but that he believed it was likely there in the papers that the president had in front of him .
 Oh , dearest Charles , let me thank God for this on my knees the way I have been praying to Him .
 They all bowed their heads in prayer .
 When she was in Darnay's arms again , he said to her : 
 And now speak to your father , my dear .
 No other man in all of France could have done what he has done for me .
 For several months now , Miss Pross and MrCruncher had been in charge of getting supplies .
 Miss Pross would carry the money and Jerry would carry the basket .
 They would go out shopping every afternoon around the time when the streetlamps were lit , and they would buy and bring home whatever they needed .
 Miss Pross could have known as much French as English by now if she'd wanted , having lived with a French family for a long time , but she had no desire to .
 Therefore , she knew no more of that French nonsense as she liked calling it than Jerry did .
 So her way of shopping was to just say the name of what she wanted without any other conversation .
 If it didn't happen to be the right word , she would look around for the thing she wanted , grab it , and hold onto it until she had paid for it .
 She always bargained the price down by holding up one finger less than the number the shopkeeper held up .
 Jerry told Miss Pross in his hoarse voice that he was ready .
 He had worn all of the rust off of his fingers a long time ago , but he still had spiked hair .
 It will all be the same to you , miss , if they toast to your health or to the Old One's , answered Jerry .
 Who's he .
 asked Miss Pross .
 MrCruncher , with some hesitancy , explained that he meant the devil .
 Quiet .
 Please , please be careful what you say .
 cried Lucie .
 I think you can take that liberty , the doctor answered , smiling .
 For goodness sake , don't talk about liberty .
 We have quite enough of that , said Miss Pross .
 Quiet .
 Again .
 Lucie protested .
 MrCruncher , being excessively patriotic , repeated the words in his hoarse voice as if he were at church .
 Not yet , I'm afraid .
 It would still be dangerous for Charles .
 What's that .
 she yelled out suddenly .
 Lucie , the staircase is as quiet as death .
 As he said the last word , someone knocked on the door .
 Oh , Father , Father .
 Who can this be .
 Hide Charles .
 Save him .
 He picked up the lamp , walked through the two outer rooms , and opened the door .
 He heard the sound of footsteps hurrying over the floor , and four rough men in red caps entered the room with sabers and pistols .
 We're looking for the Citizen Evremonde , also known as Darnay , said the first man .
 I'm looking for him .
 We're all looking for him .
 I know you , Evremonde .
 I saw you brought before the tribunal today .
 You are again a prisoner of the Republic .
 The four men surrounded Charles , who stood where he was with Lucie and their daughter clinging to him .
 Tell me why I am a prisoner again .
 It's enough for you to know that you are to be taken straight back to the Conciergerie .
 They will tell you why tomorrow when you are summoned before the tribunal again .
 You say you know Charles Darnay .
 Do you know me .
 Yes , I know you , Citizen Doctor .
 We all know you , Citizen Doctor , said the other three men .
 Will you answer Charles's questions for me then .
 Why is this happening .
 The second man nodded his head and added : 
  Should I date it .
 No .
 If you remember what we said to each other long ago , you will understand this when you read it , ' Carton dictated .
 ëYou do remember it , I know .
 It is not in your nature to forget it .
 Have you written ëforget it' yet .
 asked Carton .
 I have .
 Is that a weapon in your hand .
 No .
 I am unarmed .
 What's in your hand .
 Darnay dropped the pen onto the table and looked around him , dazed .
 What is that vapor .
 he asked .
 Vapor .
 Did I inhale something .
 I'm not aware of anything .
 There can't be anything here .
 Pick up the pen and finish .
 Hurry , hurry .
 Hurry , hurry .
 Darnay bent over the paper again .
 Carton didn't move his hand back to his breast pocket anymore .
 Darnay jumped up with an accusing look , but Carton was holding his hand firmly up to his nostrils .
 Carton's left arm caught him around the waist , and for a few seconds Darnay tried to fight with Carton , who had come to lay down his life for him .
 But within a minute or so , Darnay was stretched out on the ground , unconscious .
 MrCarton , answered Barsad , snapping his fingers timidly , this business doesn't put me in danger if you stay true to your side of the deal .
 Don't be afraid of me .
 I will be true until my death .
 You have to be , MrCarton , if fifty-two people are to die .
 If you go through with it dressed like that , I shall have nothing to fear .
 You .
 asked Barsad , nervously .
 Him , man , whom I have changed places with .
 Do you go out at the same gate you brought me in through .
 Of course .
 Tell them I was weak and faint when you brought me in and I am fainter now that you are taking me out .
 Tell them my final conversation with Darnay was too much for me .
 Such a thing has happened here oftentoo often .
 Your life is in your own hands .
 Quick .
 Call for help .
 You swear not to betray me .
 said Barsad , trembling as he paused for a moment .
 What happened .
 asked one of them , looking at the man who had fallen down .
 He's troubled to find out that his friend is being sent to the guillotine .
 A good patriot could hardly have been more upset if this nobleman had been released .
 We're running out of time , Evremonde , Barsad said to Carton in a warning voice .
 I know , answered Carton .
 Please take care of my friend and leave me alone .
 Come on , boys , said Barsad .
 Lift him up and come this way .
 Then he heard sounds , but he wasn't afraid of them because he knew what they meant .
 Several doors opened one after another , and finally his own door opened .
 A jailer with a list in his hand looked inside .
 All he said was , Follow me , Evremonde .
 Carton followed him into a large , dark room that was far away .
 It was a dark winter day .
 The shadows inside and outside made it difficult to see the other people who were brought there to have their arms tied .
 Some were standing up and some were seated .
 A few of them were crying and some were moving around nervously .
 But most of them were silent and still , staring at the ground .
 He murmured , That's right .
 I forgetwhat were you accused of .
 Plots .
 Though Heaven knows that I am innocent .
 Is it likely .
 Who would think of plotting with a poor , little weak creature like me .
 She smiled sadly when she said it , and he was so touched that he started to tear up .
 He was moved by this poor girl , and she was the last thing on earth that would move him .
 I heard you were released , Citizen Evremonde .
 I hoped it was true .
 It was .
 But I was arrested again and condemned to die .
 If I can ride in the same cart as you , Citizen Evremonde , will you let me hold your hand .
 I'm not afraid , but I am little and weak and it will give me more courage .
 As the girl looked up into his face , he saw that she suddenly doubted whether he was actually who he said .
 She looked astonished , and he kissed her young fingers , which were worn from years of poverty .
 Are you dying for him .
 she whispered .
 Oh , will you let me hold your hand , brave stranger .
 Hush .
 Yes , my dear .
 To the very end .
 The people inside the coach handed the guard the papers and he read them .
 Alexandre Manette .
 Doctor .
 French .
 Which one is he .
 They pointed out the confused old man .
 He was mumbling incoherently .
 Apparently the citizen doctor is not in his right mind .
 The Revolution fever was too much for him .
 It was far too much for him .
 They pointed her out .
 It must be .
 This is she .
 Kiss me , daughter of Evremonde , the guard said to her .
 Now you have kissed a good Republican .
 That's something new to your family .
 Remember it .
 Sydney Carton .
 Lawyer .
 English , the guard read .
 Which one is he .
 He was lying in a corner of the carriage .
 They pointed him out too .
 Apparently the English lawyer has fainted .
 We hope he will recover from the fresh air .
 He isn't well and is upset to be separated from a friend who has angered the Republic .
 Is that all .
 That's no big deal .
 Many have angered the Republic and must look out of the little windows of the prisons .
 Jarvis Lorry .
 Banker .
 English , read the guard .
 Which one is he .
 It was Jarvis Lorry who had answered all the previous questions .
 It was Jarvis Lorry who got out and stood with his hand on the coach door , answering the group of officials .
 The guards slowly walked around the carriage and climbed up on top to look at what little luggage there was on the roof .
 The country people were hanging around , pressing nearer to the coach doors and staring into it greedily .
 A small child in its mother's arms was reaching out so that it could touch the wife of an aristocrat who had been killed by the guillotine .
 We can leave , citizen .
 You can leave .
 Move forward , postilions a person riding one of the horses in a team drawing a carriage postilions .
 Have a good journey .
 Aren't we going too slowly .
 Can't we make them go faster .
 asked Lucie , clinging to her father .
 It would look like we were running away if we did .
 We can't make them go too fast .
 It would look suspicious .
 Look back and see if they are chasing us .
 The road is empty , my dear .
 So far they are not chasing us .
 Ho .
 You inside the carriage .
 Speak .
 What is it .
 asked MrLorry , looking out the window .
 How many did they say .
 I don't understand you .
 At the last post .
 How many did they say were sent to the guillotine today .
 Fifty-two .
 That's what I said .
 A good number .
 My fellow citizen here said it was forty-two .
 There are ten more people than that who deserve to have their heads cut off today .
 The guillotine works well .
 I love it .
 Then he yelled at the horses , Forward .
 Whoop .
 But Monsieur Defarge is a good Republican without a doubt , isn't he .
 asked Jacques Three .
 There isn't a better Republican in France , the talkative Vengeance said in her shrill voice .
 Madame Defarge looked down and thought a little .
 The child also has blond hair and blue eyes , said Jacques Three , thoughtfully enjoying his words .
 We rarely have a child sent to the guillotine .
 It's a pretty sight .
 In a word , said Madame Defarge , getting back onto the subject , I can't trust my husband about this .
 Since last night I've felt that I can't trust him with the details of my plans .
 I also feel that if I delay he could warn them , and then they might escape .
 That must never happen , said Jacques Three hoarsely .
 No one must escape .
 We don't have enough people dying as it is .
 We should have a hundred and twenty people sent to the guillotine every day .
 The wood sawyer , who was deathly afraid of Madame Defarge , came forward clutching his red cap .
 About those signals that she made to the prisoners , little citizen , said Madame Defarge sternly .
 Are you ready to swear to them today .
 He made all sorts of gestures as he spoke , as if he were imitating a few of the different signals that he had never actually seen Lucie make .
