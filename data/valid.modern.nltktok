Many things .
 Such as shrouds a cloth that a corpse is wrapped in before burial shrouds , answered Madame Defarge calmly .
 The repairer of roads was now regaining his senses .
 He worried that he had done something wrong by behaving the way he had , but he had not .
 You are the man we want , said Defarge in his ear .
 You make these fools think that this will all go on forever .
 That makes them more disrespectful and will end this all that much sooner .
 Hey .
 yelled the repairer of roads , thinking about what he said .
 That's true .
 Madame Defarge looked at him arrogantly and nodded in agreement .
 Honestly , madame , I think so .
 At least for the moment .
 Honestly , madame , yes .
 It's true , madame .
 You've seen both dolls and birds today , said Madame Defarge with a wave of her hand toward where the king and queen and their attendants had been seen .
 Now go home .
 The chateau and the hut , the stone face and the hanged man , the red stain on the stone floor and the pure water in the village well , thousands of acres of land , a whole province of France , even all of France , and everything under the night skyall are just a line as thin as a hair on the timeline of man .
 Our whole world and all the events that take place on it , both big and little , pass in the twinkling of a star .
 And just as human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyze what it's made of , so more intelligent beings might be able to analyze all of the thoughts , deeds , vices , and virtues of every human being on earth .
 Say then , my friend .
 What did Jacques the policeman tell you .
 He told me all he knows , which isn't much tonight .
 There's been another spy hired for our neighborhood .
 There might be many more , for all he knows , but he knows of one for sure .
 Oh , well .
 said Madame Defarge , raising her eyebrows in a calm , businesslike manner .
 We'll need to put him on the list .
 What do they call him .
 He's English .
 Even better .
 What's his name .
 Barsad , said Defarge , using the French pronunciation .
 But he had been so careful to get the name right that he said it perfectly .
 Barsad , repeated Madame Defarge .
 Good .
 What's his first name .
 John .
 My goodness .
 It's a portrait .
 said Madame Defarge , laughing .
 I'll put him on the list tomorrow .
 It was a hot night , and the shop was in a filthy area of town and smelled bad .
 Monsieur Defarge's sense of smell wasn't delicate at all , but the wine stock seemed to smell much stronger than it had ever tasted , as did the rum , brandy , and anise a licorice-flavored liqueur anise .
 He waved the combination of scents away as he finished his pipe and put it down .
 You're tired , said Madame Defarge , looking up as she tied the coins into the handkerchief .
 They are only the usual smells .
 I'm a little tired , her husband admitted .
 You're a little depressed too , said Madame Defarge , who was never so focused on the shop's business that she didn't notice how her husband was doing .
 Oh , men , men .
 But , my dear .
 Defarge began .
 But , my dear .
 ' Madame Defarge repeated , nodding at him .
 But , my dear .
 You are depressed tonight , my dear .
 It doesn't take a long time for a man to be struck by lightning , said Defarge .
 How long , asked Madame Defarge calmly , does it take to make and store the lightning .
 Tell me .
 Defarge looked up thoughtfully , as if there were some sense in what she had said .
 It doesn't take a long time , said Madame Defarge , for an earthquake to destroy a town .
 Well .
 Tell me , how long does it take to create an earthquake .
 A long time , I suppose , said Defarge .
 She tied a coin into a knot with a fierce look in her eyes , as if she were strangling an enemy .
 Well .
 said Defarge , with a shrug .
 We shall not see victory .
 We will have helped to cause it , answered Madame Defarge , waiving her hand for emphasis .
 Nothing that we do is wasted .
 I believe with all of my soul that we shall see victory .
 But even if we don't , even if I knew that we would not , show me the neck of an aristocrat who is a tyrant and I would .
 Then Madame Defarge , clenching her teeth , violently tied another knot in the handkerchief .
 Yes .
 But it is your weakness that sometimes you need to see your victim and an opportunity in front of you to keep you going .
 You need to stay focused without that .
 When the time comes , let yourself go like a tiger and a devil .
 But until then , keep yourself in checkalways ready to pounce , but hidden where no one can see .
 A person coming in through the door of the wine shop cast his shadow on Madame Defarge , and Madame Defarge felt it was someone she didn't know .
 She put down her knitting and started to pin her rose to her hat before she looked at the stranger .
 It was strange .
 The moment Madame Defarge picked up the rose , all of the customers stopped talking and gradually left the wine shop .
 Good day , madame , said the newcomer .
 Good day , monsieur , answered Madame Defarge .
 She said the last words out loud , and to herself she added , Ha .
 Good day to you , about forty years old , about five feet nine inches tall with black hair , a handsome appearance , a dark complexion , dark eyes , and long , thin , yellow face with a hooked nose that leans toward the left cheek , giving you a mean look .
 Good day .
 Would you be kind enough to give me a little glass of aged cognac and a drink of cool , fresh water , madame .
 Madame Defarge politely gave him what he asked .
 This cognac is marvelous , madame .
 It was the first time anyone had complimented her cognac , and she knew enough about where it came from to know it was not good cognac .
 She said , however , that the cognac was flattered by his comment and she resumed her knitting .
 The visitor watched her fingers for a few moments and then looked around the wine shop .
 You're very good at knitting , madame .
 I am used to it .
 It's a very pretty pattern too .
 You think so .
 she said , smiling at him .
 Definitely .
 Can I ask what it's for .
 It's just a hobby , said Madame Defarge , still smiling at him while her fingers worked quickly .
 It's not for a particular use .
 It was amazing that the people of Saint Antoine seemed to hate the rose on Madame Defarge's headband .
 Two men had come into the wine shop separately and had been about to order a drink .
 When they saw the rose they stuttered and pretended they were looking for a friend who wasn't there , then they left .
 Of all the people who had been there when the visitor had come in , not one of them was still there .
 They had all gone .
 The spy had been watching but hadn't noticed the sign .
 They had all wandered off in a poor , casual way that looked perfectly normal and innocent .
 John , Madame Defarge thought as she knit the name into her list and kept looking at the stranger .
 If you stay long enough I will have knit Ã«Barsad' before you've left .
 Do you have a husband , madame .
 I do .
 Children .
 No children .
 Business seems bad .
 Business is very bad .
 All the people are poor .
 Ah , those poor , unlucky people .
 So oppressed too , like you say .
 Gaspard's execution is a shame , madame .
 Ah .
 Poor Gaspard .
 he sighed sympathetically .
 I believe , whispered the spy , looking conspiratorial , I believe there is a lot of sympathy and anger for the poor man in this neighborhood , isn't there .
 Between you and me .
 Is there .
 asked Madame Defarge innocently .
 Isn't there .
 Here is my husband .
 said Madame Defarge .
 As Monsieur Defarge came through the door of the wine shop , the spy saluted him by touching his hat and said with a smile , Good day , Jacques .
 Defarge stopped walking and stared at him .
 Good day , Jacques .
 repeated the spy .
 He didn't speak quite as confidently or smile quite as easily this time .
 You are confused , monsieur , answered the owner of the wine shop .
 You must have confused me for someone else .
 That's not my name .
 I am Ernest Defarge .
 Good day .
 answered Defarge , coldly .
 No one has told me that , said Defarge , shaking his head .
 I know nothing about it .
 Not at all , but I hope to get to know it better .
 I am extremely interested in the unfortunate people who live here .
 Hah .
 Defarge muttered .
 The joy of talking with you , Monsieur Defarge , reminds me , continued the spy , that I am lucky enough to know some things about you .
 Really .
 said Defarge , indifferently .
 That's true , for sure , said Defarge .
 His wife let him know by brushing her elbow against him as she knitted and sang that he should answer , but only as briefly as possible .
 That's true , repeated Defarge .
 Yes .
 said Defarge .
 You don't hear from them much now .
 asked the spy .
 No , said Defarge .
 Actually , Madame Defarge added , looking up from her knitting and her little song , we never hear from them .
 We got the news that they arrived safely in England , and perhaps another letter or two from them , maybe two .
 But since then , they have gone their way , we have gone ours , and we haven't kept in touch .
 Good , madame , answered the spy .
 She is going to be married .
 Going to be .
 repeated Madame Defarge .
 She was attractive enough to have gotten married a long time ago .
 You English are cold people , it seems to me .
 Oh .
 You can tell that I am English .
 You have an English accent , answered Madame Defarge .
 Therefore I assume that you are an Englishman .
 Since he's the one who said it , it's probably false , answered Madame Defarge , raising her eyebrows a little .
 But it might be true .
 If it is Defarge started to say , then stopped .
 If it is .
 repeated his wife .
 And if the revolution comes while we are still alive , I hope for her sake that destiny keeps her husband out of France .
 Her husband's destiny , said Madame Defarge , as calmly as usual , will take him where he is meant to go and to the end that he is meant for .
 That's all I know .
 Stranger things than this will happen when the revolution does come , answered Madame Defarge .
 I have them both here on my list , for sure .
 And they are both here for what they have done .
 That is enough .
 She rolled up her knitting when she said this , then took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wrapped around her head .
 Either the people of Saint Antoine knew instinctively that she had taken out the rose or the people of Saint Antoine were watching for it to be removed .
 Either way , people soon came wandering into the wine shop and things in the wine shop went back to normal .
 But as they worked their fingers , their eyes and minds worked hard .
 And as Madame Defarge moved from group to group , her fingers , eyes , and thoughts got quicker and angrier with every group of women she stopped by to visit with .
 There was never a more glorious sunset on the quiet street corner in Soho than one night when Doctor Manette and Lucie sat under the plane tree together .
 The moon never rose with a gentler glow over London than on that night when it rose as they were still sitting under the tree , and shined through its leaves onto their faces .
 Lucie was to be married the next day .
 She had saved this last night for her father , and they sat alone together under the plane tree .
 Are you happy , father .
 Very happy , my child .
 They hadn't said much , though they had been there a long time .
 When it was still light enough to work and read , she hadn't done her work or read to him as she usually did .
 Many times she had done both as she sat beside him under the tree .
 But tonight was different than all others , and nothing could change that .
 I'm very happy tonight , too , father .
 The love that Heaven has blessed me withmy love for Charles , and Charles's love for me has made me very happy .
 But , if my life wasn't still dedicated to you , or if my marriage pulled us apart , even by the distance of only a few streets , I would be more unhappy and disappointed in myself than I could tell you .
 Even as it is .
 Her voice quivered .
 She embraced him in the moonlight and buried her face in his chest .
 The moonlight is always sad , as is sunlight and human life itself , when it is coming or going .
 Dear father .
 Can you tell me one last time that you are absolutely sure that no new feelings of mine , or responsibilities , will ever come between us .
 I am sure of it , but are you .
 Do you feel sure about it in your heart .
 I hope that is true , father .
 Believe it , my love .
 It is true .
 Think of how natural and easy it is , my dear , for it to be that way .
 You , loyal and young , cannot understand how worried I have been that your life would be wasted .
 She raised her hand to his lips to stop him from speaking , but he took hold of it and repeated the word .
 If I had never met Charles , father , I would have been happy being with you .
 He smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy without Charles once she had seen him .
 He answered : 
 It was the first time since the trial that she had ever heard him mention his unhappy past .
 His words made her feel strange in a way she had never felt before .
 She remembered the feeling for a long time afterwards .
 See .
 said Doctor Manette , raising his hand toward the moon .
 I have looked at the moon from my prison window when it was painful to look at .
 I have looked at it when it was such torture to think of the moon shining on all that I had lost that I beat my head against my cell walls .
 I have looked at the moon when I was so tired and depressed that I thought about nothing accept how many lines I could draw up and down and across it .
 He added to himself as he looked at the moon , it was twenty either direction , I remember , and it was difficult to squeeze the twentieth line in .
 The strange feeling she had got stronger as he talked about that time .
 But he wasn't telling her in order to shock her .
 He only seemed to be comparing how happy he was now to the difficult times he had faced before .
 She pulled closer to him and kissed him on the cheek and hand .
 Father .
 Even to hear that you thought such things about a daughter who never existed hurts me as if I had been the daughter you speak of .
 You , Lucie .
 It is because of the comfort and strength that you have brought me that we can talk about these memories now under the moonlight on our last night together .
 What did I say just now .
 So .
 But on other moonlit nights , when I have been in a different mood , one like a sad sense of peace , I have imagined that she came to visit me in my cell and took me out of the prison and to freedom .
 I often imagined her standing in the moonlight as I see you doing now .
 Except that I never got to hold her in my arms .
 The image was between my little grated window and the door .
 But you understand that that is not the child I am talking about .
 No .
 That was another thing .
 It stood before my eyes but it never moved .
 The phantom that I was dreaming about was another real child .
 I don't know anything about what she looked like other than that she looked like her mother .
 The other child looked like her too like you dobut not the same .
 Do you understand what I'm saying , Lucie .
 Hardly , I think .
 You'd probably have to be a lonely prisoner to understand the confusing differences between imagination and reality .
 Even though he was calm she was troubled as he tried to describe what it had been like for him .
 When I was in that more peaceful state of mind , I would imagine her coming to me in the moonlight and taking me out to show me the home where she lived with her husband .
 It was full of memories of her lost father .
 She had a picture of me in her room and prayed for me .
 She led a happy , productive life , but my sad story was still a part of it .
 I hope that I am that child , father .
 O my dear father , will you bless me as eagerly tomorrow .
 He hugged her , asked that Heaven watch over her , and thanked Heaven for giving her to him .
 Then they went into the house .
 No one was invited to the wedding except for MrLorry .
 The only bridesmaid was Miss Pross .
 The married couple wouldn't move to another house .
 They would take the upper rooms that had previously belonged to the lodger that they never saw , and they wanted nothing more .
 Doctor Manette was very happy at their little supper .
 There were only three of them at the table .
 Miss Pross was the third .
 He wished that Charles had been there , and he was nearly ready to object to the romantic little plan that kept Charles away .
 He toasted to him warmly .
 Everything was in order , though .
 It was quiet , and he was sleeping .
 His white hair looked pretty on his pillow , and his hands rested quietly on the blanket .
 She put her candle in the shadows far away and snuck up close to his bed .
 She kissed him , then leaned over and looked at him .
 Being a prisoner had left its marks on his handsome face .
 But he worked so hard to cover up the marks that he hid them even when he was asleep .
 A more remarkable face than his could not be found that night , as he quietly and determinedly struggled with his demons .
 She timidly put her hand on his chest and prayed that she could be as devoted to him as she hoped to be , and as his terrible past deserved .
 Then she removed her hand , kissed him again , and left .
 The sun rose and the shadows of the leaves of the plane tree moved on his face as softly as her lips had moved when she had prayed for him .
 And so , said MrLorry , who could not admire the bride enough and who had been moving around her to see every part of her simple , pretty wedding gown .
 This is why I brought you across the English Channel when you were young , my sweet Lucie .
 Lord bless me .
 I thought I was doing such a small thing .
 I didn't realize how important it would one day be for my friend MrCharles .
 You didn't mean for them to get married , commented the straightforward Miss Pross , and therefore how could you have known that this would happen .
 That's nonsense .
 Really .
 All right .
 But don't cry , said the gentle MrLorry .
 I'm not crying .
 You're crying , said Miss Pross .
 I , my dear Miss Pross .
 By now , MrLorry dared to be nice to her sometimes .
 You were crying just now .
 I saw you , and I'm not surprised about it .
 Your gift of plates and silverware is so impressive that it would make anybody cry .
 There's not a fork or a spoon in the whole collection that didn't make me cry until I couldn't see through my tears when the box arrived last night , said Miss Pross .
 Not at all .
 said Miss Pross .
 You think it's not possible that there could have been a MrsLorry .
 asked MrLorry .
 Pooh .
 answered Miss Pross .
 You were born to be a bachelor .
 And you were made to be a bachelor before you were put into your cradle , continued Miss Pross .
 The doctor offered his arm to Lucie , and he took her downstairs to the chariot that MrLorry had hired for the occasion .
 The rest of them followed in another carriage , and soon Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married privately in a nearby church .
 It was hard for them to say goodbye , though it didn't last long .
 Her father cheered for her , and gently pulling himself away from her embrace , finally said , Take her , Charles .
 She is yours .
 He had kept many of his feelings to himself , of course , and some strong emotions might have been expected to come out of him once the bride and groom had left .
 But what worried MrLorry was the frightened look on the doctor's face , and the fact that the doctor had absent-mindedly grabbed his head in his hands and wandered off into his room when they got upstairs .
 It reminded MrLorry of Defarge , the owner of the wine shop , and their night ride away from Paris under the stars .
 I think it would be best if we didn't talk to him right now or disturb him at all , he whispered to Miss Pross .
 I need to go to Tellson's Bank .
 I'll go there now and come back very soon , and then we will take him on a ride into the country and eat dinner there .
 Everything will be fine .
 It was easier for MrLorry to stop in at Tellson's than it was for him to leave Tellson's .
 He was delayed there for two hours .
 When he came back , he climbed the old staircase alone without bothering the servant .
 On his way into the doctor's rooms , he heard the sound of quiet knocking .
 Good God .
 he said , startled .
 What's that .
 MrLorry looked at what he was working ona shoe of the old size and shape .
 He picked up another shoe that was lying near him and asked what it was .
 It's a young lady's walking shoe , he mumbled without looking up at him .
 I should have finished it a long time ago .
 Leave it alone .
 The doctor looked up at him in his old mechanical and submissive manner without stopping his work .
 Do you know who I am , my dear friend .
 Think again .
 You are not a shoemaker .
 Think , my dear friend .
 MrLorry took these steps hoping that the doctor would get better again .
 If he recovered soon , MrLorry had a plan .
 There was someone who MrLorry thought would understand the doctor's case the best , and MrLorry would ask for this person's opinion on the matter .
 Hoping that the doctor would recover so that he could put this third plan into action , MrLorry decided to watch him closely but to do it as subtly as possible .
 He took time off from Tellson's Bank for the first time in his life and positioned himself in the window in the doctor's room .
 MrLorry soon discovered that it was useless to speak to him since it made him nervous .
 MrLorry gave up on that idea on the first day and decided instead to stay near him at all times and hope that his quiet presence would stop the doctor's delusions , or at least keep them from getting worse .
 MrLorry stayed at his seat near the window reading and writing and showing in as many pleasant ways as possible that it was a place where they were both free to do whatever they wanted .
 Will you go out .
 Out .
 Yes .
 Will you go for a walk with me .
 Why not .
 When it was night again , MrLorry asked him again as he had done before : 
 Dear Doctor , will you go out .
 Like before , the doctor repeated , Out .
 MrLorry was so tired out by anxiously watching the doctor that he fell asleep .
 On the tenth morning of the doctor's illness , MrLorry was startled by the sun shining into the room , since he had dozed off when it was dark night .
 Even when he was sure that he was actually awake , MrLorry wondered for a few moments whether the doctor's recent shoemaking had all been a dream .
 He could see his friend in front of him dressed and looking as usual , and reading as he normally did .
 Was there any sign that the change in the doctor that he had seen during the past few days had actually happened .
 Miss Pross was there within a few minutes , whispering quietly beside MrLorry .
 If he had any doubts left , the way she spoke about the situation would have decided the matter .
 By then , though , he was clearheaded and had no doubts .
 He decided that they should leave the doctor alone until the usual breakfast time , then they would meet the doctor as if nothing unusual had happened .
 If he seemed to be behaving as he typically did , MrLorry would then cautiously start looking for help from the man whose opinion he so anxiously wanted to hear .
 Miss Pross followed his advice and they worked out the plan carefully .
 MrLorry had plenty of time for his usual toilette the process of attending to your personal appearance toilette , and he arrived at breakfast in his usual white linen with his usual tight stockings .
 The doctor was called as usual , and he came to breakfast .
 If I understand correctly , said the doctor quietly , it's about some mental shock .
 Yes .
 Be specific , said the doctor .
 Give me all the details .
 MrLorry saw that the doctor understood him , and he went on .
 The doctor asked in a low voice , For how long .
 Nine days and nights .
 Yes , that's correct .
 Now , did you ever see him doing that activity when he used to do it before, asked the doctor , carefully , 
 Once .
 And when he relapsed , was he in most ways , or in all ways , as he was then .
 I think he was exactly the same .
 You spoke about his daughter .
 Does his daughter know about his relapse .
 No .
 She has not been told , and I hope she will never be told .
 Only myself and one other trustworthy person know about it .
 But I don't know how to begin in such a case , continued MrLorry .
 If your wisdom , knowledge , and experience could put me on the right track , I might be able to do a lot .
 But uninformed and without help , I can't do much of anything .
 Please talk with me about it .
 Please help me understand it better and teach me how to be of more help .
 I think it's likely that the patient may have expected the relapse you have described , said the doctor , requiring an effort to break the silence .
 Was he afraid it might happen again .
 MrLorry asked .
 Very much .
 He said it with an involuntary shudder .
 You have no idea how troublesome such a fear is to a person , and how difficulthow almost impossibleit is for him to make himself talk about the subject that haunts him .
 Would it help him , asked MrLorry , if he could tell someone else that secret when it is bothering him .
 I think so .
 But it is , as I have told you , almost impossible .
 I even think that , in some cases , it is impossible .
 Would he remember what happened during the relapse .
 asked MrLorry hesitantly .
 The doctor looked around the room sadly , shook his head , and answered quietly , Not at all .
 Now , said the doctor , recovering himself , I have great hope .
 It gives me hope that he recovered from his relapse so soon .
 The fact that he gave in to the pressure of whatever was haunting him and recovered after the spell had passed gives me hope that the worst is over .
 Well , well .
 That makes me feel better .
 I am thankful .
 said MrLorry .
 I am also thankful .
 repeated the doctor , bowing his head with respect .
 There are two other things that I would like help with , said MrLorry .
 May I go on .
 You couldn't do your friend a better favor than to continue .
 The doctor gave him his hand .
 I don't think so .
 It may just be the way he is .
 His mind might always need to be occupied .
 That might partly be in his nature and partly a result of the sickness .
 The less his mind is occupied with healthy things , the more it would be in danger of focusing on unhealthy things .
 He may have noticed this about himself .
 You're sure that he is not under too much stress .
 I think I am quite sure of it .
 My dear Manette , if he were overworked now .
 The occupation the patient took up during this temporary relapse said MrLorry , clearing is throat , we will call it Ã«blacksmith's work .
 ' Let's say that during the dark times in his past , the patient used to work at a little forge .
 Let's say that we unexpectedly found him at his forge again .
 Isn't it bad for him to keep it close to him .
 The doctor covered his eyes with his hand and tapped his foot nervously on the ground .
 He has always kept it by him , said MrLorry , looking anxiously at the doctor .
 Now , wouldn't it be better to let it go .
 The doctor kept his eyes shaded and kept tapping his foot nervously on the ground .
 Do you find it difficult to give me advice .
 said MrLorry .
 I think it's a good question .
 And yet , I think Then he shook his head and stopped talking .
 He looked a lot like a lost child as he looked up at MrLorry .
 There was another silence .
 You see too , said the doctor , nervously , it is like an old friend .
 I wouldn't keep it , said MrLorry , shaking his head .
 He became more confident as he saw that the doctor was uneasy .
 I would tell the patient to give it up .
 I only lack your power to do it .
 I am sure it does no good .
 Come on .
 Give me your permission , like a good man .
 For his daughter's sake , my dear Manette .
 It was very strange to see the struggle going on within the doctor .
 For her sake , then , let it be done .
 I allow it .
 But I would not take it away while he is there .
 Take it away when is not there .
 Let him miss his old friend after he is gone .
 MrCarton waited until he had a chance to take Darnay aside to a window to speak to him privately .
 I hope that we are already friends , said MrDarnay .
 Naturally , Charles Darnay asked him what he meant .
 I remember a certain evening when you made me admit to you that you had been drinking .
 I'm not worried .
 When you are sincere it doesn't worry me at all .
 Ah .
 said Carton , waving his hand casually as if he were waving away MrDarnay's comment .
 On the drunken night in questionone of many drunken nights for me , as you knowI was rudely speaking about whether I liked you or disliked you .
 I hope you will forget all about it .
 I forgot about it a long time ago .
 You're just being polite again .
 But , MrDarnay , it is not as easy for me to forget things as you claim it is for you .
 I haven't forgotten it at all , and a casual answer doesn't help me forget it .
 Please forgive me if it was a casual answer , answered Darnay .
 I was only trying to take a minor incident that seems , to my surprise , to bother you too much and put it behind us .
 I give you my word as a gentleman that I forgot about it a long time ago .
 Good Heaven , what was there to forget .
 Didn't you do a great favor for me that day that I should remember .
 I need to tell you that the great favor I did for you was actually just professional nonsense , said Carton .
 I don't think that I cared what happened to you when I did it .
 Mind you , I'm saying that that is how I felt back then .
 I am speaking about the past .
 I would rather form my own opinion without hearing from MrStryver .
 Well , at any rate you know that I'm a depraved dog .
 I've never done anything good in my life and never will .
 I don't know if its true that you never will .
 Will you try to come .
 That's another way of saying that you will grant me what I've asked .
 Thank you , MrDarnay .
 I may say that you and I are friends .
 I should think by now that you would , MrCarton .
 They shook hands on the matter , and Sydney Carton turned away .
 Less than a minute afterward he was as unnoticeable as ever .
 He had no idea that his beautiful young wife might be thinking about MrCarton , too .
 But later , when he joined her in their own rooms , she was waiting for him with the usual pretty frown on her forehead .
 You look concerned about something tonight .
 said Darnay , putting his arm around her .
 Yes , dearest Charles , she said , with her hands on his chest , She looked at him with a questioning expression .
 I am rather concerned tonight , for I have something on my mind .
 What is it , my Lucie .
 Will you promise not to ask any questions of me if I ask you not to .
 Will I promise .
 What wouldn't I promise you , my love .
 He brushed her golden hair from her cheek and placed his other hand against her heart .
 I think , Charles , that poor MrCarton deserves more consideration and respect than you gave him tonight .
 Really , my love .
 Why do you say so .
 That is the question you shouldn't ask me .
