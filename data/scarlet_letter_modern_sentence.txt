 This sketch of the Custom House takes the polite step , as is common in literature , of explaining how the story that follows came into my possession , and offering proof that the story is real .
 I’m only writing this sketch and addressing the public personally because I want to say that I am not the author of The Scarlet Letter , but merely its editor , or a little more than its editor .
 While explaining how The Scarlet Letter came into my hands , I’ve also added a few details about a previously undescribed way of life and the characters who live it—one of whom happens to be me .
 
.
 There’s a moral aspect to this connection , as well .
 For as long as I can remember , I have known about my first Salem ancestor , that dim and grand figure .
 The idea of him still haunts me and makes me feel as though my home is Old Salem , not the run-down port town Salem is today .
 I feel bound to the town today because of this serious , bearded , sable-cloaked man who , with his Bible and his sword , once walked the new streets of Salem with a stately air .
 He was a large figure , a man of war and peace .
 By comparison , I’m almost anonymous .
 He was a soldier , a legislator , and a judge .
 He was a powerful minister , with both the good and the evil traits of the Puritans .
 He persecuted many people .
 The Quakers remember him for that , particularly for his severe judgment of one woman , which may last longer than the record of his many good deeds .
 His son inherited the same fondness for persecution : He convicted so many witches that you could say their blood is on his hands .
 The stain is so deep that it must still be on his dry old bones , if they haven’t crumbled to dust yet .
 I don’t know whether these ancestors of mine repented for their cruelties or whether they are now groaning in Hell .
 As their representative , I take their shame on myself and pray that any curse on their dreary descendents will be removed .
 
.
 They must have quickly realized I was harmless .
 So with light hearts and the happy knowledge that they were usefully employed the jobs were useful to them , even if they weren’t much use to the country these good old men went through the motions .
 Looking wisely under their spectacles , they peeped into the holds of mighty ships .
 They made a big fuss about little things and showed an amazing ability to let serious matters slip through their fingers .
 Whenever something bad happened—for example , when an entire wagonload of valuable goods was smuggled ashore at noon , right underneath their unsuspicious noses—nothing could outdo their fast and useless reaction .
 They’d lock and double-lock and tape up and wax over every opening of the ship .
 Instead of scolding them for their negligence , it seemed I was supposed to praise them for springing into action the moment there was nothing left to do .
 
.
 It’s a foolish habit of mine to be nice to anyone who isn’t extremely irritating .
 If a man has strong points , I focus on those .
 Since most of these old Custom House officials had good traits , and since my paternal , protective position created a friendly environment , I grew to like them all .
 On summer mornings , when heat that would liquefy younger people only warmed these old ones , it was nice to hear them all chatting in the back entry , chairs tipped against the wall , as usual .
 They would thaw out and tell the frozen old jokes of past generations .
 On the outside , the jolliness of old men is like the happiness of children .
 There is nothing deep or intellectual about it .
 Both the elderly and the young light up with laughter on their surface , whether that surface is a green branch or a gray , moldy trunk .
 But for the young that light is real sunshine .
 for the aged , it’s the glow of decaying wood .
 
.
 It would be unfair , you must understand , to suggest that all of my officers were senile .
 For starters , they weren’t all old .
 Some were in their prime , skillful and energetic , and much better than the sluggish jobs they’d been cursed with .
 And sometimes white hair covered a brain that worked well .
 But most of them were wearying old souls who had gained little of value from their wide experience .
 In terms of wisdom , they’d thrown out the baby and kept the bathwater .
 They spoke with far more interest about today’s breakfast , or yesterday’s , today’s , or tomorrow’s dinner than about the shipwrecks and wonders their youthful eyes had seen .
 
.
 One great advantage the Inspector had over animals was his ability to remember good dinners , which had given his life so much happiness .
 His love of food was a wonderful trait : To hear him talk of roast meat made me as hungry as eating an appetizer .
 Since he had no higher sensibilities , he didn’t sacrifice any spirituality by devoting all his energy to pleasing his mouth .
 Because I didn’t have to worry about his nonexistent soul , I always enjoyed listening to him talk about fish , poultry , and meat and how best to cook them .
 When he described a feast , no matter how long ago he had enjoyed it , it was like the smell of the pig or turkey was right under your nose .
 He could taste flavors that hit his palate sixty or seventy years ago as clearly as the meat he’d just devoured for breakfast .
 I have heard him smack his lips remembering dinner parties , every guest at which besides him has been worm food for years .
 It was amazing to see how the ghosts of long-ago meals were always rising up before him—not in anger or blame , but as if they were grateful for the appreciation .
 It was as if the ghosts wanted to recreate old pleasures .
 The piece of beef , veal , pork , chicken , or turkey he might have eaten when John Adams was president are all remembered to this day .
 Not so all the history he’s seen , nor the successes and failures of his career .
 Those have affected him as little as a passing breeze .
 As far as I can tell , the most tragic event of the old man’s life was a mishap with a certain goose , which lived and died twenty or forty years ago .
 The bird looked quite delicious but turned out to be so tough that the carving knife couldn’t cut it , and it had to be tackled with an axe and a saw .
 
.
 But it is time to abandon this sketch of the Inspector , though I would be glad to dwell on it a lot longer , since of all the men I have known , he was the best suited to being a Custom House officer .
 Most people , for reasons I may not have the space to explain , are morally weakened by this job .
 But the old Inspector was incapable of being corrupted , since there was nothing in him to corrupt .
 Had he remained at the Custom House until the end of time , he would emerge just as good as when he went in , and sit down to dinner with just as good an appetite .
 
.
 I looked at the old warrior with affection .
 We hadn’t talked much , but like all the men and animals who knew him , it’s fair to say I felt affectionate about him .
 And through these kind eyes , I could see the main points of his portrait .
 His noble and heroic qualities showed that his reputation was well deserved .
 I can’t imagine that he was ever restless .
 It must have taken a certain impulse to set him in motion .
 Once he was stirred up , though , and had obstacles to overcome and a worthy goal , it wasn’t in the man to quit or fail .
 Heat had once defined him , and wasn’t extinct yet .
 That heat was never the kind that flashes and flickers .
 rather , it was a deep red glow , like iron in a furnace .
 Old as he was when I met him , the man still exuded weight , solidity , and firmness .
 I could imagine that even at his age he could throw off his infirmities like a hospital gown and become a warrior once more , if the moment called for it .
 And even then he would have kept his calm demeanor .
 Such a moment , however , was only to be imagined , not expected or even desired .
 What I saw in the General—who was like a wall that remains standing in a ruin—was endurance , which might well have been stubborn hard-headedness in his younger days .
 integrity , which was so heavy it was as immovable as a ton of iron .
 and benevolence , which , though he’d led bayonet charges , was as genuine as an philanthropist’s .
 He may have killed men with his own hands for all I know , and he certainly killed them with his troops , but there wasn’t enough cruelty in his heart to brush the down off a butterfly’s wing .
 I have not met a kinder man .
 
.
 In the meantime , there I was : a Surveyor Chief administrator of the Custom House .
 Surveyor of the Revenue , and a good one at that .
 A man of intelligence , imagination , and taste can become a man of business if he chooses .
 My fellow officers and the others who dealt with me thought me no different from anyone else in the Custom House .
 None of them had read a page of my writing , nor would have thought more of me had they read every last one .
 It wouldn’t have mattered if my poor pages had been written by Burns or Chaucer—both Custom House officers in their day .
 It’s good , if hard , for a writer who dreams of literary fame to realize that outside his own little circle , he’s completely insignificant and unknown .
 I don’t think I really needed that lesson , but I learned it well .
 I’m proud to say that it didn’t even hurt .
 In the way of literary talk , it’s true that the Naval Officer a very good man who worked with me would often talk to me about Napoleon or Shakespeare .
 And the Collector’s young assistant was rumored to write poetry at work .
 We’d talk about books now and then , as though I might know something about them .
 This was the sum of my literary conversation , and it was quite sufficient for my needs .
 
.
 But the past was not yet dead .
 Once in a long while , my thoughts from years gone by were revived again .
 It was one of those occasions , when my writerly habits reappeared , that justifies the publication of this sketch .
 
.
 Few records survive from before the Revolution .
 Those older documents were probably carried off by the British army when it retreated from Boston to Halifax .
 I have often regretted that .
 Those papers , some going back as far as the English Revolution , more than a hundred years before our own , must have contained references to forgotten men and obscure customs that would have given me the same pleasure I used to get from picking up Indian arrowheads in the field by my house .
 
.
 But during all of my time at the Custom House , moonlight , sunshine , and the glow of a fire all seemed the same to me .
 None of them did a thing more for me than the light of a common candle .
 My writing gift might not have been very rich or valuable , but it was the best I had , and it was gone .
 
.
 Yet I think if I had tried to write in a different way , I would not have been so frustrated .
 I could have written the stories one of the Inspectors told .
 An old ship captain , he made me laugh with his marvelous tales almost every day .
 If I could have preserved his forceful style and humorous descriptions , the result would have been something new in literature .
 Or I could have found a more serious undertaking .
 It was foolish , with the reality of this daily life pressing on me , to try to fling myself back into another age or to create an imaginary world out of thin air .
 Every soap bubble of imagination was popped when I came back into contact with the real world .
 It would have been wiser to work from and transform the world around me in writing .
 I could have found the true value in the trivial happenings and ordinary men that made up my daily life .
 The fault was mine .
 My life seemed dull because I hadn’t understood its deeper meaning .
 There was a better book in the reality of that experience than I will ever write .
 It showed itself to me page after page , vanishing as fast as it was written because my brain lacked the insight and my hand lacked the skill to copy it down .
 Maybe some day I will recall bits and pieces of my life in that place and write about it .
 I suspect my writing would turn to gold on the page .
 
.
 Though my situation wasn’t pleasant , I saw good reason to congratulate myself for being on the election’s losing side .
 Though I hadn’t taken sides in the election , I began to take sides after it .
 I was pretty sure where my affections lay , and I was sorry and a little embarrassed that my fellow Democratic colleagues might lose their jobs while I kept mine .
 But who can see even a moment into the future .
 My head was the first to go .
 
.
 A crowd of dreary-looking men and women stood outside of a heavy oak door studded with iron spikes .
 
.
 Ladies ,  said one hard-faced woman of fifty , I’ll give you a piece of my mind .
 It would serve the public good if mature , church-going women like us were allowed to deal with hussies like Hester Prynne .
 What do you say , ladies .
 If the five of us passed judgment on this slut , would she have gotten off as lightly as she has before the magistrates .
 I don’t think so .
 
.
 People say ,  said another woman , that the Reverend Master Dimmesdale , her pastor , is very grieved that a scandal like this has occurred in his congregation .
 
.
 Well ,  interrupted a young wife , holding her child by the hand , she can cover the mark however she likes , but it will still weigh on her heart .
 
.
 Why talk about marks and brands , whether they’re on her gown or the skin of her forehead .
  shouted another woman , the most ugly and merciless of this self-righteous and judgmental group .
 This woman has brought shame to all of us , and she ought to die .
 Isn’t there a law that says so .
 There truly is , in both the Bible and the statutes .
 The magistrates will have only themselves to thank when , having disregarded these laws , they find that their wives and daughters are sleeping around .
 
.
 The young woman was tall and elegant .
 Her thick , dark hair gleamed in the sunlight .
 Her beautiful face , with well-formed features and perfect complexion , was impressive in a way that young faces rarely are .
 She held herself in a stately and dignified manner , like upper-class ladies of that time , not delicate like women are today .
 And Hester Prynne had never appeared more ladylike than when she stepped out from that prison .
 Those who knew her and expected to see her diminished by her circumstance were startled to find that her beauty radiated like a halo to obscure the clouds of misfortune that surrounded her .
 Even so , the sensitive observer might have detected something exquisitely painful in the scene .
 Her outfit , which she had fashioned for the occasion while in her cell , was extravagant in a way that seemed to reflect her reckless mood .
 But all eyes were drawn to the embroidered scarlet letter , which so transformed its wearer that people who had known Hester Prynne felt they were seeing her for the first time .
 The letter had the effect of a spell , removing her from ordinary humanity and placing her in a world by herself .
 
.
 It would be well-deserved ,  muttered a hard-faced old woman , if we tore Madame Hester’s rich gown off her precious shoulders .
 As for the red letter which she has so skillfully made , I’ll give her a scrap of my own crimson flannel to make a better one .
 
.
 Oh quiet , ladies , quiet .
  whispered their youngest companion .
 Don’t let her hear you .
 Every stitch in that letter took a toll on her heart .
 
.
 The grim beadle made a gesture with his staff .
 
.
 Scaffolds may seem like little more than historical curiosities now , but they once formed an integral part of a penal system that was thought to promote good citizenship as effectively as the guillotines of the French Revolution .
 The scaffold was the site of public humiliation .
 On it stood the pillory , a device that held the human head steady , exhibiting it to the public gaze .
 The very idea of shame was embodied in this frame of wood and iron .
 No matter how bad the offense , there is nothing more severe , I think , than to forbid someone to hide his face in shame .
 This punishment did precisely that .
 In Hester Prynne’s case , as sometimes happens , her sentence required her to stand for a certain time on the platform , but without having her head held still—the worst part of the punishment .
 Knowing her role , she climbed the wooden steps and stood on display above the crowd .
 
.
 The scene was somewhat awful , as spectacles of guilt and shame always are , until that time when society becomes so corrupt that it laughs when it should be shuddering .
 The witnesses of Hester Prynne’s disgrace were still simple , innocent folk .
 They were stern enough to have watched her execution—had she been sentenced to die—without uttering a word about the cruelty of it .
 But they were not so heartless as to joke about the matter .
 And even if they had wanted to laugh , the presence of the governor and his advisers , a judge , a general , and the town’s ministers standing in the church balcony would have kept them quiet .
 When important men like these could participate in this kind of event without risking their reputations , it signified that these sentences were a serious matter .
 The crowd was fittingly solemn , and the unhappy criminal handled herself as best a woman could with a thousand merciless eyes fixated on her bosom .
 The situation was nearly intolerable .
 Impulsive and passionate by nature , Hester Prynne had prepared herself for the stings and stabs of public scorn , which might come in any variety of insult .
 But the gloomy , serious mood of the crowd was much worse .
 She wished that everyone would laugh and shout at her instead .
 If they had only laughed , Hester Prynne could return a bitter , disdainful smile .
 But under the heavy weight of their solemnity , she felt at times that she would either cry out with all her might and hurl herself off of the platform or else go mad .
 
.
 He was a short man with a face that was wrinkled but not that old .
 His features indicated great intelligence , as though he had so cultivated his mind that it began to shape his body .
 It was clear to Hester Prynne that one of the man’s shoulders rose higher than the other , though the man had tried to conceal the fact with a seemingly careless arrangement of his strange clothing .
 Upon first seeing that thin face and slightly deformed figure , Hester pressed her infant to her breast so hard that the poor child cried out .
 But Hester did not seem to hear it .
 
.
 My dear sir , may I ask who is this woman .
 And why is she being held up for public shame .
 
.
 You speak the truth ,  replied the other .
 I am a stranger .
 I have been wandering , against my will , for a long time .
 I have suffered terrible bad luck at sea and on land .
 I have been held prisoner by the Indians to the south , and have been brought here by this Indian to be ransomed from captivity .
 So could I ask you to tell me of Hester Prynne’s—if I have her name right—of this woman’s crimes and why she is standing on this platform .
 
.
 Ah .
 Aha .
 I understand you ,  said the stranger with a bitter smile .
 A man as wise as you say he was should have learned of that danger in his books .
 And who , beg your pardon , sir , is the father of the young child—some three of four months old , it seems—that Mistress Prynne is holding in her arms .
 
.
 To tell the truth , friend , that’s still a puzzle , and the Daniel Biblical prophet who interpreted dreams and visions in the court of King Nebuchadnezzar .
 Daniel who can solve it has not been found ,  answered the townsman .
 Madame Hester absolutely refuses to speak , and the magistrates have put their heads together in vain .
 Perhaps the guilty man stands here in the crowd , observing this sad spectacle , and forgetting that God sees him when no one else does .
 
.
 That wise scholar ,  observed the stranger with another smile , should come here to look into the mystery .
 
.
 While this was going on , Hester Prynne stood on her platform , eyes still fixed upon the stranger .
 She stared so intently that sometimes the rest of the world seemed to vanish , leaving only the two of them .
 Perhaps such a private interview would have been even more terrible than the encounter they were having now : the noonday sun burning her face and illuminating its shame .
 the scarlet letter on her breast .
 the child , conceived in sin , resting in her arms .
 the crowd , assembled as though for a festival , staring at her features , which would have otherwise only been visible in the intimacy of the fireside , in the quiet of her home , or beneath a veil at church .
 As terrible as it was , she felt that these thousand witnesses were sheltering her .
 It was better to stand before all of them than to meet this stranger alone and face-to-face .
 She took refuge in her public exposure and dreaded the moment when its protection would be taken from her .
 Absorbed in these thoughts , she barely heard the voice behind her until it had repeated her name more than once , in a loud and serious tone that the whole crowd could hear .
 
.
 Hear me , Hester Prynne .
  said the voice .
 
.
 Good Master Dimmesdale ,  he said , you are responsible for this woman’s soul .
 You ought , therefore , to encourage her to repent and to confess as proof of her repentance .
 
.
 Speak to the woman , my brother ,  said MrWilson .
 It is essential to her soul and , therefore , as the honorable Governor says , essential to yours as well , since you are responsible for hers .
 Tell her to confess the truth .
 
.
 The Reverend MrDimmesdale bowed his head in what appeared to be silent prayer and then stepped forward .
 
.
 Hester shook her head .
 
.
 Woman , do not test the limits of Heaven’s mercy .
  cried the Reverend MrWilson , more harshly than before .
 Your little baby , being granted a voice , agrees with the advice that you have heard .
 Reveal the name .
 That act , and your repentance , may be enough to remove the scarlet letter from you breast .
 
.
 I will not speak .
  answered Hester , turning pale as death , but responding to this voice , which she recognized all too well .
 My child must seek a heavenly father .
 she will never have an earthly one .
 
.
 She will not speak .
  murmured MrDimmesdale , who had been leaning over the balcony with his hand over his heart as he had waited to see how Hester would respond .
 Now he drew back with a deep breath .
 The strength and generosity of a woman’s heart .
 She will not speak .
 
.
 Please , friend , leave me alone with my patient ,  said the stranger .
 Trust me , my good jailer—there will be peace here shortly .
 And I promise you that Mistress Prynne will be more obedient from now on .
 
.
 My studies in alchemy ,  he said , and my travels for more than a year among the Indians , who know the medical properties of many plants , have made me a better doctor than many who went to school for it .
 Here , woman—the child is yours , not mine .
 She won’t recognize my voice or my face .
 Give her this potion yourself .
 
.
 Hester , staring with fear into his face , refused to take the medicine .
 
.
 Would you take your revenge on this innocent child .
  she whispered .
 
.
 I have thought about death ,  she said , wished for it .
 I would even have prayed for it if I were worthy to pray .
 Yet if this cup is full of death , think twice before you watch me drink it .
 Look—the cup is at my lips .
 
.
 So drink it ,  he replied with the same cold expression .
 Do you know me so poorly , Hester Prynne .
 Are my aims that petty .
 Even if I had dreamed up a scheme for revenge , how I could I do better than to let you live , to give you every good medicine I know , so that this burning shame could remain on your bosom .
  As he spoke , he placed his long forefinger on the scarlet letter , which seemed to burn Hester’s breast as though it had been red hot .
 He saw her flinch with pain , and he smiled .
 Live , and carry your punishment with you : In the eyes of men and women , in the eyes of the man you called your husband , and in the eyes of that child .
 Drink this potion and live .
 
.
 You know ,  said Hester , who even as depressed as she was could not take that last little insult , you know that I was honest with you .
 I felt no love for you and did not pretend to feel any .
 
.
 I have greatly wronged you ,  mumbled Hester .
 
.
 We have wronged each other ,  he answered .
 My wrong was the first : I tricked your youth and beauty into an unnatural marriage with my decrepitude .
 I haven’t read all that philosophy for nothing : I learned enough to seek no revenge and plot no evil against you .
 You and I are even .
 But , Hester , there is a man who has wronged us both .
 Who is he .
 
.
 Do not ask .
  replied Hester Prynne , looking him firmly in the face .
 You will never know .
 
.
 The eyes of the wrinkled scholar glowed so intensely that Hester Prynne put her hand over her heart to keep him from reading the secret hidden there .
 
.
 Why do you want this .
  asked Hester , shrinking from this secret bond , though she hardly knew why .
 Why not reveal yourself to everyone and denounce me openly .
 
.
 Perhaps ,  he replied , because I want to avoid the dishonor that comes to the husband of a cheating woman .
 Or perhaps I have other reasons .
 It should be enough for you that I wish to live and die unknown .
 So tell the world that your husband is already dead , and never to be heard from again .
 Give no hint that you recognize me .
 Most of all , do not tell your man about me .
 If you fail me in this , beware .
 His reputation , his career , and his life will be in my hands .
 Beware .
 
.
 I will keep your secret , as I have kept his ,  said Hester .
 
.
 Swear to it .
  he replied .
 
.
 And she swore the oath .
 
.
 Not your soul ,  he answered , with another smile .
 Oh , no , not yours .
 
.
 So Hester Prynne did not leave .
 On the outskirts of town , far from other houses , sat a small cottage .
 It had been built by an earlier settler but was abandoned because the surrounding soil was too sterile for planting and it was too remote .
 It stood on the shore , looking across the water at the forest-covered hills to the west .
 A clump of scrubby trees did not so much conceal the cottage as suggest that it was meant to be hidden .
 The magistrates granted Hester a license—though they kept close watch on her—and so she took what money she had and settled with her infant child in this lonesome little home .
 A shadow of mystery and suspicion immediately descended on the cottage .
 Children would creep close enough to watch Hester sewing , or standing in the doorway , or working in her little garden , or walking along the path to town .
 Though they were too young to understand why this woman had been shunned , they would run off with a strange fear when they saw the scarlet letter on her breast .
 
.
 Hester’s imagination was somewhat affected by the strange and lonely pain of her life .
 Walking here and there , with lonely footsteps , in the little world she was superficially connected to , it sometimes seemed to Hester that the scarlet letter had given her a new sense .
 It scared her , but she couldn’t help believing that the letter gave her a sympathetic knowledge of the sin hidden in other people’s hearts .
 She was terrified by the revelations that came to her this way .
 What were they .
 Could they be nothing more than the whispers of the Devil , who tried to convince Hester that the seeming purity of others was merely a lie , and that many breasts beside hers deserved a scarlet letter .
 Or was her awareness of the sins of others—so strange , and yet so clear—real .
 In all of her miserable experience , there was nothing so awful as this sensation .
 It struck her at the most inappropriate moments , shocking and confusing her .
 Sometimes her red mark of shame would throb in sympathy as she passed a respected minister or magistrate , models of holiness and justice who were regarded as almost angelic in those days .
 What evil thing is near .
  Hester would ask herself .
 As she looked up reluctantly , she would find only this earthly saint .
 This same mystical sympathy would rudely assert itself when she met the frown of some older lady who was thought to have been pure and frigid her entire life .
 What could the coldness within that matron’s breast have in common with the burning shame upon Hester Prynne’s .
 Or , again , an electric shock would warn her : Look , Hester , here is a companion .
  Looking up , she would find the eyes of a young maiden glancing shyly at the scarlet letter and turning quickly away with a faint blush , as though her purity were somehow spoiled by that brief glance .
 Oh Devil , whose symbol that scarlet letter was , would you leave nothing—young or old—for Hester to admire .
 Such loss of faith is always one of the saddest results of sin .
 Hester Prynne struggled to believe that no other person was guilty like her .
 Her struggle was proof that this victim of human weakness and man’s strict law was not entirely corrupt .
 
.
 In truth , the little Puritans—some of the least tolerant children who ever lived—had gotten a vague idea that there was something bizarre and unnatural about this mother and child .
 The children felt scorn in their hearts for the two and often mocked them out loud .
 Pearl felt their scorn and often repaid it with the bitterest hatred that a child can muster .
 These fierce outbursts gave Hester a strange comfort because at least she knew that her daughter was acting and speaking in earnest .
 So much of the time , Pearl’s moods were contrary and perverse and frustrated her mother .
 But even so , Hester was appalled to detect in her daughter a reflection of the evil that had existed in herself .
 Pearl had inherited all of this hatred and passion , as if by right , directly from Hester’s heart .
 Mother and daughter stood together , excluded from human society .
 Pearl exhibited the same wild nature that had distracted Hester Prynne before her daughter’s birth but that motherhood had begun to soften away .
 
.
 Gazing at Pearl , Hester Prynne often let her needlework fall from her lap and cried out with an agony she would have rather hidden : Oh Father in Heaven , if You are still my Father , who is this person I have brought into the world .
  And Pearl , either overhearing her mother’s cries or somehow aware of them , would turn her rosy , beautiful little face to Hester , smile with fairylike intelligence , and resume her play .
 
.
 What are you , child .
  cried Hester .
 
.
 Oh , I am your little Pearl .
  answered the child .
 
.
 Pearl laughed while she spoke , and began to dance with the humorous motion of a little sprite whose next trick might be to fly up the chimney .
 
.
 Are you truly my child .
  asked Hester .
 
.
 The question was not entirely meaningless , but half in earnest at that moment .
 Pearl was so intelligent that her mother half-suspected she must be a magical spirit who was about to reveal herself .
 
.
 You tell me , mother .
  said the child , seriously , coming up to Hester and pressing herself close to her knees .
 Do tell me that .
 
.
 Your heavenly Father sent you .
  answered Hester Prynne .
 
.
 But she said it with a hesitation that the perceptive child noticed .
 Whether because of her own contrariness , or because an evil spirit prompted her , Pearl raised her small forefinger and touched the scarlet letter .
 
.
 He did not send me .
  she cried with certainty .
 I don’t have a heavenly Father .
 
.
 You tell me .
 You tell me .
  repeated Pearl , no longer serious , but laughing and dancing about the floor .
 It’s you who must tell me .
 
.
 But Hester , lost in a dark maze of doubt , could not answer .
 She remembered , with a half-smile and half-shudder , the rumor the townspeople had spread that Pearl was the child of a demon .
 Since old Catholic times , people believed sinful mothers sometimes gave birth to demons who appeared on earth to carry out some wicked act .
 Luther Martin Luther was a 16th-century monk and Catholic Church reformer credited with sparking the Protestant Reformation .
 Luther ’s opponents , for example , spread the rumor that he was such a demon .
 Pearl was not the only child assumed by the New England Puritans to have such an unfortunate origin .
 
.
 There was another reason , more important than the delivery of his embroidered gloves , that Hester wanted to see this powerful man .
 She had learned that some of the leading townspeople , favoring stricter rules in religion and government , wanted to take Pearl away from her .
 These good people , believing Pearl to be demon child and with good reason , argued that their concern for Hester’s soul required them to remove this obstacle from her path to salvation .
 On the other hand , if the child really were capable of spiritual growth , they reasoned that its soul should have a better guardian than Hester Prynne .
 Governor Bellingham was said to be among the more prominent supporters of this plan .
 It may seem odd , perhaps even absurd , that a personal matter like this—which in later days would have been handled by the city council—would have been subject to public debate , with leading politicians taking sides .
 In that simpler time , though , legislators and statesman involved themselves in the slightest matters , even ones much less important than the fate of Hester and her child .
 Not long before the time of our story , a dispute over the ownership of a pig caused not only a bitter debate within the legislature but also led to an important change in the structure of the legislative body .
 
.
 Look—there’s the scarlet letter lady .
 And there’s the little scarlet letter running alongside her .
 Let’s throw mud at them .
 
.
 No , my little Pearl .
  said Hester .
 You have to gather your own sunshine .
 I don’t have any to give you .
 
.
 They approached the front door .
 The doorframe was arched , and on either side was a narrow tower-like projection for the windows and shutters .
 Hester gave a knock on the door’s iron hammer .
 It was answered by one of the Governor’s bond servants : a free-born Englishman who was now an indentured slave for the next seven years .
 During that time he was the property of his master , an object to be bargained over and sold , just like an ox or a stool .
 He wore the traditional clothing of a servant working in noble houses in England .
 
.
 Is the honorable Governor Bellingham in .
  asked Hester .
 
.
 Little Pearl , who was as pleased by the gleaming armor as she had been by the glittering house , spent some time looking into the polished mirror of the breastplate .
 
.
 Mother ,  she cried , I see you here .
 Look .
 Look .
 
.
 Hester looked , humoring the child .
 The large , curved mirror reflected the scarlet letter in huge , exaggerated proportions .
 It was easily Hester’s most prominent feature : She seemed absolutely hidden behind it .
 Pearl pointed upwards to a similar reflection in the headpiece and smiled at her mother with her familiar elfish gleam .
 That look of naughty merriment was also reflected in the mirror , large and intense .
 Hester Prynne felt it couldn’t be the image of her own child but rather that of an imp trying to mold itself into Pearl’s shape .
 
.
 Hush , child , hush .
  her mother pleaded .
 Don’t call out , Pearl .
 I hear voices in the garden .
 The Governor is coming with some gentlemen .
 
.
 In fact , a number of people could be seen walking down the path toward the house .
 Pearl , in defiance of her mother’s attempt to quiet her , gave a loud shriek .
 Then she fell silent—not out of obedience , but because her curiosity was aroused by the appearance of these new people .
 
.
 Two other guests walked behind the Governor and MrWilson .
 You may remember the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale , who played a brief and reluctant role at the scene of Hester Prynne’s public disgrace .
 Close beside him was old Roger Chillingworth , the skilled physician , who had been living in the town for the last two or three years .
 This wise man was well known as both doctor and friend to the young minister , whose health had recently suffered from his sacrificial devotion to his religious duties .
 
.
 The Governor , walking ahead of his visitors , climbed one or two steps and , throwing open the great hall window , found himself right in front of little Pearl .
 The shadow of the curtain fell on Hester Prynne , partially hiding her .
 
.
 Indeed .
  cried good old MrWilson .
 What kind of little scarlet-feathered bird is this .
 I think I’ve seen these sorts of visions when the sun shines through a stained-glass window , casting gold and crimson pictures on the floor .
 But that was back in England .
 Tell me , young one , what are you , and what is wrong with your mother that she dresses you in such strange clothes .
 Are you a Christian child .
 Do you know your prayers .
 Or are you one of those elves or fairies we thought we had left behind us , along with all the other funny Catholic beliefs , in England .
 
.
 I am my mother’s child ,  answered the scarlet vision , and my name is Pearl .
 
.
 Is it really .
  cried the Governor .
 Well , we should have figured the mother of such a child to be a scarlet woman , as that is the appropriate color for a whore .
 But she is here at a good time .
 We’ll look into this matter immediately .
 
.
 I can teach my little Pearl what I have learned from this .
  answered Hester Prynne , placing her finger on the scarlet letter .
 
.
 Woman , that is your badge of shame .
  replied the Governor .
 It is because of the sin indicated by that letter that we want to place the child in other hands .
 
.
 Nonetheless ,  said Hester , calmly , though growing paler , this badge has taught me—it teaches me every day , and it is teaching me right now—lessons that will make my child wiser and better , though they can do me no good .
 
.
 We will be cautious in our judgment ,  said Governor Bellingham , and will think hard on the decision .
 Mister Wilson , please , examine this Pearl—since that is her name—and see if she’s had the kind of Christian upbringing appropriate for her age .
 
.
 Pearl ,  he said , with great seriousness , you must pay attention so that , in time , you can wear in your breast the pearl of great price .
 Can you tell me , my child , who made you .
 
.
 Pearl probably concocted this story after seeing the Governor’s red roses , which were right next to her by the window .
 She may have also remembered the prison rose bush she passed on the way to the Governor’s house .
 
.
 This is awful .
  cried the Governor , slowly recovering from his astonishment at Pearl’s answer .
 This three-year-old child cannot tell who made her .
 Without a doubt , she knows just as little about her soul , its present sinfulness , and its future destiny .
 Gentlemen , I think we know all we need to know .
 
.
 Well said again .
  cried good MrWilson .
 I was worried that the woman was simply trying to make her child look like a clown .
 
.
 You speak with strange conviction , my friend ,  said old Roger Chillingworth , smiling at him .
 
.
 And there is deep meaning in what my young brother has said ,  added the Reverend MrWilson .
 What do you say , my honorable Master Bellingham .
 Hasn’t he made a good case for the poor woman .
 
.
 So he has ,  answered the magistrate .
 He’s convinced me that we should leave things as they are , at least as long as the woman causes no further scandals .
 Even so , we must take care to give the child a proper religious education , whether at your hands or at Master Dimmesdale’s .
 And when she is old enough , the leaders of our congregation must see that she goes to both school and church .
 
.
 That little thing is bewitched , I swear ,  he said to MrDimmesdale .
 She doesn’t need any broomstick to fly .
 
.
 A strange child .
  remarked old Roger Chillingworth .
 It’s easy to see her mother in her .
 Do you think , gentlemen , that some scientific research into that child’s nature would allow us to make a shrewd guess at the identity of her father .
 
.
 Send my regrets , if you like .
  answered Hester , with a triumphant smile .
 I must stay at home and take care of my little Pearl .
 If they had taken her from me , I would have gladly gone to the forest with you and signed my name in the Devil’s book—with my own blood .
 
.
 We’ll have you there some day .
  said the witch-lady , frowning , as she pulled her head back in .
 
.
 Now , if we believe this encounter between Mistress Hibbins and Hester Prynne was authentic—not simply a fable—then we already have evidence supporting the young minister’s argument against breaking the bond between the sinful mother and the fruit of her sin .
 Even this young , the child had saved the mother from Satan’s snare .
 
.
 I need no medicine ,  he said .
 
.
 No ,  replied the young minister , putting his hand to his heart as a flush of pain passed over his face , if I were worthy to walk there , I could be happy to work here .
 
.
 Good men always think too little of themselves ,  said the doctor .
 
.
 This is how the mysterious old Roger Chillingworth came to be medical adviser to Reverend MrDimmesdale .
 Since the doctor was interested in the character of the patient as well as his disease , these two men , so different in age , gradually came to spend a great deal of time together .
 They took long walks by the seashore and in the forest , listening to the splash and murmur of the waves or the solemn song of the wind in the treetops .
 These walks were good for the minister’s health , and they gave the doctor a chance to gather medicinal plants .
 They also spent time at each other’s home .
 The minister was fascinated by this man of science .
 He recognized in him a sophisticated intellect and free-thinking and well-rounded mind not found among his fellow clergymen .
 He was actually a little startled , if not shocked , to find this quality in the doctor .
 MrDimmesdale was a sincerely devoted priest—a true believer—with a carefully developed respect and focused commitment to religious practice , which had deepened in him with time .
 No one would have thought of him as a liberal-minded man .
 He needed to feel the constant pressure of faith around him , supporting him as it confined him within its rigid framework .
 Nonetheless , he occasionally , though hesitantly , enjoyed the relief that comes from hearing a different view of the world .
 It was like a window being opened , admitting fresh air into the stifling study where his life was wasting away amid lamplight or dim sunbeams and the musty odor of his books .
 But that air was too fresh and cold to be breathed with comfort for long .
 So the minister and the doctor would once again retreat into discussions that fell within the church’s narrow view .
 
.
 To sum up , it came to be widely believed that the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale , like other especially holy Christians throughout the ages , was haunted either by Satan himself or by Satan’s messenger in the person of old Roger Chillingworth .
 For a period of time , God would allow this hellish agent to work his way into the minister’s private life and plot against his soul .
 But no sensible man doubted who would triumph in the end .
 The townspeople had every faith that their minister would emerge from the conflict transformed by the glory of his spiritual victory .
 In the meantime , it was sad to think of the great pain he had to endure to achieve this triumph .
 
.
 But to judge from the gloom and terror deep in the poor minister’s eyes , the battle was a hard one , and his victory anything but certain .
 
.
 This man ,  Chillingworth said to himself at one such moment , though everyone thinks he is spiritual , has inherited a wild side from one of his parents .
 Let me dig a little further into that .
 
.
 MrDimmesdale might have seen the doctor’s character more clearly if he had not become suspicious of the whole world .
 Sick hearts are prone to paranoia .
 Because he trusted no man as his friend , he could not recognize a real enemy when one appeared .
 So he kept up friendly relations with the doctor , receiving the old man in his study , or visiting the laboratory and watching him turn herbs into potent medicines .
 
.
 Where ,  he asked , with a sideways glance at the plants , for the minister had developed the odd habit of never looking straight at anything , where , my kind doctor , did you gather herbs with such a dark , flabby leaf .
 
.
 Maybe ,  said MrDimmesdale , he truly wanted to confess but could not .
 
.
 Then why not reveal it here .
  asked Roger Chillingworth , glancing quietly at the minister .
 Why shouldn’t the guilty ones enjoy this unspeakable relief sooner .
 
.
 Most of them do ,  said the minister , gripping his breast hard as though suffering a sharp pain .
 Many poor souls have confided in me—not just the ones on their deathbeds , but also those in the prime of life and enjoying a good reputation .
 And always , after a great outpouring , those sinful brothers are so relieved .
 It’s as if they’re finally able to breathe fresh air after having suffocated on their own polluted breath .
 How could it be any other way .
 Why would a sick man—someone guilty of murder , for example—prefer to keep the dead corpse buried in his own heart , rather than tossing it out for the universe to care for .
 
.
 And still , some men do bury their secrets ,  observed the calm doctor .
 
.
 These men are fooling themselves ,  said Roger Chillingworth , using a little more emphasis than usual and making a slight gesture with his index finger .
 They are afraid to own up to the shame that is rightfully theirs .
 They may possess a holy love for mankind and keep a desire to serve God in their hearts , but their hearts might also invite evil impulses that breed hellish thoughts .
 If they seek to glorify God , don’t let them lift their unclean hands to Heaven .
 If they wish to serve their fellow men , let them do it by demonstrating the power of conscience , which forces them to shamefully repent .
 Would you have me believe , my wise and pious friend , that a false act is better—can do more for God’s glory , or the welfare of mankind—than God’s own truth .
 Believe me , men who say that are fooling themselves .
 
.
 That may be so ,  said the young minister , indifferently , as though dismissing a discussion he felt was irrelevant or inappropriate .
 He could skillfully avoid any topic that bothered his nervous temperament .
 But now I would ask , my skillful doctor , whether you truly think my weak body has benefited from your kind care .
 
.
 By this time , Roger Chillingworth had approached the window and was smiling down grimly .
 
.
 That child doesn’t care about the law , authority , or public opinion , whether right or wrong ,  he remarked , as much to himself as to his companion .
 The other day , I saw her spray the Governor himself with water at the cattle trough on Spring Lane .
 What , in Heaven’s name , is she .
 Is that imp altogether evil .
 Does she have any feelings .
 Any governing principles .
 
.
 None , except the freedom of a broken law ,  answered MrDimmesdale , in a quiet way , as if he had been discussing the point with himself .
 I don’t know whether she is capable of good .
 
.
 So she pulled her mother away , skipping and dancing ridiculously around the mounds of dead people , as though she was some little creature who had nothing in common with past generations and wanted nothing to do with them .
 It was as if she had been made out of a completely new substance and must be allowed to live her life by her own rules .
 
.
 There goes a woman ,  said Roger Chillingworth , after a pause , who , though her faults are what they are , has none of that mystery of hidden sinfulness you say is so painful for people to bear .
 Is Hester Prynne less miserable , do you think , because of the scarlet letter on her breast .
 
.
 You asked me , a little while ago ,  he said , after some time , for my judgment about your health .
 
.
 I did ,  answered the clergyman , and would be glad to hear it .
 Tell me honestly , please , whether you think I will live or die .
 
.
 I’ll be straight with you ,  said the doctor , still busy with his plants but keeping a watchful eye on MrDimmesdale , the disease is strange .
 I don’t mean the symptoms , at least as far as you have revealed them to me .
 Seeing you every day , my good sir , for many months now , I would think you were a very sick man—though not too sick for an educated and observant physician to cure you .
 I’m not sure what to say : It seems I know the disease , but at the same time , I don’t .
 
.
 You speak in riddles , my learned sir ,  said the pale minister , glancing out the window .
 
.
 I’ll be more plain ,  continued the doctor , and I beg your pardon , sir , for being direct .
 Let me ask , as your friend , as one in charge of your life and bodily health : Have you told me all the symptoms of this disorder .
 
.
 How can you doubt that .
  asked the minister .
 It would be childish to call for a physician and then conceal the illness .
 
.
 Then I will ask no more ,  said the minister , rising somewhat abruptly from his chair .
 You do not , I assume , deal in medicines for the soul .
 
.
 A sickness ,  continued Roger Chillingworth in the same tone , paying no mind to the interruption , but rather standing and confronting the thin , pale-faced minister with his small , dark and deformed figure , a sickness—a sore spot , if we can call it that—in your spirit manifests itself in your body .
 Do you want your doctor to heal that bodily illness .
 How can he unless you first reveal the wound in your soul .
 
.
 He rushed out of the room with a frantic gesture .
 
.
 It’s good to have made this step ,  Roger Chillingworth said to himself , watching the minister go with a grave smile .
 Nothing is lost .
 We’ll soon be friends again .
 But look how passion takes hold of this man and causes him to lose control of himself .
 Other passions could also make him lose control .
 The pious Master Dimmesdale has done something wild before this , in the hot passion of his heart .
 
.
 Not long after the scene described above , the Reverend MrDimmesdale fell into a deep midday sleep while sitting in his chair .
 A large old book was open on the table in front of him .
 It must have been one of the great works from the school of boring literature .
 The overwhelming depth of the minister’s sleep was even more remarkable because he was an incredibly light sleeper , as easily disturbed as a bird on a twig .
 But his soul had fallen into such an unusual slumber that he did not stir when old Roger Chillingworth , with no special care , came into the room .
 The doctor walked right up to his patient , laid his hand on his breast , and pushed aside the robe that had always hid his chest from the doctor’s eye .
 
.
 MrDimmesdale shuddered and stirred slightly .
 
.
 After a brief pause , the doctor turned away .
 
.
 But what distinguished the doctor’s joy from Satan’s was the quality of wonder in it .
 
.
 Following the incident just described , the relationship between the minister and the doctor changed substantially , though it outwardly appeared the same .
 Roger Chillingworth now had a clear path in front of him , even if it was not quite the one he had meant to take .
 And although he seemed calm , gentle , and reasonable , I am afraid there was a hidden well of malice that stirred from inside this poor old man and allowed him to conceive a more personal revenge than anyone else ever could .
 He had made himself the minister’s one trusted friend—the person in whom MrDimmesdale confided all the fear , remorse , agony , ineffective repentance , and sinful thoughts he struggled to keep away .
 The world would have pitied and forgiven him for all that guilty sorrow .
 But instead he only revealed himself to the pitiless and unforgiving doctor .
 All that dark treasure was lavished on the one man who sought to use it for vengeance .
 
.
 The Reverend MrDimmesdale actually attained great popularity through his ministry while suffering with his bodily disease—a disease made all the more torturous by the dark trouble in his soul and the scheming of his deadliest enemy .
 To be honest , his popularity was due in great part to his sorrows .
 The pain endured through his daily life had made his mind , spirit , and sense of empathy almost supernaturally acute .
 His growing fame already overshadowed the somber reputations of even his most well-regarded fellow ministers .
 Some of these men were scholars who had been engaged in their obscure theological studies for longer than MrDimmesdale had been alive .
 Others possessed stronger minds than MrDimmesdale’s , full of a shrewd and rigid understanding of the world .
 Such strict discipline , when mixed with the right amount of religious doctrine , makes for a respectable , effective , and unwelcoming clergyman .
 Still others were truly saintly men whose minds had been expanded by weary hours of patient thought with their books .
 They had been made even holier by their communications with Heaven , achieving almost divine purity while still in their earthly bodies .
 All they lacked was the apostle’s tongue of fire Ability that God granted to the apostles , allowing their speech to be understood by all men in their own language .
 Acts 2 : 6—12 .
 tongue of fire granting them the power to speak to every man’s heart .
 These men would have tried in vain to express their high ideals in humble words and images—that is , if they had ever dreamed of trying .
 Instead , their voices had become distorted on their way down from these great heights .
 
.
 While standing on the platform in this futile charade of repentance , MrDimmesdale was overcome with horror , as though the universe were staring at a scarlet mark on his breast , right over his heart .
 To tell the truth , there had long been a gnawing , poisonous pain in that spot .
 Without the will or power to restrain himself , he cried aloud .
 The cry rang out through the night , bouncing from one house to another and echoing off the distant hills .
 It was as though a horde of devils had made a toy out of the horrible , miserable outcry and were tossing it back and forth .
 
.
 It is done .
  muttered the minister , covering his face with his hands .
 The whole town will awake and rush out to find me here .
 
.
 Seeing the light of Governor Bellingham’s lamp , the old lady quickly extinguished her own and vanished .
 Maybe she flew up to the clouds .
 The minister didn’t see her again that night .
 The magistrate , after cautiously surveying the darkness—which he could see into about as good as if he were looking through stone—drew back from the window .
 
.
 The Reverend MrWilson passed by the platform , holding his ministerial cloak about him with one arm and the lantern in front of him with the other .
 Dimmesdale could hardly keep from speaking : 
.
 Good evening to you , Reverend Father Wilson .
 Come up here , please , and spend a fine hour with me .
 
.
 Pearl .
 Little Pearl .
  he cried , after a moment .
 Then , in a quieter voice , Hester .
 Hester Prynne .
 Are you there .
 
.
 Where are you coming from , Hester .
  asked the minister .
 What’s brought you here .
 
.
 Come up here , Hester , you and little Pearl ,  said the Reverend MrDimmesdale .
 You have been here before , but I was not with you .
 Come up here once more , and we will stand all three together .
 
.
 Minister .
  whispered little Pearl .
 
.
 What it is , child .
  asked MrDimmesdale .
 
.
 Will you stand here with mother and me at noontime tomorrow .
  asked Pearl .
 
.
 Pearl laughed and tried to pull her hand away .
 But the minister held it tight .
 
.
 One moment more , my child .
  he said .
 
.
 But will you promise ,  asked Pearl , to take my hand , and mother’s hand , tomorrow at noon .
 
.
 Not then , Pearl ,  said the minister , but another time .
 
.
 What other time .
  the child asked persistently .
 
.
 At the great judgment day ,  whispered the minister .
 Oddly enough , his sense of obligation as a teacher of the truth compelled him to give that answer .
 Then and there , before the throne of judgment , your mother , you , and I must stand together .
 But the light of this world will not see us as one .
 
.
 Pearl laughed again .
 
.
 Little Pearl’s eyes took on a bewitched look .
 As she glanced up at the minister , her face wore that naughty , elfish smile .
 She pulled her hand back from MrDimmesdale’s and pointed across the street .
 But he clasped both his hands over his breast and looked up at the sky .
 
.
 Who is that man , Hester .
  gasped MrDimmesdale , overcome with terror .
 The sight of him makes me shiver .
 Do you know who he is .
 I hate him , Hester .
 
.
 She remembered her vow and remained silent .
 
.
 Minister ,  said little Pearl , I can tell you who he is .
 
.
 Quickly then , child .
  said the minister , bending his ear close to her lips .
 Quickly .
 —and as soft as you can whisper .
 
.
 Are you mocking me .
  asked the minister .
 
.
 You weren’t brave .
 You weren’t honest .
  answered the child .
 You wouldn’t promise to take my hand , and my mother’s hand , tomorrow at noon .
 
.
 How did you know I was here .
  asked the minister , fearfully .
 
.
 I’ll go home with you ,  said MrDimmesdale .
 
.
 With a chilling hopelessness , like one who wakes up trembling after a nightmare , he let the doctor lead him away .
 
.
 It was found this morning ,  said the sexton , on the platform where sinners are exhibited to public shame .
 Satan dropped it there , I presume , in a despicable joke against you .
 But the Devil was blind and foolish , as he always is .
 A pure hand needs no glove to cover it .
 
.
 Thank you , my good friend ,  said the minister , sounding calm and serious , though fear was in his heart .
 His memory of the previous night was so muddled , he had nearly convinced himself it was all in his imagination .
 Yes , this does seem to be my glove .
 
.
 And , since Satan saw fit to steal it , from now on the gloves must come off when you fight with him ,  the old sexton said , smiling grimly .
 But did you hear of the sign that was seen last night .
 A great red letter appeared in the sky—the letter A—which we take to stand for ‘Angel .
 ’ Since our good Governor Winthrop became an angel last night , it is fitting that there should be some sign to mark the event .
 
.
 But only a house of sickness or sadness could hold her .
 When life brightened again , she was no longer there .
 Her shadow faded from the doorway .
 The helper departed without looking back for any sign of gratitude in the hearts of those she had served .
 When she passed them on the street , she never raised her head to greet them .
 If they persisted in approaching her , she pointed to the scarlet letter and walked on by .
 Hester may have been acting this way out of pride , but it seemed so much like humility that the public reacted as though it truly were .
 The public often acts like a fickle king .
 When justice is called for too aggressively , the public will often deny it .
 But that same public often goes overboard—just as a king would—in granting justice when the appeal is made to its generosity .
 Thinking that Hester Prynne’s actions were an appeal to its generous nature , society was inclined to be more kind than she wanted , or perhaps than she even deserved .
 
.
 The rulers—the wise and learned men of the community—took longer than the common people to acknowledge Hester’s good qualities .
 They shared the same prejudices as the rest of the community , and their rigorous reasoning worked to hold those prejudices firmly in place .
 Yet , day by day , their sour faces relaxed into something that might eventually become a kind expression .
 The same was true for the men of high status , whose lofty positions made them the guardians of public virtue .
 But almost everyone had privately forgiven Hester Prynne for her human weakness .
 Even more than that , they had begun to look at the scarlet letter not as the symbol of one sin but as a symbol of the many good deeds she had done since .
 Do you see that woman with the embroidered badge .
  they would ask strangers .
 That’s our Hester—our own Hester—who is so kind to the poor , so helpful to the sick , so generous to the troubled .
  Truly , the same human tendency to proclaim the worst when embodied in others also restrains them to only whisper about the scandals of the past .
 Nonetheless , even in the eyes of the very same men who talk about the sins of others , the scarlet letter had the effect of a cross on a nun’s bosom .
 It gave the wearer a kind of holiness , enabling her to walk safely though all kinds of danger .
 It would have kept her safe if she had fallen prey to thieves .
 It was rumored—and many believed it—that an Indian’s arrow had struck the letter and fallen harmlessly to the ground .
 
.
 The scarlet letter had not done its job .
 
.
 Meanwhile , her mother had approached the doctor .
 
.
 I would like to talk with you ,  she said , about a matter that concerns us both .
 
.
 Ah .
 Mistress Hester would like to talk with old Roger Chillingworth .
  he answered , raising himself from his stooping position .
 Well , my word .
 I say , Mistress , I hear many good things about you .
 As recently as last night a magistrate , a wise and godly man , was talking about you , Mistress Hester .
 He whispered to me that the council had been debating whether , without endangering public morality , that scarlet letter might be taken off your bosom .
 I swear to you , Hester , I asked that magistrate to see it done immediately .
 
.
 The power of the magistrates cannot take off this symbol ,  Hester replied calmly .
 If I were worthy to have it removed , it would simply fall away—or be transformed into something that would convey a different message .
 
.
 So wear it , if it suits you best ,  he replied .
 A woman must , of course , follow her own whims when it comes to dressing herself .
 The letter is beautifully embroidered , and it sure looks fine on your bosom .
 
.
 The scarlet letter burned on Hester Prynne’s bosom .
 She felt partly responsible for this other ruined life .
 
.
 What do you see in my face ,  asked the doctor , that makes you look at it so intently .
 
.
 I see something that would make me weep , if tears were bitter enough for the sadness ,  she answered .
 But let it pass .
 I would like to talk about that miserable man from the other night .
 
.
 When we last spoke ,  said Hester , some seven years ago , you made me promise to keep our former relationship a secret .
 Since the life and reputation of that man were in your hands , I seemed to have no choice but to keep the secret as you asked .
 But I made that promise with great fear .
 Though I had renounced all duty toward other human beings , I still had a duty towards him .
 Something told me that I was betraying that duty by pledging to keep your secret .
 Since that day , no one has been as close to him as you .
 You follow his every footstep .
 You are beside him when he sleeps and when he is awake .
 You search his thoughts .
 You dig into his heart and make it sore .
 You have a grip on his life that causes him to die a living death every day .
 And yet he does not know the real you .
 By allowing this to happen , I have surely been untrue to the only man that I have the power to be true to .
 
.
 What choice did you have .
  asked Roger Chillingworth .
 If I had pointed my finger at this man , he would have been thrown from his pulpit into prison—and perhaps from there to the gallows .
 
.
 It would have been better that way .
  said Hester Prynne .
 
.
 What evil have I done to this man .
  asked Roger Chillingworth again .
 I tell you , Hester Prynne , the richest king could not have bought the care that I have wasted on this miserable priest .
 If not for my help , his life would have been consumed by his torments within two years of your mutual crime .
 His spirit was not strong enough to bear a burden like your scarlet letter , Hester .
 Oh , I could have revealed the secret .
 But enough of that .
 I have done for him all that medicine can do .
 I am the only reason that he still breathes and crawls this earth .
 
.
 It would have been better if he had died at once .
  said Hester Prynne .
 
.
 As the unfortunate doctor uttered these words , he raised his hands with a look of horror , as though he had looked into a mirror and seen a frightful , unrecognizable shape instead of his own image .
 It was one of those rare moments , which come only once every few years , in which a man sees his true character in his mind’s eye .
 He had probably never seen himself as he did now .
 
.
 Haven’t you tortured him enough .
  said Hester , noticing the old man’s look .
 Hasn’t he repaid you completely .
 
.
 All of that , and more ,  said Hester .
 
.
 And what am I now .
  he demanded , looking into her face and allowing all the evil inside him to appear on his own .
 I have already told you what I am .
 A demon .
 Who made me into this .
 
.
 It was me .
  cried Hester , shuddering .
 It was me as much as him .
 Why haven’t you taken your revenge on me .
 
.
 I have left you to the scarlet letter ,  replied Roger Chillingworth .
 If that has not avenged me , I cannot do anything else .
 
.
 He laid his finger on it , with a smile .
 
.
 It has avenged you .
  Hester Prynne replied .
 
.
 I thought as much ,  said the doctor .
 And now , what would you say to me about this man .
 
.
 Woman , I could almost pity you .
  said Roger Chillingworth , unable to restrain a spark of admiration .
 There was almost a majestic quality in the despair that she expressed .
 You had great qualities .
 Perhaps , if you had earlier found a better love than mine , all of this evil would not have come about .
 I pity you , for the good in your nature that has been wasted .
 
.
 He waved his hand and began to gather herbs once again .
 
.
 Whether or not it’s a sin ,  said Hester bitterly , as she stared after him , I hate the man .
 
.
 Yes , I hate him .
  repeated Hester , more bitterly than before .
 He betrayed me .
 He has done worse to me than I ever did to him .
 
.
 Men should be afraid to win a woman’s hand in marriage unless they win her complete heart and passion along with it .
 Otherwise it may be their misfortune , as it was Roger Chillingworth’s , that when another man awakens the woman’s feelings more powerfully , she reproaches her husband for the false image of happiness and contentment that he has passed off on her as the real thing .
 But Hester should have made peace with this injustice long ago .
 What did her outburst mean .
 Had seven long years under the torture of the scarlet letter inflicted so much misery without moving her to repentance .
 
.
 The emotions of that brief time in which she stood staring after the crooked figure of old Roger Chillingworth shower Hester’s state of mind in a dark light , revealing a great deal that she might otherwise have denied even to herself .
 
.
 When he was gone , she summoned her child back .
 
.
 Pearl .
 Little Pearl .
 Where are you .
 
.
 Pearl , whose active spirit never tired , had amused herself while her mother talked with the old doctor .
 At first , as already described , she flirted with her own image in a pool of water , beckoning the phantom in the water to come out and play , and trying to join the girl when she saw that she would not leave her pool .
 When Pearl discovered that either she or the image was unreal , she turned elsewhere for better amusement .
 She made little boats out of birch bark , placed snail shells upon them , and sent more vessels into the mighty ocean than any merchant in New England .
 Most of them sank near the shore .
 She grabbed a horseshoe crab by the tail , collected several starfish , and laid a jellyfish out to melt in the warm sun .
 Then she took the white foam , which streaked along the advancing tide , and threw it into the breeze .
 She scampered after the foam snowflakes , trying to catch them before they fell .
 Seeing a flock of seabirds feeding and fluttering along the shore , the naughty child gathered pebbles in her apron and , creeping from rock to rock as she stalked the small birds , showed remarkable ability in hitting them .
 Pearl was almost certain that one little gray bird with a white breast had been hit by a pebble and fluttered away with a broken wing .
 But then the elflike child gave up her amusement because it saddened her to have harmed a little being that was as wild as the sea breeze , as wild as Pearl herself .
 
.
 Her final occupation was to gather seaweed of various sorts .
 She made herself a scarf and a headdress and dressed up like a little mermaid .
 She had her mother’s gift for devising drapery and costume .
 As the final touch to her mermaid costume , Pearl took some eelgrass and imitated on her bosom , as best she could , the decoration that she was so used to seeing on her mother’s .
 A letter—the letter A—but green instead of scarlet .
 The child lowered her chin to her breast and contemplated this design with great interest , as if deciphering the letter were the only thing she had been sent into the world to do .
 
.
 I wonder if mother will ask me what it means .
  thought Pearl .
 
.
 My little Pearl ,  said Hester , after a moment’s silence , the green letter on your childish breast has no meaning .
 Do you know , my child , what this letter means , which your mother is condemned to wear .
 
.
 Yes , mother ,  said the child .
 It is capital A .
 You taught me to read it in the alphabet book .
 
.
 Hester looked steadily into her little face .
 Though there was that odd expression that she so often saw in her black eyes , Hester could not decide whether Pearl really attached any meaning to the symbol .
 She felt a strange urge to settle the point .
 
.
 Do you know , child , why your mother wears this letter .
 
.
 Truly I do .
  answered Pearl , looking brightly into her mother’s face .
 It is for the same reason that the minister keeps his hand over his heart .
 
.
 I have told all that I know , mother ,  said Pearl , more seriously than she usually spoke .
 Ask that old man over there who you have been talking with .
 Maybe he knows .
 But seriously , no , mother dear , what does this scarlet letter mean .
 Why do you wear it on your bosom .
 And why does the minister keep his hand over his heart .
 
.
 Pearl’s constant curiosity about the mystery of the scarlet letter seemed an essential part of her character .
 From the time Pearl had first been aware of it , she had been on a mission to discover its meaning .
 Hester had often imagined that God had given her daughter this interest to make her an instrument of justice and punishment .
 But now Hester wondered for the first time whether there might also be a divine purpose of mercy and kindness at work .
 If Hester put her faith and trust in Pearl , treating her as both a messenger sent from Heaven and an earthly child , could it be the daughter’s purpose to soothe away the sorrow in her mother’s heart .
 Was the girl meant to help her overcome the wild passion Hester had buried in her heart .
 
.
 What does the letter mean , mother .
 And why do you wear it .
 And why does the minister keep his hand over his heart .
 
.
 What should I say .
  thought Hester to herself .
 No .
 If this is what I must pay to win the child’s friendship , the price is too high .
 
.
 The she spoke aloud .
 
.
 Silly Pearl ,  she said , what kind of questions are these .
 There are many things that a child must not ask about .
 What do I know about the minister’s heart .
 And as for the scarlet letter , I wear it for the sake of its gold thread .
 
.
 In the past seven years , Hester Prynne had never lied about the symbol on her bosom .
 Perhaps the letter was the mark of a guardian spirit—stern and severe , but yet watchful—that left her as she said this .
 Perhaps the spirit recognized that some new evil had crept into her heart despite his watchfulness , or some old evil had always lingered there .
 As for little Pearl , the seriousness soon left her face .
 
.
 Mother ,  she said , what does the scarlet letter mean .
 
.
 And the next morning , the first sign that the child was awake came when she popped her head up from her pillow and asked that other question , which she had inexplicably connected with her questions about the scarlet letter : 
.
 Mother .
 Mother .
 Why does the minister keep his hand over his heart .
 
.
 And never shall , my child , I hope ,  said Hester .
 
.
 And why not , mother .
  asked Pearl , stopping short just as she began to run off .
 Won’t that come of its own accord when I am grown into a woman .
 
.
 Run away , child ,  her mother answered , and catch the sunshine .
 It will soon be gone .
 
.
 I am not tired , mother ,  replied the little girl .
 But you may sit down , if you will tell me a story while you rest .
 
.
 A story , child .
  said Hester .
 A story about what .
 
.
 And who told you this story , Pearl .
  asked her mother , recognizing a superstition common in those days .
 
.
 It was the old woman in the chimney corner , at the sick house where you watched last night ,  said the child .
 But she thought I was asleep when she spoke of it .
 She said that thousands of people had met him here , and had written in his book , and have his mark on them .
 She said that ugly old lady , Mistress Hibbins , was one of them .
 And , mother , the old woman said that this scarlet letter was the Black Man’s mark on you , and that it glows like a red flame when you meet him at midnight , here in this dark wood .
 Is it true , mother .
 Do you go to meet him in the nighttime .
 
.
 Did you ever wake and find your mother gone .
  asked Hester .
 
.
 Not that I remember ,  said the child .
 If you’re afraid to leave me in our cottage , you might take me along with you .
 I would very gladly go .
 But mother , tell me now .
 Is there such a Black Man .
 And did you ever meet him .
 And is this his mark .
 
.
 Will you leave me alone , if I tell you once .
  asked her mother .
 
.
 Yes , if you tell me everything ,  answered Pearl .
 
.
 Once in my life I met the Black Man .
  said her mother .
 This scarlet letter is his mark .
 
.
 Oh , brook .
 Oh , foolish and tiresome little brook .
  cried Pearl , after listening awhile to its talk .
 Why are you so sad .
 Pick up your spirits , and don’t be sighing and murmuring all the time .
 
.
 What does the sad little brook say , mother .
  she asked .
 
.
 If you had a sorrow of your own , the brook might speak about it ,  answered her mother , even as it is speaking to me about mine .
 But I hear a footstep along the path , and the sound of someone pushing branches aside .
 Go play and leave me to speak with the man coming this way .
 
.
 Is it the Black Man .
  asked Pearl .
 
.
 Will you go and play , child .
  her mother repeated .
 But don’t wander far into the wood .
 And take care that you come at my first call .
 
.
 Yes , mother ,  answered Pearl .
 But if it is the Black Man , would you let me stay a moment and look at him , with his big book under his arm .
 
.
 Yes it is .
  said the child .
 And , mother , he has his hand over his heart .
 Did the Black Man make his mark there when the minister wrote his name in the book .
 And why doesn’t he wear the mark outside his chest , as you do , mother .
 
.
 Go , child , and tease me another time ,  cried Hester Prynne .
 But do not go far .
 Stay where you can hear the babble of the brook .
 
.
 To Hester’s eye , the Reverend MrDimmesdale showed no sign of active , lively suffering—except that , as little Pearl had noticed , he kept his hand over his heart .
 
.
 Though the minister walked slowly , he had almost passed before Hester Prynne could find her voice .
 But she finally did .
 
.
 Who speaks .
  answered the minister .
 
.
 He took a step closer and saw the scarlet letter .
 
.
 Hester .
 Hester Prynne .
  he said .
 Is it you .
 Are you alive .
 
.
 After a while , the minister looked into Hester Prynne’s eyes .
 
.
 Hester ,  he said , have you found peace .
 
.
 She gave a weary smile and looked down at her bosom .
 
.
 Have you .
  she asked .
 
.
 The people respect you ,  said Hester .
 And surely you do good works among them .
 Doesn’t this bring you any comfort .
 
.
 You are too hard on yourself ,  said Hester gently .
 You have deeply and seriously repented .
 You sin is long behind you .
 Your present life is no less holy than it seems in people’s eyes .
 Is there no reality in repentance confirmed by good works .
 And why shouldn’t that bring you peace .
 
.
 You have such a friend as you wished for just now ,  she said , with whom to weep over your sin .
 You have me , the partner of it .
  Again she hesitated , but said with an effort : You have long had such an enemy , and live with him , under the same roof .
 
.
 The minister leapt to his feet , gasping for breath and clutching at his heart , as though he would have ripped it out of his breast .
 
.
 Hester Prynne was now fully aware of the deep injury that she was responsible for giving to this man , having permitted him to lie for so many years—or even for one minute—at the mercy of the malevolent doctor .
 The closeness of his enemy , no matter how well concealed , was enough to disturb a spirit as sensitive as Arthur Dimmesdale .
 There had been a time when Hester was less aware of this .
 Perhaps her own troubles hardened her to all others , and so she left the minister to bear what she could imagine as a more tolerable fate .
 But recently , since that night on the platform , her feelings toward him had been both softened and heightened .
 She now read his heart more accurately .
 She did not doubt that Roger Chillingworth had taken advantage of the minister’s circumstances cruelly , infecting the very air around the minister with his evil influence and exploiting his authority as a physician to meddle with the minister’s health .
 He had kept the minister’s conscience in a perpetually irritated state , which corrupted his spirit rather than curing it through wholesome pain .
 The result in this life could only be to drive the minister insane and , in the afterlife , to permanently separate him from the Good and True—insanity being essentially the same thing as damnation .
 
.
 This was the condition to which she had reduced the man whom she once—well , why not say it .
 —whom she still loved so passionately .
 Hester believed that the sacrifice of the clergyman’s reputation , and even his life itself , would have been better than the alternative she had taken it upon herself to choose .
 Rather than having to confess such a terrible wrong , she would gladly have lain down on the forest leaves and died at Arthur Dimmesdale’s feet .
 
.
 You will forgive me .
  cried Hester , throwing herself in the fallen leaves beside him .
 Let God punish .
 You will forgive .
 
.
 With a sudden and desperate tenderness , she threw her arms around him and pressed his head against her breast .
 She did not care that his cheek rested on the scarlet letter .
 He would have freed himself , but he could not .
 Hester would not set him free , lest he look at her with reproach .
 All the world had frowned at her—for seven long years it had frowned at this lonely woman—and she bore it all , never turning away her firm , sad eyes .
 Heaven had frowned at her , too , and she had not died .
 But the frown of this pale , weak , sinful , and sorrowful man was more than Hester could bear .
 
.
 Will you forgive me yet .
  she repeated , over and over again .
 Will you not frown .
 Will you forgive .
 
.
 Never , never .
  she whispered .
 What we did had a holiness of its own .
 We felt that .
 We told each other so .
 Have you forgotten that .
 
.
 And yet they lingered .
 The forest path back to the settlement looked dreary : There Hester Prynne would once again take up the burden of her shame , and the minister the hollow mockery of his reputation .
 So they lingered another moment .
 No golden light was ever so precious as the gloom of this dark forest .
 Here , seen only by his eyes , the scarlet letter did not burn the bosom of the sinful woman .
 Here , seen only by her eyes , Arthur Dimmesdale—false to God and to man—might , for one moment , be true .
 
.
 He started suddenly as a thought occurred to him .
 
.
 You must live with this man no longer ,  said Hester , slowly and firmly .
 Your heart must be no longer under his evil eye .
 
.
 That would be worse than death .
  replied the minister .
 But how can I avoid it .
 What choice do I have left .
 Should I lie down again on these withered leaves , where I threw myself when you told me who he was .
 Must I fall down there and die at once .
 
.
 Oh , what have you come to .
  said Hester , with tears filling her eyes .
 Will you die of weakness .
 There is no other reason .
 
.
 The judgment of God is upon me ,  answered the guilty priest .
 It is too strong for me to resist .
 
.
 Heaven would be merciful ,  replied Hester , if you had the strength to ask for mercy .
 
.
 Be strong for me .
  he answered .
 Advise me what to do .
 
.
 Is the world that small .
  exclaimed Hester Prynne , looking at the minister with her deep eyes .
 Instinctively , she exercised her power over a spirit so broken and beaten down that it could hardly hold itself upright .
 Is that town , which not that long ago was just part of the forest , the entire universe .
 Where does this forest path go .
 Back to the settlement , you say .
 Yes , but it goes onward too .
 It goes deeper and deeper into the wilderness , less visible with every step .
 A few miles from here , the yellow leaves show no trace of the white man’s tracks .
 There you would be free .
 Such a brief journey would take you from a world where you have been miserable to one where you might still be happy .
 Isn’t there enough shade in this vast forest to hide your heart from the gaze of Roger Chillingworth .
 
.
 It cannot be .
  answered the minister , listening as though he were being encouraged to realize a dream .
 I do not have the power to go .
 Miserable and sinful as I am , I have no desire to do anything but continue my earthly life where I have been placed .
 Although my own soul is lost , I would still do what I can for other souls .
 Though I am an unfaithful watchman , sure to be rewarded with death and dishonor when my dreary watch comes to an end , yet I dare not quit my post .
 
.
 It was the last expression of the despair of a broken spirit .
 He lacked the energy to grab onto the better fortune that seemed within his reach .
 
.
 Alone , Hester .
 
.
 You will not go alone .
  she answered , in a deep whisper .
 
.
 And when she’d said that , she’d said everything there was to say .
 
.
 Arthur Dimmesdale gazed into Hester’s face with a look of hope and joy—yet there was fear and a kind of shock at her boldness in speaking what he had hinted at but did not dare to say .
 
.
 But Hester Prynne had a naturally active and courageous mind .
 She had been outlawed from society for so long that she had become used to a freedom of thought that was altogether foreign to the clergyman .
 She had wandered in a moral wilderness , without rule or guidance—a wilderness as vast , dark , and complex as the untamed forest in which they were now together .
 Her mind and heart were at home in uninhabited places , where she roamed as freely as the wild Indian in his woods .
 For many years now she had looked at human institutions from this isolated point of view .
 She criticized it all with almost as little reverence as an Indian would feel for the ministry or the judiciary , the many forms of ritual punishment , the fireside around which families gathered , or the church in which they prayed .
 Her fate had set her free from all .
 The scarlet letter was her passport into regions where other women dared not go .
 Shame , despair , and solitude had been her stern and wild teachers .
 They had made her strong , but they had often guided her poorly .
 
.
 The minister , on the other hand , had never experienced anything to lead him beyond the scope of social authority—though he had once violated that authority quite gravely .
 But that had been a sin of passion , not a matter of choosing the wrong principle to follow or even of making a deliberate choice at all .
 Since that awful time , he had kept an obsessively close watch not only over his acts—for those were easy to control—but over each emotion and passing thought he experienced .
 In those days , the clergyman stood at the head of the social system .
 And so MrDimmesdale was all the more trodden down by society’s regulations , its principles , and even its prejudices .
 As a priest , the framework of order inevitably constrained him .
 As a man who had once sinned , and then kept his conscience alive and painfully sensitive by worrying over the unhealed spiritual wound , it might be the case the he was less likely to step out of line than if he had never sinned at all .
 
.
 If there was a struggle in the clergyman’s soul , it need not be described .
 Suffice it to say that he resolved to flee—and not alone .
 
.
 You will go .
  said Hester calmly , as he looked her in the eyes .
 
.
 Is this joy I feel once again .
  he cried , amazed at himself .
 I thought that there was no joy left in me .
 Oh , Hester , you are my better angel .
 I have thrown myself—sick , sinful , and miserable—down on these forest leaves , and I have been made new , with no powers to glorify God , who has been merciful .
 I have already reached a better life .
 Why didn’t we find it sooner .
 
.
 Let’s not look back now ,  answered Hester Prynne .
 The past is gone .
 Why should we linger over it now .
 Look .
 With this symbol I undo everything and make it as though it had never been .
 
.
 Do you think she will be glad to meet me .
  asked the minister , somewhat uneasily .
 I usually avoid children because they seem not to trust me .
 I have even been afraid of little Pearl .
 
.
 I see her ,  the minister said .
 She’s over there , standing in the sunbeams—a way off on the other side of the brook .
 So you think that she will love me .
 
.
 You will love her fondly ,  repeated Hester Prynne , as she and the minister sat watching little Pearl .
 Isn’t she beautiful .
 And look how she has adorned herself with such simple flowers .
 If she had gathered pearls , diamonds , and rubies instead , they could not have suited her better .
 She is a wonderful child .
 But I know whose forehead she has .
 
.
 Do you know , Hester ,  said Arthur Dimmesdale , with an uneasy smile , that this dear child , who is always at your side , has often alarmed me .
 I thought—oh , Hester , it is awful to dread such a thought .
 —that I could see my own features in her face , so clearly that the whole world would see them .
 But she is mostly yours .
 
.
 No , no .
 Not mostly .
  answered Hester , with a tender smile .
 A little longer and you won’t need to be afraid that others will learn whose child she is .
 She looks so strangely beautiful with those wild flowers in her hair .
 It’s as if one of the fairies , whom we left behind in England , had dressed her to meet us .
 
.
 Don’t let her see anything strange in your approach : no passion or overeagerness ,  whispered Hester .
 Our Pearl is a flighty little elf sometimes .
 She doesn’t usually tolerate emotion when she doesn’t understand why it has arisen .
 But she has strong emotions .
 She loves me and will love you .
 
.
 You cannot imagine ,  said the minister , glancing at Hester Prynne , how my heart dreads this interview and how it desires it .
 But as I’ve already told you , children don’t often like me .
 They will not sit in my lap , nor whisper in my ear , nor answer my smile .
 They stand far off and look at me strangely .
 Even little babies weep bitterly when I hold them .
 Yet Pearl , twice already , has been kind to me .
 The first time you remember well .
 The second was when you led her to the house of that stern old Governor .
 
.
 I have a strange notion ,  said the observant minister , that this brook is the border between two worlds and that you will never meet your Pearl again .
 Or is she an elflike spirit .
 Our childhood tales taught us that elves are forbidden to cross a running stream .
 Tell her to hurry—this delay has already given a tremble to my nerves .
 
.
 Come , dear child .
  Hester encouraged her , stretching out both arms .
 You are so slow .
 When have you moved as slowly as this .
 There is a friend of mine here , who must be your friend as well .
 From now on , you will have twice as much love as I could give you alone .
 Leap across the brook and come to us .
 You can leap like a young deer .
 
.
 Pearl still pointed , and a frown took shape on her brow .
 It was all the more impressive for the childish , almost babylike face that conveyed it .
 Her mother kept beckoning to her , with a face full of unusual smiles .
 The child stamped her foot with an even more demanding look and gesture .
 The brook reflected the fantastic beauty of the image , giving the frown and pointed finger and demanding gesture even greater emphasis .
 
.
 Hurry , Pearl , or I will be angry with you .
  cried Hester Prynne .
 Though she was accustomed to the behavior of her elflike child , she was naturally anxious for her to act differently just now .
 Leap across the brook , naughty child , and run over here .
 Otherwise I will cross over to you .
 
.
 The child looked where her mother had indicated .
 The scarlet letter lay there , so close to the edge of the stream that the gold embroidery was reflected in the water .
 
.
 Bring it here .
  said Hester .
 
.
 You come here and pick it up .
  replied Pearl .
 
.
 Was there ever a child like this .
  Hester asked the minister .
 I have so much to tell you about her .
 But she is right about this hateful symbol .
 I must bear its torture a little longer—but only a few days longer .
 When we have left this region , we will look back on it as though it were a dream .
 The forest cannot hide the scarlet letter , but the ocean will take it from my hand and swallow it up forever .
 
.
 When the change was complete , she extended her hand to Pearl .
 
.
 In a tender mood that was unusual for her , she lowered her mother’s head and kissed her forehead and both cheeks .
 But then—as though the child needed to mix a throb of pain into any comfort she might give—Pearl kissed the scarlet letter too .
 
.
 That was not nice .
  said Hester .
 When you have shown me a little love , you mock me .
 
.
 Why is the minister sitting over there .
  asked Pearl .
 
.
 Does he love us .
  asked Pearl , looking into her mother’s face with a sharp intelligence .
 Will he go back into the town with us , hand in hand .
 
.
 Will he always keep his hand over his heart .
  asked Pearl .
 
.
 Silly child , what kind of question is that .
  exclaimed her mother .
 Come here and ask his blessing .
 
.
 So , reverend sir , you have visited the forest ,  observed the witch-lady , nodding her high headdress at him .
 The next time you go , let me know and I will be proud to keep you company .
 I don’t mean to brag , but a good word from me will help you get in good with that powerful man of whom you know .
 
.
 She walked off with the stateliness of her age , but often looked back and smiled at him , like one who acknowledges a secret , intimate connection .
 
.
 So have I sold myself ,  thought the minister , to the Devil who they say this old woman has chosen for her lord and master .
 
.
 The miserable minister .
 He had made a very similar bargain .
 Tempted by a dream of happiness , he had deliberately given in to deadly sin , as he had never done before .
 And the poison of that sin had rapidly infected his entire moral system .
 It had deadened all of his holy impulses and awakened a whole host of bad ones .
 He was tempted and frightened by scorn , bitterness , malice , and a desire to ridicule everything good and holy .
 And his encounter with old Mistress Hibbins—if it happened in the first place—showed his sympathy and friendship with wicked mortals and the world of strange spirits .
 
.
 There on the table , with the pen beside it , was an unfinished sermon .
 He had stopped writing it two days ago , when his thoughts had broken off in the middle of a sentence .
 He knew that he himself , the thin and white-cheeked minister , who had done and suffered these things , and had written this much of the Election Sermon .
 But he seemed to stand apart from this former self , looking at him with a mix of scornful pity and half-envious curiosity .
 That old self was gone .
 Another man had returned from the forest , a wiser one .
 This new man had knowledge of hidden mysteries his former , simpler self could never have understood .
 It was truly a bitter knowledge .
 
.
 No , I don’t think so ,  replied the Reverend MrDimmesdale .
 My journey , my conversation with the holy Apostle , and the fresh air have all done me good , after being cooped up in my study for so long .
 I don’t think I’ll need any more of your drugs , my kind doctor , though they are good indeed—and dispensed by a friendly hand .
 
.
 All the while , Roger Chillingworth looked at the minister with the serious intensity of a physician examining his patient .
 But in spite of this show , the minister was nearly certain that the old man knew—or at least strongly suspected—that he had spoken with Hester Prynne .
 The doctor knew that the minister no longer thought of him as a trusted friend but rather as a bitter enemy .
 It would seem natural that they’d talk about this change .
 But it’s one of those interesting things—a long time can pass before you say aloud what you’re both thinking .
 Two people who choose to avoid a certain subject may approach the very edge of it and then veer away .
 And so the minister was not concerned that Roger Chillingworth would say anything to hint at their real relationship to one another .
 Yet the doctor , in his dark way , came dreadfully close to the secret .
 
.
 Yes , to another world ,  the minister replied with pious resignation .
 May Heaven make it a better one .
 Truly , I don’t expect that I will remain with my parishioners for another year .
 But , as for your medicine , kind sir , at the moment I do not need it .
 
.
 It brings me joy to hear it ,  replied the doctor .
 Perhaps my remedies , which seemed to be in vain , have finally begun to take effect .
 I would be a happy man , and well deserving of New England’s gratitude , if I could cure you .
 
.
 Thanks from the bottom of my heart , my watchful friend ,  said the Reverend MrDimmesdale with a solemn smile .
 I thank you and can only repay your good deeds with my prayers .
 
.
 A good man’s prayers are golden payment .
  replied old Roger Chillingworth , as he took his leave .
 Yes , they are the true currency of Heaven , with God’s own stamp on them .
 
.
 On the morning of the new Governor’s inauguration , Hester Prynne and little Pearl entered the marketplace .
 It was already full of craftsmen and other common townspeople .
 There were a great many of them and many rougher figures too : people wearing the deerskin garments common in the forest settlements that surrounded the town .
 
.
 Perhaps , on this day , there was an expression on Hester’s face that hadn’t been seen there before .
 It was too subtle to be detected—unless a psychic could have read Hester’s heart , then looked for a similar feeling in her face .
 Such a psychic might have sensed that Hester had endured the gaze of the crowd for several miserable years because she had to , because it was a penance , and because her religion demanded it—and now she was enduring it freely and voluntarily , for one last time .
 She was converting what had been an agony into a kind of triumph .
 Take your last look at the scarlet letter and its wearer .
  Hester , the public’s victim and slave might say .
 Just a little longer , and she will be beyond your reach .
 A few more hours and the deep , mysterious ocean will drown the symbol you have made to burn on her bosom .
  And it would not be inconsistent with human nature to suppose that Hester felt some regret , too , at the very moment when she was about to be freed from the pain that had become such a part of her .
 She might feel a great desire to draw a last , long drink from the bitter cup that had flavored all the years of her adulthood .
 The wine of life she would drink from now on would be rich , delicious , and thrilling—or else leave her weary , after the intensity of the bitter drink she had drunk for so long .
 
.
 He remembers you as a little baby , my child ,  answered Hester .
 
.
 They are waiting to see the procession ,  said Hester .
 The Governor and the magistrates will pass by , and the ministers and all the great people and good people , with the band and the soldiers marching ahead of them .
 
.
 And will the minister be there .
  asked Pearl .
 And will he hold out his hands to me , as he did when you led me to him in the forest .
 
.
 The scene was as Hester described it : The faces of the people were unusually bright and jolly .
 The Puritans compressed the small amount of permitted joy and happiness into the holiday season , which this was .
 On those days , the usual cloud was so completely dispelled that for one day the Puritans seemed no more serious than a normal community faced with a plague .
 
.
 And then again , perhaps I’m exaggerating the darkness of the moods and manners of the day .
 The people who filled Boston’s marketplace were not born to inherit the Puritan gloom .
 They were native Englishmen , whose fathers had lived in the sunny richness of Queen Elizabeth’s reign .
 At that time , the life of England , viewed as a whole , seems to have been as grand , magnificent , and joyous as anything the world has ever witnessed .
 Had they followed in the steps of their ancestors , the New England settlers would have celebrated all events of public importance with bonfires , banquets , pageants , and processions .
 And it would have been possible , in performing these ceremonies , to combine joyful play with solemnity and give an eccentric , brilliant embroidery to the great robe of state that a nation puts on at such festivals .
 There was a hint of an attempt at this playfulness in the celebration of political inaugurations .
 A dim reflection of a half-remembered splendor , a gray and diluted version of what these settlers had seen in proud old London , could be observed in our forefathers’ celebration of the annual installation of magistrates .
 The leaders of the community—politician , priest , and soldier—felt it was their duty to put on the older style of dress .
 They all moved in a procession before the eyes of the people , giving a needed dignity to a government so recently formed .
 
.
 What do you mean .
  asked Hester , more startled than she allowed herself to show .
 Do you have another passenger .
 
.
 Don’t you know ,  cried the ship’s captain , that this doctor here—he calls himself Chillingworth—has decided to try ship’s cooking along with you .
 Yeah , sure , you must have known .
 He tells me that he is a member of your party and a close friend of the gentleman you spoke of—the one that is in danger from these sour old Puritans .
 
.
 They do know each other well ,  replied Hester , maintaining the appearance of calmness despite her great distress .
 They have lived together for a long time .
 
.
 The sailor and Hester Prynne spoke nothing more .
 But at that moment she saw old Roger Chillingworth himself , standing in the farthest corner of the marketplace and smiling at her .
 Even across the broad and busy square , through all the talk and laughter and various thoughts , moods , and interests of the crowd , that smile conveyed a secret and fearful meaning .
 
.
 Before Hester could gather her thoughts and consider what she ought to do with this new and startling information , the sound of military music approached along a nearby street .
 It signaled the procession of magistrates and citizens on its way toward the meetinghouse .
 According to a custom established early and observed ever since , the Reverend MrDimmesdale would there deliver an Election Sermon .
 
.
 Following the magistrates came the young , distinguished minister expected to give a sermon that day .
 In that era , clergymen displayed more intellectual ability than politicians .
 Putting spiritual motivations aside , the ministry offered to an ambitious man many attractive incentives , notably the almost worshipping respect of the community .
 Even political power was within the grasp of a successful minister .
 
.
 Mother ,  she said , was that the same minister who kissed me by the brook .
 
.
 What would you expect him to say , Pearl ,  answered Hester , except that it wasn’t the proper time or place to kiss .
 Foolish child , it’s a good thing you didn’t speak to him .
 
.
 Ma’am , I don’t know what you’re talking about ,  answered Hester Prynne , sensing that Mistress Hibbins was not in her right mind .
 Nonetheless , Hester was strangely affected by the bold manner with which she discussed the personal connection between so many people—herself included—and the Devil .
 It is not my place to speak lightly of the wise and devout Reverend Dimmesdale .
 
.
 What is it , Mistress Hibbins .
  asked little Pearl eagerly .
 Have you seen it .
 
.
 It doesn’t matter , darling .
  answered Mistress Hibbins , bowing deeply to Pearl .
 You will see it for yourself eventually .
 You know , child , they say that you are descended from the Prince of Air .
 Will you ride with me some lovely night to see your father .
 Then you will know why the minister keeps his hand over his heart .
 
.
 The strange woman left , laughing with such a shrill sound that the entire marketplace could hear her .
 
.
 All this while , Hester stood like a statute at the base of the platform .
 She would have been drawn to this spot where she spent the first hour of her public shame , even if the minister’s voice had not held her there .
 She had a sense—not clear enough to be a thought , but still weighing heavily on her mind—that her entire life was connected to this one spot , the one unifying point .
 
.
 Meanwhile , little Pearl had left her mother’s side and gone off to play in the marketplace .
 She cheered up the serious crowd with the odd , glistening light of her presence , just as a brightly colored bird lights up a dark tree by darting back and forth among the darkly clustered leaves .
 She moved in a constantly changing , sometimes sharp manner that expressed the restless liveliness of her spirit .
 Never satisfied with the predictable or conventional , her spirit today was doubly excited by her mother’s uneasiness , which it sensed and responded to .
 Whenever a person or thing drew Pearl’s wandering curiosity , she flew straight to it and seized upon it as though it were her own .
 Yet she always maintained her freedom of movement .
 She was never possessed by what she sought to possess .
 The Puritans watched her .
 Even the ones who smiled at her were quite willing to believe that she was likely the child of a demon , judging by the strange , eccentric beauty that sparkled throughout her .
 She ran and stared into the face of the wild Indian , and he recognized a spirit more wild than his own .
 Then , with both audacity and a characteristic reserve , she flew into the middle of a group of sailors .
 The red-faced wild men of the ocean gazed at Pearl with wonder and amazement , as though a flake of sea foam had assumed the shape of a girl but retained the soul of the fire that sailors see in the deep water at night .
 
.
 Your mother is that woman with the scarlet letter ,  said the sailor .
 Will you deliver a message to her from me .
 
.
 If I like the message ,  answered Pearl .
 
.
 While Hester stood in that magic circle of shame , where the clever cruelty of her sentence seemed destined to last forever , the admired minister was looking down from the sacred pulpit at the audience , whose innermost spirit had submitted to his control .
 The sainted minister in church .
 The woman of the scarlet letter in the marketplace .
 Who would have imagined that the same burning mark was on them both .
 
.
 Once in the open air , the crowd burst into speech , filling the street and the marketplace with their praise of the minister .
 They could not rest until they had told each other about what had happened , which everyone already knew better than anyone could say .
 They all agreed that no one had ever spoken with such wisdom and great holiness as their minister had that day .
 Inspiration , they felt , had never filled human speech as much as it had filled his .
 It was as though the Holy Spirit had descended upon him , possessed him , and lifted him above the words written on the page .
 It filled him with ideas that must have been as marvelous to him as they were to his audience .
 His subject had been the relationship between God and human communities , with especial attention paid to the communities of New England founded in the wilderness .
 As he drew toward his conclusion , something like a prophetic spirit had come to him , bending him to its purpose just as it had used the old prophets of Israel .
 Only the Jewish prophets had predicted judgment and ruin for their country , but their minister spoke of the glorious destiny awaiting the newly gathered community of God .
 Yet throughout the whole sermon , there had been an undertone of deep sadness .
 It could only be interpreted as the natural regret of a man about to die .
 Yes , their minister , whom they loved so dearly—and who loved them so much that he could not depart for Heaven without a sigh—sensed that his death was approaching and that he would soon leave them in tears .
 The idea that the minister’s time on earth would be short made the sermon’s effect even stronger .
 It was as though an angel on his way to Heaven had shaken his bright wings over the people for a moment , sending a shower of golden truths down upon them .
 
.
 And so there had come to the Reverend MrDimmesdale—as there comes to most men , though they seldom recognize it until too late—a period of life more brilliant and full of triumph than any that had come before or would come after .
 At this moment he stood at the highest peak to which intellect , eloquence , and purity could elevate a clergyman in the early days of New England , when the profession of minister was already a lofty pedestal .
 This was the minister’s position , as he bowed his head forward on the pulpit at the end of his Election Sermon .
 And meanwhile Hester Prynne was standing beside the scaffold of the pillory with the scarlet letter still burning on her breast .
 
.
 The sound of the band was heard again , as were the rhythmic steps of the militia members as they walked out from the church door .
 The procession was to march from there to the town hall , where a great banquet would complete the day’s ceremonies .
 
.
 So what did he make of it .
 Wasn’t there a sparkling halo floating above his head .
 Being so filled with spirit , and held up so high by his worshippers , did his footsteps really fall upon the dust of the earth .
 
.
 As the military men and civic leaders moved past , all eyes turned toward the point where the minister could be seen drawing near .
 The shouts quieted to a murmur as one part of the crowd and then another caught a glimpse of him .
 How weak and pale he looked even in his triumph .
 The energy—or rather , the inspiration that had held him up to deliver the sacred message—had vanished now that it had performed it’s mission .
 The fire that had glowed on his cheek was extinguished like a flame that sinks down into the dying embers .
 His face hardly seemed to belong to a living man—its color was so deathly .
 It was hardly a man with life in him who wobbled along his path—wobbled , but did not fall .
 
.
 Bellingham had kept an anxious eye upon him for the last few moments .
 Now he left his own place in the procession to give assistance .
 From MrDimmesdale’s appearance , it seemed certain that he would fall .
 But there was something in the minister’s expression that warned Bellingham to stay back , though he was not the sort of man to follow ambiguous signs .
 The crowd , meanwhile , looked on with awe and wonder .
 This mortal weakness was , in their eyes , just another indication of the minister’s heavenly strength .
 It would not have seemed too great a miracle for one so holy to ascend right before their eyes , growing dimmer and yet brighter as he finally faded into the light of Heaven .
 
.
 He turned toward the platform and extended his arms .
 
.
 Hester ,  he said , come here .
 Come , my little Pearl .
 
.
 He gave them a ghastly look , but there was something both tender and strangely triumphant to it .
 The child , with her birdlike motion , flew to him and clasped her arms around his knees .
 Hester Prynne—slowly , as if moved against her will by an inevitable fate—also drew near , but paused before she reached him .
 At that moment old Roger Chillingworth broke through the crowd to stop his victim from what he was about to do .
 Or , perhaps , looking as dark , disturbed , and evil as he did , Chillingworth rose up from some corner of Hell .
 Whatever the case , the old man rushed forward and grabbed the minister by the arm .
 
.
 Ha , tempter .
 I think you are too late .
  answered the minister , looking him in the eye fearfully but firmly .
 Your power is not as strong as it was .
 With God’s help , I will escape you now .
 
.
 Again he extended his hand to the woman with the scarlet letter .
 
.
 Even if you had searched the whole world ,  he said , looking at the clergyman with malice , there was no place so secret , high or low , where you could have escaped me—except on this very platform .
 
.
 Thanks be to Him who has led me here .
  replied the minister .
 
.
 Yet he trembled and looked to Hester with doubt and anxiety in his eyes , though there was a feeble smile upon his lips .
 
.
 Isn’t this better ,  he murmured , than what we dreamed of in the forest .
 
.
 Partly supported by Hester Prynne and holding little Pearl’s hand , the Reverend MrDimmesdale turned to the community leaders , the fellow holy ministers , and the people .
 Deep down , the people were both shocked and truly sympathetic , sensing that some profound aspect of life—full of sin , but also full of repentance—was about to be revealed .
 The sun , a little past its highest point , shone down upon the minister , making his form distinct .
 He stood apart from all the earth , ready to plead guilty before the court of eternal justice .
 
.
 It seemed , at this point , as though the minister would not live to reveal the rest of his secret .
 But he fought off the weak body and faint heart that was struggling to master him .
 He shook off all assistance and passionately stepped forward from the woman and their daughter .
 
.
 With a spasm , he tore his minister’s robe away from his breast .
 It was revealed .
 But it would be pointless to describe that revelation .
 For an instant , the eyes of the horrified mass were focused on the dreadful miracle .
 The minister stood with a flush of triumph in his face , as though he had persevered in the midst of a great torment .
 Then he crumpled upon the platform .
 Hester raised him slightly , supporting his head against her bosom .
 Old Roger Chillingworth kneeled down next to him , his face blank and dull , as though the life had drained out of it .
 
.
 You have escaped me .
  he said over and over .
 You have escaped me .
 
.
 May God forgive you .
  said the minister .
 You have sinned deeply too .
 
.
 His dying eyes turned away from the old man and looked instead at the woman and child .
 
.
 Hester ,  said the clergyman , goodbye .
 
.
 Won’t we meet again .
  she whispered , bending her face down close to his .
 Won’t we spend eternity together .
 Surely , surely , we have saved each other through all this misery .
 You see far into eternity now , with those bright dying eyes .
 Tell me what you see .
 
.
 After several days , when enough time had passed for people to gather their thoughts , there was more than one account of what they had seen on the platform .
 
.
 But leaving this discussion aside , there are some final details to communicate .
 Old Roger Chillingworth died less than a year after MrDimmesdale , and he left a great deal of property , both in Boston and in England , to little Pearl , the daughter of Hester Prynne .
 
.
 Hester Prynne had returned to take up her long-abandoned shame .
 But where was little Pearl .
 If she were still alive , she must have been in the prime of her young womanhood by now .
 No one knew , nor ever learned for sure , whether the child had died young or whether her wild , extravagant nature had mellowed into a woman’s gentle happiness .
 But for the rest of Hester’s life , there was evidence that someone in a faraway land cared for the aging woman .
 She received letters affixed with seals of nobility , though not the familiar English seals .
 Luxurious items decorated her cottage , though Hester never used them .
 The gifts were expensive , though thoughtful too .
 And there were trinkets , pretty little things that must have been made for Hester by nimble fingers moved by a loving heart .
 And once Hester was seen making a baby’s dress with embroidery so lavish , it would have raised a public outcry if an infant in her community had worn them .
 
.
 But there was more of a life for Hester Prynne here in New England than in that far-off land where Pearl lived .
 Hester’s sin had been here , her sorrow was here , and her penance would be here .
 So she had returned and freely assumed—for no public official would have dared to impose it—the symbol at the heart of this sad story .
 It never left her bosom again .
 But , in the passage of the hard working , considerate , devoted years that made up the remainder of Hester’s life , the scarlet letter ceased to be an object of regret .
 Instead , it was looked at with awe and reverence .
 Hester Prynne had no selfish desires , since she did not live in any way for her own benefit and enjoyment .
 And so people brought their troubles to her , this woman who had suffered so much herself .
 Women in particular—those either wrestling with the constant trials of their passions or bearing the burden of an unloved and therefore unloving heart—came to Hester’s cottage to ask why they were so miserable and what they could do about it .
 Hester comforted and counseled them as best she could .
 And she assured them of her firm belief that , at some better time to come , Heaven would reveal a new order in which men and women acted for their mutual happiness .
 Earlier in her life , Hester had imagined that she might be the prophetess of such a new world .
 But for a long time now , she had recognized that no mission of divine and mysterious truth would be given to a woman stained with sin , bowed with shame , and burdened with a life-long sorrow .
 The herald of the revelation to come would certainly be a woman , but one who is pure , beautiful , and noble , whose wisdom springs from joy rather than grief .
 It would be a woman whose successful life could demonstrate to others how sacred love can make us happy .

 On a field of black , the letter A in scarlet .
