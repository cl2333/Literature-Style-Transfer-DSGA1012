Advancing his hand by little and little , he took it up and looked at it .
 In the midst of the action he went astray , and , with another deep sigh , fell to work at his shoemaking .
 He took her hair into his hand again , and looked closely at it .
 It is the same .
 How can it be .
 When was it .
 How was it .
 As the concentrated expression returned to his forehead , he seemed to become conscious that it was in hers too .
 He turned her full to the light , and looked at her .
 He formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it .
 But when he did find spoken words for it , they came to him coherently , though slowly .
 How was this .
 WAS IT YOU .
 Hark .
 he exclaimed .
 Whose voice was that .
 No , no , no .
 you are too young , too blooming .
 It can't be .
 See what the prisoner is .
 These are not the hands she knew , this is not the face she knew , this is not a voice she ever heard .
 No , no .
 She wasand He wasbefore the slow years of the North Towerages ago .
 What is your name , my gentle angel .
 Hailing his softened tone and manner , his daughter fell upon her knees before him , with her appealing hands upon his breast .
 His cold white head mingled with her radiant hair , which warmed and lighted it as though it were the light of Freedom shining on him .
 If you hear in my voiceI don't know that it is so , but I hope it isif you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was sweet music in your ears , weep for it , weep for it .
 If you touch , in touching my hair , anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your breast when you were young and free , weep for it , weep for it .
 If , when I hint to you of a Home that is before us , where I will be true to you with all my duty and with all my faithful service , I bring back the remembrance of a Home long desolate , while your poor heart pined away , weep for it , weep for it .
 She held him closer round the neck , and rocked him on her breast like a child .
 If , when I tell you , dearest dear , that your agony is over , and that I have come here to take you from it , and that we go to England to be at peace and at rest , I cause you to think of your useful life laid waste , and of our native France so wicked to you , weep for it , weep for it .
 And if , when I shall tell you of my name , and of my father who is living , and of my mother who is dead , you learn that I have to kneel to my honoured father , and implore his pardon for having never for his sake striven all day and lain awake and wept all night , because the love of my poor mother hid his torture from me , weep for it , weep for it .
 Weep for her , then , and for me .
 Good gentlemen , thank God .
 I feel his sacred tears upon my face , and his sobs strike against my heart .
 O , see .
 Thank God for us , thank God .
 More fit for that , I think , than to remain in this city , so dreadful to him .
 That's business , said MrLorry , resuming on the shortest notice his methodical manners .
 and if business is to be done , I had better do it .
 Then , as the darkness closed in , the daughter laid her head down on the hard ground close at the father's side , and watched him .
 The darkness deepened and deepened , and they both lay quiet , until a light gleamed through the chinks in the wall .
 In the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion , he ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink , and put on the cloak and other wrappings , that they gave him to wear .
 He readily responded to his daughter's drawing her arm through his , and tookand kepther hand in both his own .
 You remember the place , my father .
 You remember coming up here .
 What did you say .
 But , before she could repeat the question , he murmured an answer as if she had repeated it .
 Remember .
 No , I don't remember .
 It was so very long ago .
 Defarge got upon the box , and gave the word To the Barrier .
 The postilion cracked his whip , and they clattered away under the feeble over-swinging lamps .
 I hope you care to be recalled to life .
 And the old answer : 
 I can't say .
 The end of the first book .
 Tellson's Bank by Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place , even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty .
 It was very small , very dark , very ugly , very incommodious .
 It was an old-fashioned place , moreover , in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were proud of its smallness , proud of its darkness , proud of its ugliness , proud of its incommodiousness .
 They were even boastful of its eminence in those particulars , and were fired by an express conviction that , if it were less objectionable , it would be less respectable .
 This was no passive belief , but an active weapon which they flashed at more convenient places of business .
 Tellson's they said wanted no elbow-room , Tellson's wanted no light , Tellson's wanted no embellishment .
 Noakes and Co .
 's might , or Snooks Brothers' might .
 but Tellson's , thank Heaven .
 Any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the question of rebuilding Tellson's .
 In this respect the House was much on a par with the Country .
 which did very often disinherit its sons for suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly objectionable , but were only the more respectable .
 Cramped in all kinds of dun cupboards and hutches at Tellson's , the oldest of men carried on the business gravely .
 When they took a young man into Tellson's London house , they hid him somewhere till he was old .
 They kept him in a dark place , like a cheese , until he had the full Tellson flavour and blue-mould upon him .
 Then only was he permitted to be seen , spectacularly poring over large books , and casting his breeches and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment .
 MrCruncher's apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood , and were but two in number , even if a closet with a single pane of glass in it might be counted as one .
 But they were very decently kept .
 Early as it was , on the windy March morning , the room in which he lay abed was already scrubbed throughout .
 and between the cups and saucers arranged for breakfast , and the lumbering deal table , a very clean white cloth was spread .
 MrCruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane , like a Harlequin at home .
 At fast , he slept heavily , but , by degrees , began to roll and surge in bed , until he rose above the surface , with his spiky hair looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons .
 At which juncture , he exclaimed , in a voice of dire exasperation : 
 Bust me , if she ain't at it agin .
 A woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her knees in a corner , with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she was the person referred to .
 What .
 said MrCruncher , looking out of bed for a boot .
 You're at it agin , are you .
 I was only saying my prayers .
 Saying your prayers .
 You're a nice woman .
 What do you mean by flopping yourself down and praying agin me .
 I was not praying against you .
 I was praying for you .
 They only come from the heart , Jerry .
 They are worth no more than that .
 Growling , in addition , such phrases as Ah .
 yes .
 You're religious , too .
 You wouldn't put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband and child , would you .
 Not you .
 and throwing off other sarcastic sparks from the whirling grindstone of his indignation , MrCruncher betook himself to his boot-cleaning and his general preparation for business .
 In the meantime , his son , whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes , and whose young eyes stood close by one another , as his father's did , kept the required watch upon his mother .
 He greatly disturbed that poor woman at intervals , by darting out of his sleeping closet , where he made his toilet , with a suppressed cry of You are going to flop , mother .
 Halloa , father .
 and , after raising this fictitious alarm , darting in again with an undutiful grin .
 MrCruncher's temper was not at all improved when he came to his breakfast .
 He resented MrsCruncher's saying grace with particular animosity .
 His wife explained that she had merely asked a blessing .
 Don't do it .
 said MrCruncher looking about , as if he rather expected to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his wife's petitions .
 I ain't a going to be blest out of house and home .
 I won't have my wittles blest off my table .
 Keep still .
 Exceedingly red-eyed and grim , as if he had been up all night at a party which had taken anything but a convivial turn , Jerry Cruncher worried his breakfast rather than ate it , growling over it like any four-footed inmate of a menagerie .
 Towards nine o'clock he smoothed his ruffled aspect , and , presenting as respectable and business-like an exterior as he could overlay his natural self with , issued forth to the occupation of the day .
 The head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to Tellson's establishment was put through the door , and the word was given : 
 Porter wanted .
 Hooray , father .
 Here's an early job to begin with .
 Having thus given his parent God speed , young Jerry seated himself on the stool , entered on his reversionary interest in the straw his father had been chewing , and cogitated .
 You know the Old Bailey , well , no doubt .
 said one of the oldest of clerks to Jerry the messenger .
 Ye-es , sir , returned Jerry , in something of a dogged manner .
 I DO know the Bailey .
 Just so .
 And you know MrLorry .
 Very well .
 Find the door where the witnesses go in , and show the door-keeper this note for MrLorry .
 He will then let you in .
 Into the court , sir .
 MrCruncher's eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another , and to interchange the inquiry , What do you think of this .
 Am I to wait in the court , sir .
 he asked , as the result of that conference .
 Is that all , sir .
 That's all .
 He wishes to have a messenger at hand .
 This is to tell him you are there .
 I suppose they'll be trying Forgeries this morning .
 That's quartering , said Jerry .
 Barbarous .
 It is the law , remarked the ancient clerk , turning his surprised spectacles upon him .
 It is the law .
 It's hard in the law to spile a man , I think .
 Ifs hard enough to kill him , but it's wery hard to spile him , sir .
 It's the damp , sir , what settles on my chest and voice , said Jerry .
 I leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is .
 After some delay and demur , the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a very little way , and allowed MrJerry Cruncher to squeeze himself into court .
 What's on .
 he asked , in a whisper , of the man he found himself next to .
 Nothing yet .
 What's coming on .
 The Treason case .
 The quartering one , eh .
 If he's found Guilty , you mean to say .
 Jerry added , by way of proviso .
 What's HE got to do with the case .
 asked the man he had spoken with .
 Blest if I know , said Jerry .
 What have YOU got to do with it , then , if a person may inquire .
 Blest if I know that either , said Jerry .
 Over the prisoner's head there was a mirror , to throw the light down upon him .
 Crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in it , and had passed from its surface and this earth's together .
 Haunted in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been , if the glass could ever have rendered back its reflections , as the ocean is one day to give up its dead .
 Some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace for which it had been reserved , may have struck the prisoner's mind .
 Be that as it may , a change in his position making him conscious of a bar of light across his face , he looked up .
 and when he saw the glass his face flushed , and his right hand pushed the herbs away .
 It happened , that the action turned his face to that side of the court which was on his left .
 About on a level with his eyes , there sat , in that corner of the Judge's bench , two persons upon whom his look immediately rested .
 so immediately , and so much to the changing of his aspect , that all the eyes that were tamed upon him , turned to them .
 The spectators saw in the two figures , a young lady of little more than twenty , and a gentleman who was evidently her father .
 a man of a very remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair , and a certain indescribable intensity of face : not of an active kind , but pondering and self-communing .
 When this expression was upon him , he looked as if he were old .
 but when it was stirred and broken up--as it was now , in a moment , on his speaking to his daughter--he became a handsome man , not past the prime of life .
 His daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm , as she sat by him , and the other pressed upon it .
 She had drawn close to him , in her dread of the scene , and in her pity for the prisoner .
  But , however that may be , resumed the nephew , glancing at him with deep distrust , I know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means , and would know no scruple as to means .
 I recall it .
 Thank you , said the Marquisevery sweetly indeed .
 His tone lingered in the air , almost like the tone of a musical instrument .
 I do not quite understand , returned the uncle , sipping his coffee .
 Dare I ask you to explain .
 I believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court , and had not been overshadowed by that cloud for years past , a letter de cachet would have sent me to some fortress indefinitely .
 I perceive that , happily for me , the Reception of the day before yesterday was , as usual , a cold one , observed the nephew .
 The Marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff , and shook his head .
 as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still containing himself , that great means of regeneration .
 We have so asserted our station , both in the old time and in the modern time also , said the nephew , gloomily , that I believe our name to be more detested than any name in France .
 Let us hope so , said the uncle .
 Detestation of the high is the involuntary homage of the low .
 Repression is the only lasting philosophy .
 The dark deference of fear and slavery , my friend , observed the Marquis , will keep the dogs obedient to the whip , as long as this roof , looking up to it , shuts out the sky .
 That might not be so long as the Marquis supposed .
 If a picture of the chateau as it was to be a very few years hence , and of fifty like it as they too were to be a very few years hence , could have been shown to him that night , he might have been at a loss to claim his own from the ghastly , fire-charred , plunder-wrecked rains .
 As for the roof he vaunted , he might have found THAT shutting out the sky in a new wayto wit , for ever , from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead was fired , out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets .
 Meanwhile , said the Marquis , I will preserve the honour and repose of the family , if you will not .
 But you must be fatigued .
 Shall we terminate our conference for the night .
 A moment more .
 An hour , if you please .
 Sir , said the nephew , we have done wrong , and are reaping the fruits of wrong .
 WE have done wrong .
 repeated the Marquis , with an inquiring smile , and delicately pointing , first to his nephew , then to himself .
 Death has done that .
 said the Marquis .
 My friend , I will die , perpetuating the system under which I have lived .
 When he had said it , he took a culminating pinch of snuff , and put his box in his pocket .
 Better to be a rational creature , he added then , after ringing a small bell on the table , and accept your natural destiny .
 But you are lost , Monsieur Charles , I see .
 This property and France are lost to me , said the nephew , sadly .
 I renounce them .
 I had no intention , in the words I used , to claim it yet .
 If it passed to me from you , tomorrow .
 Which I have the vanity to hope is not probable .
 or twenty years hence .
 You do me too much honour , said the Marquis .
 still , I prefer that supposition .
 I would abandon it , and live otherwise and elsewhere .
 It is little to relinquish .
 What is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin .
 Hah .
 said the Marquis , glancing round the luxurious room .
 Hah .
 said the Marquis again , in a well-satisfied manner .
 In England , for example .
 Yes .
 The family honour , sir , is safe from me in this country .
 The family name can suffer from me in no other , for I bear it in no other .
 The ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed-chamber to be lighted .
 It now shone brightly , through the door of communication .
 The Marquis looked that way , and listened for the retreating step of his valet .
 I have already said , that for my prospering there , I am sensible I may be indebted to you , sir .
 For the rest , it is my Refuge .
 They say , those boastful English , that it is the Refuge of many .
 You know a compatriot who has found a Refuge there .
 A Doctor .
 With a daughter .
 Yes , said the Marquis .
 You are fatigued .
 Good night .
 Yes , repeated the Marquis .
 A Doctor with a daughter .
 Yes .
 So commences the new philosophy .
 You are fatigued .
 Good night .
 It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his .
 The nephew looked at him , in vain , in passing on to the door .
 I am cool now , said Monsieur the Marquis , and may go to bed .
 For three heavy hours , the stone faces of the chateau , lion and human , stared blindly at the night .
 Dead darkness lay on all the landscape , dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads .
 The burial-place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass were undistinguishable from one another .
 the figure on the Cross might have come down , for anything that could be seen of it .
 In the village , taxers and taxed were fast asleep .
 Dreaming , perhaps , of banquets , as the starved usually do , and of ease and rest , as the driven slave and the yoked ox may , its lean inhabitants slept soundly , and were fed and freed .
 The Gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night , and had added the one stone face wanting .
 the stone face for which it had waited through about two hundred years .
 Drive him fast to his tomb .
 This , from Jacques .
 In London , he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold , nor to lie on beds of roses .
 if he had had any such exalted expectation , he would not have prospered .
 He had expected labour , and he found it , and did it and made the best of it .
 In this , his prosperity consisted .
 Charles Darnay .
 I rejoice to see you .
 We have been counting on your return these three or four days past .
 MrStryver and Sydney Carton were both here yesterday , and both made you out to be more than due .
 I am obliged to them for their interest in the matter , he answered , a little coldly as to them , though very warmly as to the Doctor .
 Miss Manette .
 said the Doctor , with evident constraint .
 Bring your chair here , and speak on .
 He complied as to the chair , but appeared to find the speaking on less easy .
 He was stayed by the Doctor's putting out his hand to stop him .
 When he had kept it so a little while , he said , drawing it back : 
 Is Lucie the topic .
 She is .
 It is hard for me to speak of her at any time .
 It is very hard for me to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours , Charles Darnay .
 I believe it .
 I do you justice .
 I believe it .
 His constraint was so manifest , and it was so manifest , too , that it originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject , that Charles Darnay hesitated .
 Shall I go on , sir .
 Another blank .
 Not that , sir .
 Let that be .
 I adjure you , do not recall that .
 I ask your pardon , said the Doctor , in a subdued tone , after some moments .
 I do not doubt your loving Lucie .
 you may be satisfied of it .
 Have you spoken to Lucie .
 Nor written .
 Never .
 It would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self-denial is to be referred to your consideration for her father .
 Her father thanks you .
 I believe it , answered her father , mournfully .
 I have thought so before now .
 I believe it .
 He laid his own upon it as he spoke .
 No , dear Doctor Manette .
 Like you , a voluntary exile from France .
 like you , driven from it by its distractions , oppressions , and miseries .
 like you , striving to live away from it by my own exertions , and trusting in a happier future .
 I look only to sharing your fortunes , sharing your life and home , and being faithful to you to the death .
 Not to divide with Lucie her privilege as your child , companion , and friend .
 but to come in aid of it , and bind her closer to you , if such a thing can be .
 His touch still lingered on her father's hand .
 Answering the touch for a moment , but not coldly , her father rested his hands upon the arms of his chair , and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the conference .
 A struggle was evidently in his face .
 a struggle with that occasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread .
 As yet , none .
 Is it the immediate object of this confidence , that you may at once ascertain that , with my knowledge .
 Not even so .
 I might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks .
 I might mistaken or not mistaken have that hopefulness tomorrow .
 Do you seek any guidance from me .
 Do you seek any promise from me .
 I do seek that .
 What is it .
 I well understand that , without you , I could have no hope .
 I well understand that , even if Miss Manette held me at this moment in her innocent heartdo not think I have the presumption to assume so muchI could retain no place in it against her love for her father .
 If that be so , do you see what , on the other hand , is involved in it .
 I am sure of it .
 Charles Darnay , mysteries arise out of close love , as well as out of wide division .
 in the former case , they are subtle and delicate , and difficult to penetrate .
 My daughter Lucie is , in this one respect , such a mystery to me .
 I can make no guess at the state of her heart .
 May I ask , sir , if you think she is As he hesitated , her father supplied the rest .
 Is sought by any other suitor .
 It is what I meant to say .
 Her father considered a little before he answered : 
 You have seen MrCarton here , yourself .
 MrStryver is here too , occasionally .
 If it be at all , it can only be by one of these .
 Or both , said Darnay .
 I had not thought of both .
 I should not think either , likely .
 You want a promise from me .
 Tell me what it is .
 I give the promise , said the Doctor , without any condition .
 I believe your object to be , purely and truthfully , as you have stated it .
 I believe your intention is to perpetuate , and not to weaken , the ties between me and my other and far dearer self .
 If she should ever tell me that you are essential to her perfect happiness , I will give her to you .
 If there were Charles Darnay , if there were .
 The young man had taken his hand gratefully .
 their hands were joined as the Doctor spoke : 
 any fancies , any reasons , any apprehensions , anything whatsoever , new or old , against the man she really lovedthe direct responsibility thereof not lying on his headthey should all be obliterated for her sake .
 She is everything to me .
 more to me than suffering , more to me than wrong , more to meWell .
 This is idle talk .
 Hardly , I think .
 I doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to understand these perplexed distinctions .
 His collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from running cold , as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition .
 In that more peaceful state , I have imagined her , in the moonlight , coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father .
 My picture was in her room , and I was in her prayers .
 Her life was active , cheerful , useful .
 but my poor history pervaded it all .
 "I am that child , I hope , my father .
 O my dear , my dear , will you bless me as fervently to-morrow .
 He embraced her , solemnly commended her to Heaven , and humbly thanked Heaven for having bestowed her on him .
 By-and-bye , they went into the house .
 There was no one bidden to the marriage but MrLorry .
 there was even to be no bridesmaid but the gaunt Miss Pross .
 The marriage was to make no change in their place of residence .
 they had been able to extend it , by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the apocryphal invisible lodger , and they desired nothing more .
 Doctor Manette was very cheerful at the little supper .
 They were only three at table , and Miss Pross made the third .
 He regretted that Charles was not there .
 was more than half disposed to object to the loving little plot that kept him away .
 and drank to him affectionately .
 All things , however , were in their places .
 all was quiet .
 and he lay asleep , his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow , and his hands lying quiet on the coverlet .
 She put her needless candle in the shadow at a distance , crept up to his bed , and put her lips to his .
 then , leaned over him , and looked at him .
 Into his handsome face , the bitter waters of captivity had worn .
 but , he covered up their tracks with a determination so strong , that he held the mastery of them even in his sleep .
 A more remarkable face in its quiet , resolute , and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant , was not to be beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep , that night .
 She timidly laid her hand on his dear breast , and put up a prayer that she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be , and as his sorrows deserved .
 Then , she withdrew her hand , and kissed his lips once more , and went away .
 So , the sunrise came , and the shadows of the leaves of the plane-tree moved upon his face , as softly as her lips had moved in praying for him .
 And so , said MrLorry , who could not sufficiently admire the bride , and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet , pretty dress .
 and so it was for this , my sweet Lucie , that I brought you across the Channel , such a baby .
 Lord bless me .
 How little I thought what I was doing .
 How lightly I valued the obligation I was conferring on my friend MrCharles .
 You didn't mean it , remarked the matter-of-fact Miss Pross , and therefore how could you know it .
 Nonsense .
 Really .
 Well .
 but don't cry , said the gentle MrLorry .
 I am not crying , said Miss Pross .
 YOU are .
 I , my Pross .
 By this time , MrLorry dared to be pleasant with her , on occasion .
 You were , just now .
 I saw you do it , and I don't wonder at it .
 Such a present of plate as you have made ëem , is enough to bring tears into anybody's eyes .
 There's not a fork or a spoon in the collection , said Miss Pross , that I didn't cry over , last night after the box came , till I couldn't see it .
 Not at all .
 From Miss Pross .
 You think there never might have been a MrsLorry .
 asked the gentleman of that name .
 Pooh .
 rejoined Miss Pross .
 you were a bachelor in your cradle .
 And you were cut out for a bachelor , pursued Miss Pross , before you were put in your cradle .
 He gave his arm to his daughter , and took her down-stairs to the chariot which MrLorry had hired in honour of the day .
 The rest followed in another carriage , and soon , in a neighbouring church , where no strange eyes looked on , Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married .
 It was a hard parting , though it was not for long .
 But her father cheered her , and said at last , gently disengaging himself from her enfolding arms , Take her , Charles .
 She is yours .
 He had naturally repressed much , and some revulsion might have been expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone .
 But , it was the old scared lost look that troubled MrLorry .
 and through his absent manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own room when they got up-stairs , MrLorry was reminded of Defarge the wine-shop keeper , and the starlight ride .
 I think , he whispered to Miss Pross , after anxious consideration , I think we had best not speak to him just now , or at all disturb him .
 I must look in at Tellson's .
 so I will go there at once and come back presently .
 Then , we will take him a ride into the country , and dine there , and all will be well .
 It was easier for MrLorry to look in at Tellson's , than to look out of Tellson's .
 He was detained two hours .
 When he came back , he ascended the old staircase alone , having asked no question of the servant .
 going thus into the Doctor's rooms , he was stopped by a low sound of knocking .
 Good God .
 he said , with a start .
 What's that .
 MrLorry glanced at the work in his hand , and observed that it was a shoe of the old size and shape .
 He took up another that was lying by him , and asked what it was .
 A young lady's walking shoe , he muttered , without looking up .
 It ought to have been finished long ago .
 Let it be .
 He obeyed , in the old mechanically submissive manner , without pausing in his work .
 You know me , my dear friend .
 Think again .
 This is not your proper occupation .
 Think , dear friend .
 These measures , advisable to be taken in any case , MrLorry took in the hope of his coming to himself .
 If that should happen soon , he kept another course in reserve .
 which was , to have a certain opinion that he thought the best , on the Doctor's case .
 In the hope of his recovery , and of resort to this third course being thereby rendered practicable , MrLorry resolved to watch him attentively , with as little appearance as possible of doing so .
 He therefore made arrangements to absent himself from Tellson's for the first time in his life , and took his post by the window in the same room .
 He was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak to him , since , on being pressed , he became worried .
 He abandoned that attempt on the first day , and resolved merely to keep himself always before him , as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had fallen , or was falling .
 He remained , therefore , in his seat near the window , reading and writing , and expressing in as many pleasant and natural ways as he could think of , that it was a free place .
 Will you go out .
 Out .
 Yes .
 for a walk with me .
 Why not .
 When it fell dark again , MrLorry asked him as before : 
 Dear Doctor , will you go out .
 As before , he repeated , Out .
 Worn out by anxious watching , MrLorry fell asleep at his post .
 On The tenth morning of his suspense , he was startled by the shining of the sun into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark night .
 Even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake , MrLorry felt giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might not be a disturbed dream of his own .
 for , did not his eyes show him his friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect , and employed as usual .
 and was there any sign within their range , that the change of which he had so strong an impression had actually happened .
 Within a few minutes , Miss Pross stood whispering at his side .
 If he had had any particle of doubt left , her talk would of necessity have resolved it .
 but he was by that time clear-headed , and had none .
 He advised that they should let the time go by until the regular breakfast-hour , and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual had occurred .
 If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind , MrLorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from the opinion he had been , in his anxiety , so anxious to obtain .
 Miss Pross , submitting herself to his judgment , the scheme was worked out with care .
 Having abundance of time for his usual methodical toilette , MrLorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual white linen , and with his usual neat leg .
 The Doctor was summoned in the usual way , and came to breakfast .
 If I understand , said the Doctor , in a subdued tone , some mental shock .
 Yes .
 Be explicit , said the Doctor .
 Spare no detail .
 MrLorry saw that they understood one another , and proceeded .
 The Doctor , in a low voice , asked , Of how long duration .
 Nine days and nights .
 That is the fact .
 Now , did you ever see him , asked the Doctor , distinctly and collectedly , though in the same low voice , engaged in that pursuit originally .
 Once .
 And when the relapse fell on him , was he in most respectsor in all respectsas he was then .
 I think in all respects .
 You spoke of his daughter .
 Does his daughter know of the relapse .
 No .
 It has been kept from her , and I hope will always be kept from her .
 It is known only to myself , and to one other who may be trusted .
 But I don't know how to originate , in such a case .
 If your sagacity , knowledge , and experience , could put me on the right track , I might be able to do so much .
 unenlightened and undirected , I can do so little .
 Pray discuss it with me .
 pray enable me to see it a little more clearly , and teach me how to be a little more useful .
 I think it probable , said the Doctor , breaking silence with an effort , that the relapse you have described , my dear friend , was not quite unforeseen by its subject .
 Was it dreaded by him .
 MrLorry ventured to ask .
 Very much .
 He said it with an involuntary shudder .
 You have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer's mind , and how difficulthow almost impossibleit is , for him to force himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him .
 Would he , asked MrLorry , be sensibly relieved if he could prevail upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one , when it is on him .
 I think so .
 But it is , as I have told you , next to impossible .
 I even believe itin some casesto be quite impossible .
 Would he remember what took place in the relapse .
 asked MrLorry , with natural hesitation .
 The Doctor looked desolately round the room , shook his head , and answered , in a low voice , Not at all .
 As to the future , said the Doctor , recovering firmness , I should have great hope .
 As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon , I should have great hope .
 He , yielding under the pressure of a complicated something , long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against , and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed , I should hope that the worst was over .
 Well , well .
 That's good comfort .
 I am thankful .
 said MrLorry .
 I am thankful .
 repeated the Doctor , bending his head with reverence .
 There are two other points , said MrLorry , on which I am anxious to be instructed .
 I may go on .
 You cannot do your friend a better service .
 The Doctor gave him his hand .
 I think not .
 It may be the character of his mind , to be always in singular need of occupation .
 That may be , in part , natural to it .
 in part , the result of affliction .
 The less it was occupied with healthy things , the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy direction .
 He may have observed himself , and made the discovery .
 You are sure that he is not under too great a strain .
 I think I am quite sure of it .
 My dear Manette , if he were overworked now .
 The occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction so happily recovered from , said MrLorry , clearing his throat , we will callBlacksmith's work , Blacksmith's work .
 Influence .
 he says something touching influence .
 Surely it will release him .
 said Madame Defarge .
 Let it do so .
 Madame Defarge looked , coldly as ever , at the suppliant , and said , turning to her friend The Vengeance : 
 We have seen nothing else , returned The Vengeance .
 We have borne this a long time , said Madame Defarge , turning her eyes again upon Lucie .
 Judge you .
 Is it likely that the trouble of one wife and mother would be much to us now .
 She resumed her knitting and went out .
 The Vengeance followed .
 Defarge went last , and closed the door .
 I am not thankless , I hope , but that dreadful woman seems to throw a shadow on me and on all my hopes .
 But the shadow of the manner of these Defarges was dark upon himself , for all that , and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly .
 As MrLorry received these confidences , and as he watched the face of his friend now sixty-two years of age , a misgiving arose within him that such dread experiences would revive the old danger .
 It sheared off heads so many , that it , and the ground it most polluted , were a rotten red .
 It was taken to pieces , like a toy-puzzle for a young Devil , and was put together again when the occasion wanted it .
 It hushed the eloquent , struck down the powerful , abolished the beautiful and good .
 Twenty-two friends of high public mark , twenty-one living and one dead , it had lopped the heads off , in one morning , in as many minutes .
 The name of the strong man of Old Scripture had descended to the chief functionary who worked it .
 but , so armed , he was stronger than his namesake , and blinder , and tore away the gates of God's own Temple every day .
 One year and three months .
 During all that time Lucie was never sure , from hour to hour , but that the Guillotine would strike off her husband's head next day .
 Every day , through the stony streets , the tumbrils now jolted heavily , filled with Condemned .
 Lovely girls .
 bright women , brown-haired , black-haired , and grey .
 youths .
 stalwart men and old .
 gentle born and peasant born .
 all red wine for La Guillotine , all daily brought into light from the dark cellars of the loathsome prisons , and carried to her through the streets to slake her devouring thirst .
 Liberty , equality , fraternity , or death .
 the last , much the easiest to bestow , O Guillotine .
 If the suddenness of her calamity , and the whirling wheels of the time , had stunned the Doctor's daughter into awaiting the result in idle despair , it would but have been with her as it was with many .
 But , from the hour when she had taken the white head to her fresh young bosom in the garret of Saint Antoine , she had been true to her duties .
 She was truest to them in the season of trial , as all the quietly loyal and good will always be .
 They had not made the round of their changed life many weeks , when her father said to her , on coming home one evening : 
 O show me the place , my father , and I will go there every day .
 It was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street .
 The hovel of a cutter of wood into lengths for burning , was the only house at that end .
 all else was wall .
 On the third day of her being there , he noticed her .
 Good day , citizeness .
 Good day , citizen .
 Walking here again , citizeness .
 You see me , citizen .
 Next day he was looking out for her , and accosted her the moment she appeared .
 Walking here again , citizeness .
 Your mother , is it not , my little citizeness .
 Do I say yes , mamma .
 whispered little Lucie , drawing close to her .
 The billet fell as he spoke , and he threw it into a basket .
 These occupations brought her round to the December month , wherein her father walked among the terrors with a steady head .
 On a lightly-snowing afternoon she arrived at the usual corner .
 It was a day of some wild rejoicing , and a festival .
 She had seen the houses , as she came along , decorated with little pikes , and with little red caps stuck upon them .
 also , with tricoloured ribbons .
 also , with the standard inscription tricoloured letters were the favourite , Republic One and Indivisible .
 Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death .
 The miserable shop of the wood-sawyer was so small , that its whole surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend .
 He had got somebody to scrawl it up for him , however , who had squeezed Death in with most inappropriate difficulty .
 On his house-top , he displayed pike and cap , as a good citizen must , and in a window he had stationed his saw inscribed as his Little Sainte Guillotine for the great sharp female was by that time popularly canonised .
 His shop was shut and he was not there , which was a relief to Lucie , and left her quite alone .
 I do so , father , and I send him my Soul with it .
 You cannot see him , my poor dear .
 Give me your arm , my love .
 Pass from here with an air of cheerfulness and courage , for his sake .
 That was well done .
 they had left the spot .
 it shall not be in vain .
 Charles is summoned for tomorrow .
 I must see Lorry , the Doctor repeated , turning her another way .
 The staunch old gentleman was still in his trust .
 had never left it .
 He and his books were in frequent requisition as to property confiscated and made national .
 What he could save for the owners , he saved .
 No better man living to hold fast by what Tellson's had in keeping , and to hold his peace .
 A murky red and yellow sky , and a rising mist from the Seine , denoted the approach of darkness .
 It was almost dark when they arrived at the Bank .
 The stately residence of Monseigneur was altogether blighted and deserted .
 Above a heap of dust and ashes in the court , ran the letters : National Property .
 Republic One and Indivisible .
 Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death .
 Charles Evremonde , called Darnay .
 So at last began the Evening Paper at La Force .
 When a name was called , its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded .
 Charles Evremonde , called Darnay , had reason to know the usage .
 he had seen hundreds pass away so .
 Charles Evremonde , called Darnay , was at length arraigned .
 Take off his head .
 cried the audience .
 An enemy to the Republic .
 The President rang his bell to silence those cries , and asked the prisoner whether it was not true that he had lived many years in England .
 Undoubtedly it was .
 Not an emigrant , he hoped , within the sense and spirit of the law .
 What proof had he of this .
 True , but not an English woman .
 A citizeness of France .
 Her name and family .
 This answer had a happy effect upon the audience .
 Cries in exaltation of the well-known good physician rent the hall .
 So capriciously were the people moved , that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before , as if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill him .
 The President asked , why had he returned to France when he did , and not sooner .
 He had not returned sooner , he replied , simply because he had no means of living in France , save those he had resigned .
 whereas , in England , he lived by giving instruction in the French language and literature .
 He had returned when he did , on the pressing and written entreaty of a French citizen , who represented that his life was endangered by his absence .
 He had come back , to save a citizen's life , and to bear his testimony , at whatever personal hazard , to the truth .
 Was that criminal in the eyes of the Republic .
 The populace cried enthusiastically , No .
 and the President rang his bell to quiet them .
 Which it did not , for they continued to cry No .
 until they left off , of their own will .
 The President required the name of that citizen .
 The accused explained that the citizen was his first witness .
 He also referred with confidence to the citizen's letter , which had been taken from him at the Barrier , but which he did not doubt would be found among the papers then before the President .
 O dearest Charles , let me thank God for this on my knees as I have prayed to Him .
 They all reverently bowed their heads and hearts .
 When she was again in his arms , he said to her : 
 And now speak to your father , dearest .
 No other man in all this France could have done what he has done for me .
 For some months past , Miss Pross and MrCruncher had discharged the office of purveyors .
 the former carrying the money .
 the latter , the basket .
 Every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were lighted , they fared forth on this duty , and made and brought home such purchases as were needful .
 Although Miss Pross , through her long association with a French family , might have known as much of their language as of her own , if she had had a mind , she had no mind in that direction .
 consequently she knew no more of that nonsense as she was pleased to call it than MrCruncher did .
 So her manner of marketing was to plump a noun-substantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any introduction in the nature of an article , and , if it happened not to be the name of the thing she wanted , to look round for that thing , lay hold of it , and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded .
 She always made a bargain for it , by holding up , as a statement of its just price , one finger less than the merchant held up , whatever his number might be .
 Jerry hoarsely professed himself at Miss Pross's service .
 He had worn all his rust off long ago , but nothing would file his spiky head down .
 It will be much the same to your knowledge , miss , I should think , retorted Jerry , whether they drink your health or the Old Un's .
 Who's he .
 said Miss Pross .
 MrCruncher , with some diffidence , explained himself as meaning Old Nick's .
 Hush , dear .
 Pray , pray , be cautious .
 cried Lucie .
 I think you may take that liberty , the Doctor answered , smiling .
 For gracious sake , don't talk about Liberty .
 we have quite enough of that , said Miss Pross .
 Hush , dear .
 Again .
 Lucie remonstrated .
 MrCruncher , in an access of loyalty , growlingly repeated the words after Miss Pross , like somebody at church .
 I fear not yet .
 It would be dangerous for Charles yet .
 What is that .
 she cried , all at once .
 My love , the staircase is as still as Death .
 As he said the word , a blow was struck upon the door .
 Oh father , father .
 What can this be .
 Hide Charles .
 Save him .
 He took the lamp in his hand , crossed the two intervening outer rooms , and opened it .
 A rude clattering of feet over the floor , and four rough men in red caps , armed with sabres and pistols , entered the room .
 The Citizen Evremonde , called Darnay , said the first .
 I seek him .
 We seek him .
 I know you , Evremonde .
 I saw you before the Tribunal to-day .
 You are again the prisoner of the Republic .
 The four surrounded him , where he stood with his wife and child clinging to him .
 Tell me how and why am I again a prisoner .
 It is enough that you return straight to the Conciergerie , and will know to-morrow .
 You are summoned for to-morrow .
 You know him , you have said .
 Do you know me .
 Yes , I know you , Citizen Doctor .
 We all know you , Citizen Doctor , said the other three .
 Will you answer his question to me then .
 How does this happen .
 The citizen here indicated nodded his head , and added : 
  Do I date it .
 No .
 If you remember , ' said Carton , dictating , ëthe words that passed between us , long ago , you will readily comprehend this when you see it .
 You do remember them , I know .
 It is not in your nature to forget them .
 Have you written ëforget them' .
 Carton asked .
 I have .
 Is that a weapon in your hand .
 No .
 I am not armed .
 What is it in your hand .
 The pen dropped from Darnay's fingers on the table , and he looked about him vacantly .
 What vapour is that .
 he asked .
 Vapour .
 Something that crossed me .
 I am conscious of nothing .
 there can be nothing here .
 Take up the pen and finish .
 Hurry , hurry .
 Hurry , hurry .
 The prisoner bent over the paper , once more .
 Carton's hand moved back to his breast no more .
 The prisoner sprang up with a reproachful look , but Carton's hand was close and firm at his nostrils , and Carton's left arm caught him round the waist .
 For a few seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to lay down his life for him .
 but , within a minute or so , he was stretched insensible on the ground .
 MrCarton , the Spy answered , with a timid snap of his fingers , my hazard is not THAT , in the thick of business here , if you are true to the whole of your bargain .
 Don't fear me .
 I will be true to the death .
 You must be , MrCarton , if the tale of fifty-two is to be right .
 Being made right by you in that dress , I shall have no fear .
 You .
 said the Spy nervously .
 Him , man , with whom I have exchanged .
 You go out at the gate by which you brought me in .
 Of course .
 I was weak and faint when you brought me in , and I am fainter now you take me out .
 The parting interview has overpowered me .
 Such a thing has happened here , often , and too often .
 Your life is in your own hands .
 Quick .
 Call assistance .
 You swear not to betray me .
 said the trembling Spy , as he paused for a last moment .
 How , then .
 said one of them , contemplating the fallen figure .
 So afflicted to find that his friend has drawn a prize in the lottery of Sainte Guillotine .
 A good patriot , said the other , could hardly have been more afflicted if the Aristocrat had drawn a blank .
 The time is short , Evremonde , said the Spy , in a warning voice .
 I know it well , answered Carton .
 Be careful of my friend , I entreat you , and leave me .
 Come , then , my children , said Barsad .
 Lift him , and come away .
 Sounds that he was not afraid of , for he divined their meaning , then began to be audible .
 Several doors were opened in succession , and finally his own .
 A gaoler , with a list in his hand , looked in , merely saying , Follow me , Evremonde .
 and he followed into a large dark room , at a distance .
 It was a dark winter day , and what with the shadows within , and what with the shadows without , he could but dimly discern the others who were brought there to have their arms bound .
 Some were standing .
 some seated .
 Some were lamenting , and in restless motion .
 but , these were few .
 The great majority were silent and still , looking fixedly at the ground .
 He murmured for answer : True .
 I forget what you were accused of .
 Plots .
 Though the just Heaven knows that I am innocent of any .
 Is it likely .
 Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature like me .
 The forlorn smile with which she said it , so touched him , that tears started from his eyes .
 As the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to , it warmed and softened to this pitiable girl .
 I heard you were released , Citizen Evremonde .
 I hoped it was true .
 It was .
 But , I was again taken and condemned .
 If I may ride with you , Citizen Evremonde , will you let me hold your hand .
 I am not afraid , but I am little and weak , and it will give me more courage .
 As the patient eyes were lifted to his face , he saw a sudden doubt in them , and then astonishment .
 He pressed the work-worn , hunger-worn young fingers , and touched his lips .
 Are you dying for him .
 she whispered .
 O you will let me hold your brave hand , stranger .
 Hush .
 Yes , my poor sister .
 to the last .
 The papers are handed out , and read .
 Alexandre Manette .
 Physician .
 French .
 Which is he .
 This is he .
 this helpless , inarticulately murmuring , wandering old man pointed out .
 Apparently the Citizen-Doctor is not in his right mind .
 The Revolution-fever will have been too much for him .
 Greatly too much for him .
 This is she .
 Apparently it must be .
 She and no other .
 Kiss me , child of Evremonde .
 Now , thou hast kissed a good Republican .
 something new in thy family .
 remember it .
 Sydney Carton .
 Advocate .
 English .
 Which is he .
 He lies here , in this corner of the carriage .
 He , too , is pointed out .
 Apparently the English advocate is in a swoon .
 It is hoped he will recover in the fresher air .
 It is represented that he is not in strong health , and has separated sadly from a friend who is under the displeasure of the Republic .
 Is that all .
 It is not a great deal , that .
 Many are under the displeasure of the Republic , and must look out at the little window .
 Jarvis Lorry .
 Banker .
 English .
 Which is he .
 It is Jarvis Lorry who has replied to all the previous questions .
 It is Jarvis Lorry who has alighted and stands with his hand on the coach door , replying to a group of officials .
 They leisurely walk round the carriage and leisurely mount the box , to look at what little luggage it carries on the roof .
 the country-people hanging about , press nearer to the coach doors and greedily stare in .
 a little child , carried by its mother , has its short arm held out for it , that it may touch the wife of an aristocrat who has gone to the Guillotine .
 One can depart , citizen .
 One can depart .
 Forward , my postilions .
 A good journey .
 Are we not going too slowly .
 Can they not be induced to go faster .
 asks Lucie , clinging to the old man .
 It would seem like flight , my darling .
 I must not urge them too much .
 it would rouse suspicion .
 Look back , look back , and see if we are pursued .
 The road is clear , my dearest .
 So far , we are not pursued .
 Ho .
 Within the carriage there .
 Speak then .
 What is it .
 asks MrLorry , looking out at window .
 How many did they say .
 I do not understand you .
 At the last post .
 How many to the Guillotine to-day .
 Fifty-two .
 I said so .
 A brave number .
 My fellow-citizen here would have it forty-two .
 ten more heads are worth having .
 The Guillotine goes handsomely .
 I love it .
 Hi forward .
 Whoop .
 But our Defarge , said Jacques Three , is undoubtedly a good Republican .
 Eh .
 There is no better , the voluble Vengeance protested in her shrill notes , in France .
 Madame Defarge cast down her eyes , and reflected a little .
 The child also , observed Jacques Three , with a meditative enjoyment of his words , has golden hair and blue eyes .
 And we seldom have a child there .
 It is a pretty sight .
 In a word , said Madame Defarge , coming out of her short abstraction , I cannot trust my husband in this matter .
 Not only do I feel , since last night , that I dare not confide to him the details of my projects .
 but also I feel that if I delay , there is danger of his giving warning , and then they might escape .
 That must never be , croaked Jacques Three .
 no one must escape .
 We have not half enough as it is .
 We ought to have six score a day .
 The wood-sawyer , who held her in the respect , and himself in the submission , of mortal fear , advanced with his hand to his red cap .
 Touching those signals , little citizen , said Madame Defarge , sternly , that she made to the prisoners .
 you are ready to bear witness to them this very day .
 He made all manner of gestures while he spoke , as if in incidental imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had never seen .
