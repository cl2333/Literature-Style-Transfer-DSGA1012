 For , the time was to come , when the gaunt scarecrows of that region should have watched the lamplighter , in their idleness and hunger , so long , as to conceive the idea of improving on his method , and hauling up men by those ropes and pulleys , to flare upon the darkness of their condition . But , the time was not come yet ; and every wind that blew over France shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain , for the birds , fine of song and feather , took no warning . 
 The wine-shop was a corner shop , better than most others in its appearance and degree , and the master of the wine-shop had stood outside it , in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches , looking on at the struggle for the lost wine . It's not my affair , said he , with a final shrug of the shoulders . The people from the market did it . Let them bring another . There , his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke , he called to him across the way : 
 Say , then , my Gaspard , what do you do there ? The fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance , as is often the way with his tribe . It missed its mark , and completely failed , as is often the way with his tribe too . What now ? Are you a subject for the mad hospital ? said the wine-shop keeper , crossing the road , and obliterating the jest with a handful of mud , picked up for the purpose , and smeared over it . Why do you write in the public streets ? Is theretell me thouis there no other place to write such words in ? 
 In his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand (perhaps accidentally , perhaps not) upon the joker's heart . The joker rapped it with his own , took a nimble spring upward , and came down in a fantastic dancing attitude , with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his hand , and held out . A joker of an extremely , not to say wolfishly practical character , he looked , under those circumstances . 
 Put it on , put it on , said the other . Call wine , wine ; and finish there . With that advice , he wiped his soiled hand upon the joker's dress , such as it wasquite deliberately , as having dirtied the hand on his account ; and then recrossed the road and entered the wine-shop . This wine-shop keeper was a bull-necked , martial-looking man of thirty , and he should have been of a hot temperament , for , although it was a bitter day , he wore no coat , but carried one slung over his shoulder .
 His shirt-sleeves were rolled up , too , and his brown arms were bare to the elbows . Neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own crisply-curling short dark hair . He was a dark man altogether , with good eyes and a good bold breadth between them . Good-humoured looking on the whole , but implacable-looking , too ; evidently a man of a strong resolution and a set purpose ; a man not desirable to be met , rushing down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side , for nothing would turn the man . 
 Madame Defarge , his wife , sat in the shop behind the counter as he came in . Madame Defarge was a stout woman of about his own age , with a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything , a large hand heavily ringed , a steady face , strong features , and great composure of manner . There was a character about Madame Defarge , from which one might have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself in any of the reckonings over which she presided . Madame Defarge being sensitive to cold , was wrapped in fur , and had a quantity of bright shawl twined about her head , though not to the concealment of her large earrings . 
 Her knitting was before her , but she had laid it down to pick her teeth with a toothpick . Thus engaged , with her right elbow supported by her left hand , Madame Defarge said nothing when her lord came in , but coughed just one grain of cough . This , in combination with the lifting of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a line , suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the shop among the customers , for any new customer who had dropped in while he stepped over the way . 
 The wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about , until they rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady , who were seated in a corner . Other company were there : two playing cards , two playing dominoes , three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply of wine . As he passed behind the counter , he took notice that the elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady , This is our man . 
 What the devil YOU do in that galley there ? said Monsieur Defarge to himself ; I don't know you . But , he feigned not to notice the two strangers , and fell into discourse with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter . How goes it , Jacques ? said one of these three to Monsieur Defarge . Is all the spilt wine swallowed ? Every drop , Jacques , answered Monsieur Defarge . 
 When this interchange of Christian name was effected , Madame Defarge , picking her teeth with her toothpick , coughed another grain of cough , and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line . It is not often , said the second of the three , addressing Monsieur Defarge , that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine , or of anything but black bread and death . Is it not so , Jacques ? 
 It is so , Jacques , Monsieur Defarge returned . At this second interchange of the Christian name , Madame Defarge , still using her toothpick with profound composure , coughed another grain of cough , and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line . The last of the three now said his say , as he put down his empty drinking vessel and smacked his lips . Ah ! So much the worse ! A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle always have in their mouths , and hard lives they live , Jacques . Am I right , Jacques ? 
 You are right , Jacques , was the response of Monsieur Defarge . This third interchange of the Christian name was completed at the moment when Madame Defarge put her toothpick by , kept her eyebrows up , and slightly rustled in her seat . Hold then ! True ! muttered her husband . Gentlemenmy wife ! The three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge , with three flourishes . She acknowledged their homage by bending her head , and giving them a quick look . Then she glanced in a casual manner round the wine-shop , took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose of spirit , and became absorbed in it . 
 Gentlemen , said her husband , who had kept his bright eye observantly upon her , good day . The chamber , furnished bachelor-fashion , that you wished to see , and were inquiring for when I stepped out , is on the fifth floor . The doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard close to the left here , pointing with his hand , near to the window of my establishment . But , now that I remember , one of you has already been there , and can show the way . Gentlemen , adieu ! 
 They paid for their wine , and left the place . The eyes of Monsieur Defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly gentleman advanced from his corner , and begged the favour of a word . Willingly , sir , said Monsieur Defarge , and quietly stepped with him to the door . Their conference was very short , but very decided . Almost at the first word , Monsieur Defarge started and became deeply attentive . It had not lasted a minute , when he nodded and went out . The gentleman then beckoned to the young lady , and they , too , went out . Madame Defarge knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows , and saw nothing . 
 Mr . Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette , emerging from the wine-shop thus , joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own company just before . It opened from a stinking little black courtyard , and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses , inhabited by a great number of people . In the gloomy tile-paved entry to the gloomy tile-paved staircase , Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee to the child of his old master , and put her hand to his lips . It was a gentle action , but not at all gently done ; a very remarkable transformation had come over him in a few seconds . He had no good-humour in his face , nor any openness of aspect left , but had become a secret , angry , dangerous man . 
 It is very high ; it is a little difficult . Better to begin slowly . Thus , Monsieur Defarge , in a stern voice , to Mr . Lorry , as they began ascending the stairs . Is he alone ? the latter whispered . Alone ! God help him , who should be with him ! said the other , in the same low voice . Is he always alone , then ? Yes . Of his own desire ? Of his own necessity . As he was , when I first saw him after they found me and demanded to know if I would take him , and , at my peril be discreetas he was then , so he is now . 
 He is greatly changed ? Changed ! The keeper of the wine-shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand , and mutter a tremendous curse . No direct answer could have been half so forcible . Mr . Lorry's spirits grew heavier and heavier , as he and his two companions ascended higher and higher . Such a staircase , with its accessories , in the older and more crowded parts of Paris , would be bad enough now ; but , at that time , it was vile indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses . 
 Every little habitation within the great foul nest of one high buildingthat is to say , the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general staircaseleft its own heap of refuse on its own landing , besides flinging other refuse from its own windows . The uncontrollable and hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered , would have polluted the air , even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their intangible impurities ; the two bad sources combined made it almost insupportable . Through such an atmosphere , by a steep dark shaft of dirt and poison , the way lay . 
 Yielding to his own disturbance of mind , and to his young companion's agitation , which became greater every instant , Mr . Jarvis Lorry twice stopped to rest . Each of these stoppages was made at a doleful grating , by which any languishing good airs that were left uncorrupted , seemed to escape , and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed to crawl in . Through the rusted bars , tastes , rather than glimpses , were caught of the jumbled neighbourhood ; and nothing within range , nearer or lower than the summits of the two great towers of Notre-Dame , had any promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations . 
 At last , the top of the staircase was gained , and they stopped for the third time . There was yet an upper staircase , of a steeper inclination and of contracted dimensions , to be ascended , before the garret story was reached . The keeper of the wine-shop , always going a little in advance , and always going on the side which Mr . Lorry took , as though he dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady , turned himself about here , and , carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over his shoulder , took out a key . 
 The door is locked then , my friend ? said Mr . Lorry , surprised . Ay . Yes , was the grim reply of Monsieur Defarge . You think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired ? I think it necessary to turn the key . Monsieur Defarge whispered it closer in his ear , and frowned heavily . Why ? Why ! Because he has lived so long , locked up , that he would be frightenedravetear himself to piecesdiecome to I know not what harmif his door was left open . 
 Is it possible ! exclaimed Mr . Lorry . Is it possible ! repeated Defarge , bitterly . Yes . And a beautiful world we live in , when it IS possible , and when many other such things are possible , and not only possible , but donedone , see you ! under that sky there , every day . Long live the Devil . Let us go on . This dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper , that not a word of it had reached the young lady's ears . But , by this time she trembled under such strong emotion , and her face expressed such deep anxiety , and , above all , such dread and terror , that Mr . Lorry felt it incumbent on him to speak a word or two of reassurance . 
 Courage , dear miss ! Courage ! Business ! The worst will be over in a moment ; it is but passing the room-door , and the worst is over . Then , all the good you bring to him , all the relief , all the happiness you bring to him , begin . Let our good friend here , assist you on that side . That's well , friend Defarge . Come , now . Business , business ! 
 They went up slowly and softly . The staircase was short , and they were soon at the top . There , as it had an abrupt turn in it , they came all at once in sight of three men , whose heads were bent down close together at the side of a door , and who were intently looking into the room to which the door belonged , through some chinks or holes in the wall . On hearing footsteps close at hand , these three turned , and rose , and showed themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the wine-shop . 
 I forgot them in the surprise of your visit , explained Monsieur Defarge . Leave us , good boys ; we have business here . The three glided by , and went silently down . There appearing to be no other door on that floor , and the keeper of the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone , Mr . Lorry asked him in a whisper , with a little anger : Do you make a show of Monsieur Manette ? 
 I show him , in the way you have seen , to a chosen few . Is that well ? I think it is well . Who are the few ? How do you choose them ? I choose them as real men , of my nameJacques is my nameto whom the sight is likely to do good . Enough ; you are English ; that is another thing . Stay there , if you please , a little moment . With an admonitory gesture to keep them back , he stooped , and looked in through the crevice in the wall . Soon raising his head again , he struck twice or thrice upon the doorevidently with no other object than to make a noise there . 
 With the same intention , he drew the key across it , three or four times , before he put it clumsily into the lock , and turned it as heavily as he could . The door slowly opened inward under his hand , and he looked into the room and said something . A faint voice answered something . Little more than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side . He looked back over his shoulder , and beckoned them to enter . Mr . Lorry got his arm securely round the daughter's waist , and held her ; for he felt that she was sinking . 
 A-a-a-business , business ! he urged , with a moisture that was not of business shining on his cheek . Come in , come in ! I am afraid of it , she answered , shuddering . Of it ? What ? I mean of him . Of my father . Rendered in a manner desperate , by her state and by the beckoning of their conductor , he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his shoulder , lifted her a little , and hurried her into the room . He sat her down just within the door , and held her , clinging to him . 
 Defarge drew out the key , closed the door , locked it on the inside , took out the key again , and held it in his hand . All this he did , methodically , and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he could make . Finally , he walked across the room with a measured tread to where the window was . He stopped there , and faced round . The garret , built to be a depository for firewood and the like , was dim and dark : for , the window of dormer shape , was in truth a door in the roof , with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from the street : unglazed , and closing up the middle in two pieces , like any other door of French construction .
 To exclude the cold , one half of this door was fast closed , and the other was opened but a very little way . Such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means , that it was difficult , on first coming in , to see anything ; and long habit alone could have slowly formed in any one , the ability to do any work requiring nicety in such obscurity . Yet , work of that kind was being done in the garret ; for , with his back towards the door , and his face towards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking at him , a white-haired man sat on a low bench , stooping forward and very busy , making shoes . 
 Good day ! said Monsieur Defarge , looking down at the white head that bent low over the shoemaking . It was raised for a moment , and a very faint voice responded to the salutation , as if it were at a distance : Good day ! You are still hard at work , I see ? After a long silence , the head was lifted for another moment , and the voice replied , YesI am working . This time , a pair of haggard eyes had looked at the questioner , before the face had dropped again . 
 The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful . It was not the faintness of physical weakness , though confinement and hard fare no doubt had their part in it . Its deplorable peculiarity was , that it was the faintness of solitude and disuse . It was like the last feeble echo of a sound made long and long ago . So entirely had it lost the life and resonance of the human voice , that it affected the senses like a once beautiful color faded away into a poor weak stain . So sunken and suppressed it was , that it was like a voice underground . So expressive it was , of a hopeless and lost creature , that a famished traveler , wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness , would have remembered home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die . 
 Some minutes of silent work had passed : and the haggard eyes had looked up again : not with any interest or curiosity , but with a dull mechanical perception , beforehand , that the spot where the only visitor they were aware of had stood , was not yet empty . I want , said Defarge , who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker , to let in a little more light here . You can bear a little more ? The shoemaker stopped his work ; looked with a vacant air of listening , at the floor on one side of him ; then similarly , at the floor on the other side of him ; then , upward at the speaker . 
 What did you say ? You can bear a little more light ? I must bear it , if you let it in . (Laying the palest shadow of a stress upon the second word . The opened half-door was opened a little further , and secured at that angle for the time . A broad ray of light fell into the garret , and showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap , pausing in his labour . His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his feet and on his bench . He had a white beard , raggedly cut , but not very long , a hollow face , and exceedingly bright eyes . 
 The hollowness and thinness of his face would have caused them to look large , under his yet dark eyebrows and his confused white hair , though they had been really otherwise ; but , they were naturally large , and looked unnaturally so . His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat , and showed his body to be withered and worn . He , and his old canvas frock , and his loose stockings , and all his poor tatters of clothes , had , in a long seclusion from direct light and air , faded down to such a dull uniformity of parchment-yellow , that it would have been hard to say which was which . 
 He had put up a hand between his eyes and the light , and the very bones of it seemed transparent . So he sat , with a steadfastly vacant gaze , pausing in his work . He never looked at the figure before him , without first looking down on this side of himself , then on that , as if he had lost the habit of associating place with sound ; he never spoke , without first wandering in this manner , and forgetting to speak . 
 Are you going to finish that pair of shoes to-day ? asked Defarge , motioning to Mr . Lorry to come forward . What did you say ? Do you mean to finish that pair of shoes to-day ? I can't say that I mean to . I suppose so . I don't know . But , the question reminded him of his work , and he bent over it again . Mr . Lorry came silently forward , leaving the daughter by the door . When he had stood , for a minute or two , by the side of Defarge , the shoemaker looked up . He showed no surprise at seeing another figure , but the unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at it (his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead-colour . 
 Then the hand dropped to his work , and he once more bent over the shoe . The look and the action had occupied but an instant . You have a visitor , you see , said Monsieur Defarge . What did you say ? Here is a visitor . The shoemaker looked up as before , but without removing a hand from his work . Come ! said Defarge . Here is monsieur , who knows a well-made shoe when he sees one . Show him that shoe you are working at . Take it , monsieur . Mr . Lorry took it in his hand . 
 Tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is , and the maker's name . There was a longer pause than usual , before the shoemaker replied : I forget what it was you asked me . What did you say ? I said , couldn't you describe the kind of shoe , for monsieur's information ? It is a lady's shoe . It is a young lady's walking-shoe . It is in the present mode . I never saw the mode . I have had a pattern in my hand . He glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride . 
 And the maker's name ? said Defarge . Now that he had no work to hold , he laid the knuckles of the right hand in the hollow of the left , and then the knuckles of the left hand in the hollow of the right , and then passed a hand across his bearded chin , and so on in regular changes , without a moment's intermission . The task of recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he had spoken , was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon , or endeavouring , in the hope of some disclosure , to stay the spirit of a fast-dying man . 
 Did you ask me for my name ? Assuredly I did . One Hundred and Five , North Tower . Is that all ? One Hundred and Five , North Tower . With a weary sound that was not a sigh , nor a groan , he bent to work again , until the silence was again broken . You are not a shoemaker by trade ? said Mr . Lorry , looking steadfastly at him . His haggard eyes turned to Defarge as if he would have transferred the question to him : but as no help came from that quarter , they turned back on the questioner when they had sought the ground . 
 I am not a shoemaker by trade ? No , I was not a shoemaker by trade . I-I learnt it here . I taught myself . I asked leave to. He lapsed away , even for minutes , ringing those measured changes on his hands the whole time . His eyes came slowly back , at last , to the face from which they had wandered ; when they rested on it , he started , and resumed , in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake , reverting to a subject of last night . 
 I asked leave to teach myself , and I got it with much difficulty after a long while , and I have made shoes ever since . As he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him , Mr . Lorry said , still looking steadfastly in his face : Monsieur Manette , do you remember nothing of me ? The shoe dropped to the ground , and he sat looking fixedly at the questioner . Monsieur Manette ; Mr . Lorry laid his hand upon Defarge's arm ; do you remember nothing of this man ? Look at him . Look at me . Is there no old banker , no old business , no old servant , no old time , rising in your mind , Monsieur Manette ?  
 Darkness had fatten on him in its place . He looked at the two , less and less attentively , and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground and looked about him in the old way . Finally , with a deep long sigh , he took the shoe up , and resumed his work . Have you recognised him , monsieur ? asked Defarge in a whisper . Yes ; for a moment . At first I thought it quite hopeless , but I have unquestionably seen , for a single moment , the face that I once knew so well . Hush ! Let us draw further back . Hush ! 
 She had moved from the wall of the garret , very near to the bench on which he sat . There was something awful in his unconsciousness of the figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped over his labour . Not a word was spoken , not a sound was made . She stood , like a spirit , beside him , and he bent over his work . It happened , at length , that he had occasion to change the instrument in his hand , for his shoemaker's knife . It lay on that side of him which was not the side on which she stood . He had taken it up , and was stooping to work again , when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress . He raised them , and saw her face . 
 He stared at her with a fearful look , and after a while his lips began to form some words , though no sound proceeded from them . By degrees , in the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing , he was heard to say : What is this ? With the tears streaming down her face , she put her two hands to her lips , and kissed them to him ; then clasped them on her breast , as if she laid his ruined head there . You are not the gaoler's daughter ? She sighed No . Who are you ? 
 Not yet trusting the tones of her voice , she sat down on the bench beside him . He recoiled , but she laid her hand upon his arm . A strange thrill struck him when she did so , and visibly passed over his frame ; he laid the knife down' softly , as he sat staring at her . Her golden hair , which she wore in long curls , had been hurriedly pushed aside , and fell down over her neck . Advancing his hand by little and little , he took it up and looked at it . In the midst of the action he went astray , and , with another deep sigh , fell to work at his shoemaking . 
 But not for long . Releasing his arm , she laid her hand upon his shoulder . After looking doubtfully at it , two or three times , as if to be sure that it was really there , he laid down his work , put his hand to his neck , and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag attached to it . He opened this , carefully , on his knee , and it contained a very little quantity of hair : not more than one or two long golden hairs , which he had , in some old day , wound off upon his finger . 
 He took her hair into his hand again , and looked closely at it . It is the same . How can it be ! When was it ! How was it ! As the concentrated expression returned to his forehead , he seemed to become conscious that it was in hers too . He turned her full to the light , and looked at her . She had laid her head upon my shoulder , that night when I was summoned outshe had a fear of my going , though I had noneand when I was brought to the North Tower they found these upon my sleeve . ëYou will leave me them ? They can never help me to escape in the body , though they may in the spirit . Those were the words I said . I remember them very well . 
 He formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it . But when he did find spoken words for it , they came to him coherently , though slowly . How was this ? WAS IT YOU ? Once more , the two spectators started , as he turned upon her with a frightful suddenness . But she sat perfectly still in his grasp , and only said , in a low voice , I entreat you , good gentlemen , do not come near us , do not speak , do not move ! 
 Hark ! he exclaimed . Whose voice was that ? His hands released her as he uttered this cry , and went up to his white hair , which they tore in a frenzy . It died out , as everything but his shoemaking did die out of him , and he refolded his little packet and tried to secure it in his breast ; but he still looked at her , and gloomily shook his head . 
 No , no , no ; you are too young , too blooming . It can't be . See what the prisoner is . These are not the hands she knew , this is not the face she knew , this is not a voice she ever heard . No , no . She wasand He wasbefore the slow years of the North Towerages ago . What is your name , my gentle angel ? Hailing his softened tone and manner , his daughter fell upon her knees before him , with her appealing hands upon his breast . 
 O , sir , at another time you shall know my name , and who my mother was , and who my father , and how I never knew their hard , hard history . But I cannot tell you at this time , and I cannot tell you here . All that I may tell you , here and now , is , that I pray to you to touch me and to bless me . Kiss me , kiss me ! O my dear , my dear ! His cold white head mingled with her radiant hair , which warmed and lighted it as though it were the light of Freedom shining on him . 
 If you hear in my voiceI don't know that it is so , but I hope it isif you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was sweet music in your ears , weep for it , weep for it ! If you touch , in touching my hair , anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your breast when you were young and free , weep for it , weep for it ! If , when I hint to you of a Home that is before us , where I will be true to you with all my duty and with all my faithful service , I bring back the remembrance of a Home long desolate , while your poor heart pined away , weep for it , weep for it ! She held him closer round the neck , and rocked him on her breast like a child . 
 If , when I tell you , dearest dear , that your agony is over , and that I have come here to take you from it , and that we go to England to be at peace and at rest , I cause you to think of your useful life laid waste , and of our native France so wicked to you , weep for it , weep for it ! And if , when I shall tell you of my name , and of my father who is living , and of my mother who is dead , you learn that I have to kneel to my honoured father , and implore his pardon for having never for his sake striven all day and lain awake and wept all night , because the love of my poor mother hid his torture from me , weep for it , weep for it ! Weep for her , then , and for me ! Good gentlemen , thank God ! 
 I feel his sacred tears upon my face , and his sobs strike against my heart . O , see ! Thank God for us , thank God ! He had sunk in her arms , and his face dropped on her breast : a sight so touching , yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering which had gone before it , that the two beholders covered their faces . When the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed , and his heaving breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that must follow all stormsemblem to humanity , of the rest and silence into which the storm called Life must hush at lastthey came forward to raise the father and daughter from the ground . He had gradually dropped to the floor , and lay there in a lethargy , worn out . 
 She had nestled down with him , that his head might lie upon her arm ; and her hair drooping over him curtained him from the light . If , without disturbing him , she said , raising her hand to Mr . Lorry as he stooped over them , after repeated blowings of his nose , all could be arranged for our leaving Paris at once , so that , from the , very door , he could be taken away. But , consider . Is he fit for the journey ? asked Mr . Lorry . 
 More fit for that , I think , than to remain in this city , so dreadful to him . It is true , said Defarge , who was kneeling to look on and hear . More than that ; Monsieur Manette is , for all reasons , best out of France . Say , shall I hire a carriage and post-horses ? That's business , said Mr . Lorry , resuming on the shortest notice his methodical manners ; and if business is to be done , I had better do it . Then be so kind , urged Miss Manette , as to leave us here . You see how composed he has become , and you cannot be afraid to leave him with me now . Why should you be ? If you will lock the door to secure us from interruption , I do not doubt that you will find him , when you come back , as quiet as you leave him . 
 In any case , I will take care of him until you return , and then we will remove him straight . Both Mr . Lorry and Defarge were rather disinclined to this course , and in favour of one of them remaining . But , as there were not only carriage and horses to be seen to , but travelling papers ; and as time pressed , for the day was drawing to an end , it came at last to their hastily dividing the business that was necessary to be done , and hurrying away to do it . 
 Then , as the darkness closed in , the daughter laid her head down on the hard ground close at the father's side , and watched him . The darkness deepened and deepened , and they both lay quiet , until a light gleamed through the chinks in the wall . Mr . Lorry and Monsieur Defarge had made all ready for the journey , and had brought with them , besides travelling cloaks and wrappers , bread and meat , wine , and hot coffee . Monsieur Defarge put this provender , and the lamp he carried , on the shoemaker's bench (there was nothing else in the garret but a pallet bed) , and he and Mr . Lorry roused the captive , and assisted him to his feet . 
 No human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind , in the scared blank wonder of his face . Whether he knew what had happened , whether he recollected what they had said to him , whether he knew that he was free , were questions which no sagacity could have solved . They tried speaking to him ; but , he was so confused , and so very slow to answer , that they took fright at his bewilderment , and agreed for the time to tamper with him no more . He had a wild , lost manner of occasionally clasping his head in his hands , that had not been seen in him before ; yet , he had some pleasure in the mere sound of his daughter's voice , and invariably turned to it when she spoke . 
 In the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion , he ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink , and put on the cloak and other wrappings , that they gave him to wear . He readily responded to his daughter's drawing her arm through his , and tookand kepther hand in both his own . They began to descend ; Monsieur Defarge going first with the lamp , Mr . Lorry closing the little procession . They had not traversed many steps of the long main staircase when he stopped , and stared at the roof and round at the wails . 
 You remember the place , my father ? You remember coming up here ?  What did you say ?  But , before she could repeat the question , he murmured an answer as if she had repeated it . Remember ? No , I don't remember . It was so very long ago . That he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought from his prison to that house , was apparent to them . They heard him mutter , One Hundred and Five , North Tower ; and when he looked about him , it evidently was for the strong fortress-walls which had long encompassed him . 
 On their reaching the courtyard he instinctively altered his tread , as being in expectation of a drawbridge ; and when there was no drawbridge , and he saw the carriage waiting in the open street , he dropped his daughter's hand and clasped his head again . No crowd was about the door ; no people were discernible at any of the many windows ; not even a chance passerby was in the street . An unnatural silence and desertion reigned there . Only one soul was to be seen , and that was Madame Defargewho leaned against the door-post , knitting , and saw nothing . 
 The prisoner had got into a coach , and his daughter had followed him , when Mr . Lorry's feet were arrested on the step by his asking , miserably , for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes . Madame Defarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them , and went , knitting , out of the lamplight , through the courtyard . She quickly brought them down and handed them in ; and immediately afterwards leaned against the door-post , knitting , and saw nothing . Defarge got upon the box , and gave the word To the Barrier ! The postilion cracked his whip , and they clattered away under the feeble over-swinging lamps . 
 Under the over-swinging lamps--swinging ever brighter in the better streets , and ever dimmer in the worseand by lighted shops , gay crowds , illuminated coffee-houses , and theatre-doors , to one of the city gates . Soldiers with lanterns , at the guard-house there . Your papers , travellers ! See here then , Monsieur the Officer , said Defarge , getting down , and taking him gravely apart , these are the papers of monsieur inside , with the white head . They were consigned to me , with him , at the He dropped his voice , there was a flutter among the military lanterns , and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm in uniform , the eyes connected with the arm looked , not an every day or an every night look , at monsieur with the white head . 
 Beneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights ; some , so remote from this little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whether their rays have even yet discovered it , as a point in space where anything is suffered or done : the shadows of the night were broad and black . All through the cold and restless interval , until dawn , they once more whispered in the ears of Mr . Jarvis Lorrysitting opposite the buried man who had been dug out , and wondering what subtle powers were for ever lost to him , and what were capable of restorationthe old inquiry :  
 Tellson's Bank by Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place , even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty . It was very small , very dark , very ugly , very incommodious . It was an old-fashioned place , moreover , in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were proud of its smallness , proud of its darkness , proud of its ugliness , proud of its incommodiousness . They were even boastful of its eminence in those particulars , and were fired by an express conviction that , if it were less objectionable , it would be less respectable . This was no passive belief , but an active weapon which they flashed at more convenient places of business .
 Cramped in all kinds of dun cupboards and hutches at Tellson's , the oldest of men carried on the business gravely . When they took a young man into Tellson's London house , they hid him somewhere till he was old . They kept him in a dark place , like a cheese , until he had the full Tellson flavour and blue-mould upon him . Then only was he permitted to be seen , spectacularly poring over large books , and casting his breeches and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment . 
 Outside Tellson'snever by any means in it , unless called inwas an odd-job-man , an occasional porter and messenger , who served as the live sign of the house . He was never absent during business hours , unless upon an errand , and then he was represented by his son : a grisly urchin of twelve , who was his express image . People understood that Tellson's , in a stately way , tolerated the odd-job-man . The house had always tolerated some person in that capacity , and time and tide had drifted this person to the post . His surname was Cruncher , and on the youthful occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness , in the easterly parish church of Hounsditch , he had received the added appellation of Jerry . 
 The scene was Mr . Cruncher's private lodging in Hanging-sword-alley , Whitefriars : the time , half-past seven of the clock on a windy March morning , Anno Domini seventeen hundred and eighty . (Mr . Cruncher himself always spoke of the year of our Lord as Anna Dominoes : apparently under the impression that the Christian era dated from the invention of a popular game , by a lady who had bestowed her name upon it . )
 Mr . Cruncher's apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood , and were but two in number , even if a closet with a single pane of glass in it might be counted as one . But they were very decently kept . Early as it was , on the windy March morning , the room in which he lay abed was already scrubbed throughout ; and between the cups and saucers arranged for breakfast , and the lumbering deal table , a very clean white cloth was spread . 
 Mr . Cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane , like a Harlequin at home . At fast , he slept heavily , but , by degrees , began to roll and surge in bed , until he rose above the surface , with his spiky hair looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons . At which juncture , he exclaimed , in a voice of dire exasperation : 
 Bust me , if she ain't at it agin ! A woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her knees in a corner , with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she was the person referred to . What ! said Mr . Cruncher , looking out of bed for a boot . You're at it agin , are you ? After hailing the mom with this second salutation , he threw a boot at the woman as a third . It was a very muddy boot , and may introduce the odd circumstance connected with Mr . Cruncher's domestic economy , that , whereas he often came home after banking hours with clean boots , he often got up next morning to find the same boots covered with clay . 
 What , said Mr . Cruncher , varying his apostrophe after missing his markwhat are you up to , Aggerawayter ? I was only saying my prayers . Saying your prayers ! You're a nice woman ! What do you mean by flopping yourself down and praying agin me ? I was not praying against you ; I was praying for you . You weren't . And if you were , I won't be took the liberty with . Here ! your mother's a nice woman , young Jerry , going a praying agin your father's prosperity . You've got a dutiful mother , you have , my son . You've got a religious mother , you have , my boy : going and flopping herself down , and praying that the bread-and-butter may be snatched out of the mouth of her only child . 
 Master Cruncher (who was in his shirt) took this very ill , and , turning to his mother , strongly deprecated any praying away of his personal board . And what do you suppose , you conceited female , said Mr . Cruncher , with unconscious inconsistency , that the worth of YOUR prayers may be ? Name the price that you put YOUR prayers at ! They only come from the heart , Jerry . They are worth no more than that . 
 Growling , in addition , such phrases as Ah ! yes ! You're religious , too . You wouldn't put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband and child , would you ? Not you ! and throwing off other sarcastic sparks from the whirling grindstone of his indignation , Mr . Cruncher betook himself to his boot-cleaning and his general preparation for business . In the meantime , his son , whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes , and whose young eyes stood close by one another , as his father's did , kept the required watch upon his mother . He greatly disturbed that poor woman at intervals , by darting out of his sleeping closet , where he made his toilet , with a suppressed cry of You are going to flop , mother . Halloa , father ! and , after raising this fictitious alarm , darting in again with an undutiful grin . 
 Mr . Cruncher's temper was not at all improved when he came to his breakfast . He resented Mrs . Cruncher's saying grace with particular animosity . Now , Aggerawayter ! What are you up to ? At it again ? His wife explained that she had merely asked a blessing . Don't do it ! said Mr . Cruncher looking about , as if he rather expected to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his wife's petitions . I ain't a going to be blest out of house and home . I won't have my wittles blest off my table . Keep still ! 
 Exceedingly red-eyed and grim , as if he had been up all night at a party which had taken anything but a convivial turn , Jerry Cruncher worried his breakfast rather than ate it , growling over it like any four-footed inmate of a menagerie . Towards nine o'clock he smoothed his ruffled aspect , and , presenting as respectable and business-like an exterior as he could overlay his natural self with , issued forth to the occupation of the day . 
 It could scarcely be called a trade , in spite of his favourite description of himself as a honest tradesman . His stock consisted of a wooden stool , made out of a broken-backed chair cut down , which stool , young Jerry , walking at his father's side , carried every morning to beneath the banking-house window that was nearest Temple Bar : where , with the addition of the first handful of straw that could be gleaned from any passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the odd-job-man's feet , it formed the encampment for the day . On this post of his , Mr . Cruncher was as well known to Fleet-street and the Temple , as the Bar itself , and was almost as in-looking . 
 Encamped at a quarter before nine , in good time to touch his three- cornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed in to Tellson's , Jerry took up his station on this windy March morning , with young Jerry standing by him , when not engaged in making forays through the Bar , to inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing boys who were small enough for his amiable purpose . Father and son , extremely like each other , looking silently on at the morning traffic in Fleet-street , with their two heads as near to one another as the two eyes of each were , bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys .
 The head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to Tellson's establishment was put through the door , and the word was given : Porter wanted ! Hooray , father ! Here's an early job to begin with ! Having thus given his parent God speed , young Jerry seated himself on the stool , entered on his reversionary interest in the straw his father had been chewing , and cogitated . Al-ways rusty ! His fingers is al-ways rusty ! muttered young Jerry . Where does my father get all that iron rust from ? He don't get no iron rust here ! 
 You know the Old Bailey , well , no doubt ? said one of the oldest of clerks to Jerry the messenger . Ye-es , sir , returned Jerry , in something of a dogged manner . I DO know the Bailey . Just so . And you know Mr . Lorry . I know Mr . Lorry , sir , much better than I know the Bailey . Much better , said Jerry , not unlike a reluctant witness at the establishment in question , than I , as a honest tradesman , wish to know the Bailey . Very well . Find the door where the witnesses go in , and show the door-keeper this note for Mr . Lorry . He will then let you in . 
 Into the court , sir ? Into the court . Mr . Cruncher's eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another , and to interchange the inquiry , What do you think of this ? Am I to wait in the court , sir ? he asked , as the result of that conference . I am going to tell you . The door-keeper will pass the note to Mr . Lorry , and do you make any gesture that will attract Mr . Lorry's attention , and show him where you stand . Then what you have to do , is , to remain there until he wants you . 
 Is that all , sir ? That's all . He wishes to have a messenger at hand . This is to tell him you are there . As the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note , Mr . Cruncher , after surveying him in silence until he came to the blotting-paper stage , remarked : I suppose they'll be trying Forgeries this morning ? Treason ! That's quartering , said Jerry . Barbarous ! It is the law , remarked the ancient clerk , turning his surprised spectacles upon him . It is the law . It's hard in the law to spile a man , I think . Ifs hard enough to kill him , but it's wery hard to spile him , sir . 
 Not at all , retained the ancient clerk . Speak well of the law . Take care of your chest and voice , my good friend , and leave the law to take care of itself . I give you that advice . It's the damp , sir , what settles on my chest and voice , said Jerry . I leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is . Well , well , said the old clerk ; we all have our various ways of gaining a livelihood . Some of us have damp ways , and some of us have dry ways . Here is the letter . Go along . Jerry took the letter , and , remarking to himself with less internal deference than he made an outward show of , You are a lean old one , too , made his bow , informed his son , in passing , of his destination , and went his way . 
 Making his way through the tainted crowd , dispersed up and down this hideous scene of action , with the skill of a man accustomed to make his way quietly , the messenger found out the door he sought , and handed in his letter through a trap in it . For , people then paid to see the play at the Old Bailey , just as they paid to see the play in Bedlam--only the former entertainment was much the dearer . Therefore , all the Old Bailey doors were well guarded--except , indeed , the social doors by which the criminals got there , and those were always left wide open . 
 After some delay and demur , the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a very little way , and allowed Mr . Jerry Cruncher to squeeze himself into court . What's on ? he asked , in a whisper , of the man he found himself next to . Nothing yet . What's coming on ? The Treason case . The quartering one , eh ? Ah ! returned the man , with a relish ; he'll be drawn on a hurdle to be half hanged , and then he'll be taken down and sliced before his own face , and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks on , and then his head will be chopped off , and he'll be cut into quarters . That's the sentence . If he's found Guilty , you mean to say ? Jerry added , by way of proviso . 
 Mr . Cruncher's attention was here diverted to the door-keeper , whom he saw making his way to Mr . Lorry , with the note in his hand . Mr . Lorry sat at a table , among the gentlemen in wigs : not far from a wigged gentleman , the prisoner's counsel , who had a great bundle of papers before him : and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with his hands in his pockets , whose whole attention , when Mr . Cruncher looked at him then or afterwards , seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the court . After some gruff coughing and rubbing of his chin and signing with his hand , Jerry attracted the notice of Mr . Lorry , who had stood up to look for him , and who quietly nodded and sat down again . 
 What's HE got to do with the case ? asked the man he had spoken with . Blest if I know , said Jerry . What have YOU got to do with it , then , if a person may inquire ? Blest if I know that either , said Jerry . The entrance of the Judge , and a consequent great stir and settling down in the court , stopped the dialogue . Presently , the dock became the central point of interest . Two gaolers , who had been standing there , wont out , and the prisoner was brought in , and put to the bar . 
 Everybody present , except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the ceiling , stared at him . All the human breath in the place , rolled at him , like a sea , or a wind , or a fire . Eager faces strained round pillars and corners , to get a sight of him ; spectators in back rows stood up , not to miss a hair of him ; people on the floor of the court , laid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them , to help themselves , at anybody's cost , to a view of him--stood a-tiptoe , got upon ledges , stood upon next to nothing , to see every inch of him . 
 The object of all this staring and blaring , was a young man of about five-and-twenty , well-grown and well-looking , with a sunburnt cheek and a dark eye . His condition was that of a young gentleman . He was plainly dressed in black , or very dark grey , and his hair , which was long and dark , was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck ; more to be out of his way than for ornament . As an emotion of the mind will express itself through any covering of the body , so the paleness which his situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek , showing the soul to be stronger than the sun . He was otherwise quite self-possessed , bowed to the Judge , and stood quiet . 
 The sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at , was not a sort that elevated humanity . Had he stood in peril of a less horrible sentence--had there been a chance of any one of its savage details being spared--by just so much would he have lost in his fascination . The form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled , was the sight ; the immortal creature that was to be so butchered and torn asunder , yielded the sensation . Whatever gloss the various spectators put upon the interest , according to their several arts and powers of self-deceit , the interest was , at the root of it , Ogreish . 
 The accused , who was (and who knew he was) being mentally hanged , beheaded , and quartered , by everybody there , neither flinched from the situation , nor assumed any theatrical air in it . He was quiet and attentive ; watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest ; and stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him , so composedly , that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which it was strewn . The court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with vinegar , as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever . 
 Over the prisoner's head there was a mirror , to throw the light down upon him . Crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in it , and had passed from its surface and this earth's together . Haunted in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been , if the glass could ever have rendered back its reflections , as the ocean is one day to give up its dead . Some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace for which it had been reserved , may have struck the prisoner's mind . Be that as it may , a change in his position making him conscious of a bar of light across his face , he looked up ; and when he saw the glass his face flushed , and his right hand pushed the herbs away . 
 It happened , that the action turned his face to that side of the court which was on his left . About on a level with his eyes , there sat , in that corner of the Judge's bench , two persons upon whom his look immediately rested ; so immediately , and so much to the changing of his aspect , that all the eyes that were tamed upon him , turned to them . 
 The spectators saw in the two figures , a young lady of little more than twenty , and a gentleman who was evidently her father ; a man of a very remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair , and a certain indescribable intensity of face : not of an active kind , but pondering and self-communing . When this expression was upon him , he looked as if he were old ; but when it was stirred and broken up--as it was now , in a moment , on his speaking to his daughter--he became a handsome man , not past the prime of life . 
 His daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm , as she sat by him , and the other pressed upon it . She had drawn close to him , in her dread of the scene , and in her pity for the prisoner . Her forehead had been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion that saw nothing but the peril of the accused . This had been so very noticeable , so very powerfully and naturally shown , that starers who had had no pity for him were touched by her ; and the whisper went about , Who are they ? 
 Jerry , the messenger , who had made his own observations , in his own manner , and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in his absorption , stretched his neck to hear who they were . The crowd about him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant , and from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back ; at last it got to Jerry : Witnesses . For which side ? Against . Against what side ? The prisoner's . The Judge , whose eyes had gone in the general direction , recalled them , leaned back in his seat , and looked steadily at the man whose life was in his hand , as Mr . Attorney-General rose to spin the rope , grind the axe , and hammer the nails into the scaffold .
