 Many things .
 For instance , returned Madame Defarge , composedly , shrouds .
 The mender of roads was now coming to himself , and was mistrustful of having made a mistake in his late demonstrations .
 but no .
 You are the fellow we want , said Defarge , in his ear .
 you make these fools believe that it will last for ever .
 Then , they are the more insolent , and it is the nearer ended .
 Hey .
 cried the mender of roads , reflectively .
 that's true .
 Madame Defarge looked superciliously at the client , and nodded in confirmation .
 Truly , madame , I think so .
 For the moment .
 Truly yes , madame .
 It is true , madame .
 You have seen both dolls and birds to-day , said Madame Defarge , with a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent .
 now , go home .
 Chateau and hut , stone face and dangling figure , the red stain on the stone floor , and the pure water in the village wellthousands of acres of landa whole province of Franceall France itselflay under the night sky , concentrated into a faint hair-breadth line .
 So does a whole world , with all its greatnesses and littlenesses , lie in a twinkling star .
 And as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse the manner of its composition , so , sublimer intelligences may read in the feeble shining of this earth of ours , every thought and act , every vice and virtue , of every responsible creature on it .
 Say then , my friend .
 what did Jacques of the police tell thee .
 Very little to-night , but all he knows .
 There is another spy commissioned for our quarter .
 There may be many more , for all that he can say , but he knows of one .
 Eh well .
 said Madame Defarge , raising her eyebrows with a cool business air .
 It is necessary to register him .
 How do they call that man .
 He is English .
 So much the better .
 His name .
 Barsad , said Defarge , making it French by pronunciation .
 But , he had been so careful to get it accurately , that he then spelt it with perfect correctness .
 Barsad , repeated madame .
 Good .
 Christian name .
 John .
 Eh my faith .
 It is a portrait .
 said madame , laughing .
 He shall be registered to-morrow .
 The night was hot , and the shop , close shut and surrounded by so foul a neighbourhood , was ill-smelling .
 Monsieur Defarge's olfactory sense was by no means delicate , but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than it ever tasted , and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed .
 He whiffed the compound of scents away , as he put down his smoked-out pipe .
 You are fatigued , said madame , raising her glance as she knotted the money .
 There are only the usual odours .
 I am a little tired , her husband acknowledged .
 You are a little depressed , too , said madame , whose quick eyes had never been so intent on the accounts , but they had had a ray or two for him .
 Oh , the men , the men .
 But my dear .
 began Defarge .
 But my dear .
 repeated madame , nodding firmly .
 but my dear .
 You are faint of heart to-night , my dear .
 It does not take a long time to strike a man with Lightning , said Defarge .
 How long , demanded madame , composedly , does it take to make and store the lightning .
 Tell me .
 Defarge raised his head thoughtfully , as if there were something in that too .
 It does not take a long time , said madame , for an earthquake to swallow a town .
 Eh well .
 Tell me how long it takes to prepare the earthquake .
 A long time , I suppose , said Defarge .
 She tied a knot with flashing eyes , as if it throttled a foe .
 Well .
 said Defarge , with a half complaining and half apologetic shrug .
 We shall not see the triumph .
 We shall have helped it , returned madame , with her extended hand in strong action .
 Nothing that we do , is done in vain .
 I believe , with all my soul , that we shall see the triumph .
 But even if not , even if I knew certainly not , show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrant , and still I would .
 Then madame , with her teeth set , tied a very terrible knot indeed .
 Yes .
 But it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your victim and your opportunity , to sustain you .
 Sustain yourself without that .
 When the time comes , let loose a tiger and a devil .
 but wait for the time with the tiger and the devil chainednot shownyet always ready .
 A figure entering at the door threw a shadow on Madame Defarge which she felt to be a new one .
 She laid down her knitting , and began to pin her rose in her head-dress , before she looked at the figure .
 It was curious .
 The moment Madame Defarge took up the rose , the customers ceased talking , and began gradually to drop out of the wine-shop .
 Good day , madame , said the new-comer .
 Good day , monsieur .
 She said it aloud , but added to herself , as she resumed her knitting : Hah .
 Good day , age about forty , height about five feet nine , black hair , generally rather handsome visage , complexion dark , eyes dark , thin , long and sallow face , aquiline nose but not straight , having a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister expression .
 Good day , one and all .
 Have the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac , and a mouthful of cool fresh water , madame .
 Madame complied with a polite air .
 Marvellous cognac this , madame .
 It was the first time it had ever been so complemented , and Madame Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better .
 She said , however , that the cognac was flattered , and took up her knitting .
 The visitor watched her fingers for a few moments , and took the opportunity of observing the place in general .
 You knit with great skill , madame .
 I am accustomed to it .
 A pretty pattern too .
 YOU think so .
 said madame , looking at him with a smile .
 Decidedly .
 May one ask what it is for .
 Pastime , said madame , still looking at him with a smile while her fingers moved nimbly .
 Not for use .
 It was remarkable .
 but , the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge .
 Two men had entered separately , and had been about to order drink , when , catching sight of that novelty , they faltered , made a pretence of looking about as if for some friend who was not there , and went away .
 Nor , of those who had been there when this visitor entered , was there one left .
 They had all dropped off .
 The spy had kept his eyes open , but had been able to detect no sign .
 They had lounged away in a poverty-stricken , purposeless , accidental manner , quite natural and unimpeachable .
 JOHN , thought madame , checking off her work as her fingers knitted , and her eyes looked at the stranger .
 Stay long enough , and I shall knit BARSAD' before you go .
 You have a husband , madame .
 I have .
 Children .
 No children .
 Business seems bad .
 Business is very bad .
 the people are so poor .
 Ah , the unfortunate , miserable people .
 So oppressed , tooas you say .
 A bad business this , madame , of Gaspard's execution .
 Ah .
 the poor Gaspard .
 With a sigh of great compassion .
 I believe , said the spy , dropping his soft voice to a tone that invited confidence , and expressing an injured revolutionary susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face : I believe there is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood , touching the poor fellow .
 Between ourselves .
 Is there .
 asked madame , vacantly .
 Is there not .
 Here is my husband .
 said Madame Defarge .
 As the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door , the spy saluted him by touching his hat , and saying , with an engaging smile , Good day , Jacques .
 Defarge stopped short , and stared at him .
 Good day , Jacques .
 the spy repeated .
 with not quite so much confidence , or quite so easy a smile under the stare .
 You deceive yourself , monsieur , returned the keeper of the wine-shop .
 You mistake me for another .
 That is not my name .
 I am Ernest Defarge .
 Good day .
 answered Defarge , drily .
 No one has told me so , said Defarge , shaking his head .
 I know nothing of it .
 Not at all , but I hope to know it better .
 I am so profoundly interested in its miserable inhabitants .
 Hah .
 muttered Defarge .
 The pleasure of conversing with you , Monsieur Defarge , recalls to me , pursued the spy , that I have the honour of cherishing some interesting associations with your name .
 Indeed .
 said Defarge , with much indifference .
 Such is the fact , certainly , said Defarge .
 He had had it conveyed to him , in an accidental touch of his wife's elbow as she knitted and warbled , that he would do best to answer , but always with brevity .
 Such is the fact , repeated Defarge .
 Yes .
 said Defarge .
 You don't hear much about them now .
 said the spy .
 No , said Defarge .
 In effect , madame struck in , looking up from her work and her little song , we never hear about them .
 We received the news of their safe arrival , and perhaps another letter , or perhaps two .
 but , since then , they have gradually taken their road in lifewe , oursand we have held no correspondence .
 Perfectly so , madame , replied the spy .
 She is going to be married .
 Going .
 echoed madame .
 She was pretty enough to have been married long ago .
 You English are cold , it seems to me .
 Oh .
 You know I am English .
 I perceive your tongue is , returned madame .
 and what the tongue is , I suppose the man is .
 As he has said it , returned madame , lifting her eyebrows a little , it is probably false .
 But it may be true .
 If it is Defarge began , and stopped .
 If it is .
 repeated his wife .
 And if it does come , while we live to see it triumphI hope , for her sake , Destiny will keep her husband out of France .
 Her husband's destiny , said Madame Defarge , with her usual composure , will take him where he is to go , and will lead him to the end that is to end him .
 That is all I know .
 Stranger things than that will happen when it does come , answered madame .
 I have them both here , of a certainty .
 and they are both here for their merits .
 that is enough .
 She rolled up her knitting when she had said those words , and presently took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her head .
 Either Saint Antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable decoration was gone , or Saint Antoine was on the watch for its disappearance .
 howbeit , the Saint took courage to lounge in , very shortly afterwards , and the wine-shop recovered its habitual aspect .
 But , as the fingers went , the eyes went , and the thoughts .
 And as Madame Defarge moved on from group to group , all three went quicker and fiercer among every little knot of women that she had spoken with , and left behind .
 Never did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in Soho , than one memorable evening when the Doctor and his daughter sat under the plane-tree together .
 Never did the moon rise with a milder radiance over great London , than on that night when it found them still seated under the tree , and shone upon their faces through its leaves .
 Lucie was to be married to-morrow .
 She had reserved this last evening for her father , and they sat alone under the plane-tree .
 You are happy , my dear father .
 Quite , my child .
 They had said little , though they had been there a long time .
 When it was yet light enough to work and read , she had neither engaged herself in her usual work , nor had she read to him .
 She had employed herself in both ways , at his side under the tree , many and many a time .
 but , this time was not quite like any other , and nothing could make it so .
 "And I am very happy to-night , dear father .
 I am deeply happy in the love that Heaven has so blessedmy love for Charles , and Charles's love for me .
 But , if my life were not to be still consecrated to you , or if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us , even by the length of a few of these streets , I should be more unhappy and self-reproachful now than I can tell you .
 Even as it is .
 Even as it was , she could not command her voice .
 In the sad moonlight , she clasped him by the neck , and laid her face upon his breast .
 In the moonlight which is always sad , as the light of the sun itself isas the light called human life isat its coming and its going .
 Dearest dear .
 Can you tell me , this last time , that you feel quite , quite sure , no new affections of mine , and no new duties of mine , will ever interpose between us .
 I know it well , but do you know it .
 In your own heart , do you feel quite certain .
 If I could hope THAT , my father .
 Believe it , love .
 Indeed it is so .
 Consider how natural and how plain it is , my dear , that it should be so .
 You , devoted and young , cannot fully appreciate the anxiety I have felt that your life should not be wasted .
 She moved her hand towards his lips , but he took it in his , and repeated the word .
 If I had never seen Charles , my father , I should have been quite happy with you .
 He smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy without Charles , having seen him .
 and replied : 
 It was the first time , except at the trial , of her ever hearing him refer to the period of his suffering .
 It gave her a strange and new sensation while his words were in her ears .
 and she remembered it long afterwards .
 See .
 said the Doctor of Beauvais , raising his hand towards the moon .
 I have looked at her from my prison-window , when I could not bear her light .
 I have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think of her shining upon what I had lost , that I have beaten my head against my prison-walls .
 I have looked at her , in a state so dun and lethargic , that I have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal lines I could draw across her at the full , and the number of perpendicular lines with which I could intersect them .
 " He added in his inward and pondering manner , as he looked at the moon , "It was twenty either way , I remember , and the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in .
 The strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time , deepened as he dwelt upon it .
 but , there was nothing to shock her in the manner of his reference .
 He only seemed to contrast his present cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over .
 She drew closer to him , and kissed his cheek and his hand .
 My father .
 Even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter who never existed , strikes to my heart as if I had been that child .
 You , Lucie .
 It is out of the Consolation and restoration you have brought to me , that these remembrances arise , and pass between us and the moon on this last night .
 What did I say just now .
 So .
 But on other moonlight nights , when the sadness and the silence have touched me in a different wayhave affected me with something as like a sorrowful sense of peace , as any emotion that had pain for its foundations couldI have imagined her as coming to me in my cell , and leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress .
 I have seen her image in the moonlight often , as I now see you .
 except that I never held her in my arms .
 it stood between the little grated window and the door .
 But , you understand that that was not the child I am speaking of .
 No .
 That was another thing .
 It stood before my disturbed sense of sight , but it never moved .
 The phantom that my mind pursued , was another and more real child .
 Of her outward appearance I know no more than that she was like her mother .
 The other had that likeness tooas you havebut was not the same .
 Can you follow me , Lucie .
 Hardly , I think .
 I doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to understand these perplexed distinctions .
 His collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from running cold , as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition .
 In that more peaceful state , I have imagined her , in the moonlight , coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father .
 My picture was in her room , and I was in her prayers .
 Her life was active , cheerful , useful .
 but my poor history pervaded it all .
 "I am that child , I hope , my father .
 O my dear , my dear , will you bless me as fervently to-morrow .
 He embraced her , solemnly commended her to Heaven , and humbly thanked Heaven for having bestowed her on him .
 By-and-bye , they went into the house .
 There was no one bidden to the marriage but MrLorry .
 there was even to be no bridesmaid but the gaunt Miss Pross .
 The marriage was to make no change in their place of residence .
 they had been able to extend it , by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the apocryphal invisible lodger , and they desired nothing more .
 Doctor Manette was very cheerful at the little supper .
 They were only three at table , and Miss Pross made the third .
 He regretted that Charles was not there .
 was more than half disposed to object to the loving little plot that kept him away .
 and drank to him affectionately .
 All things , however , were in their places .
 all was quiet .
 and he lay asleep , his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow , and his hands lying quiet on the coverlet .
 She put her needless candle in the shadow at a distance , crept up to his bed , and put her lips to his .
 then , leaned over him , and looked at him .
 Into his handsome face , the bitter waters of captivity had worn .
 but , he covered up their tracks with a determination so strong , that he held the mastery of them even in his sleep .
 A more remarkable face in its quiet , resolute , and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant , was not to be beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep , that night .
 She timidly laid her hand on his dear breast , and put up a prayer that she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be , and as his sorrows deserved .
 Then , she withdrew her hand , and kissed his lips once more , and went away .
 So , the sunrise came , and the shadows of the leaves of the plane-tree moved upon his face , as softly as her lips had moved in praying for him .
 And so , said MrLorry , who could not sufficiently admire the bride , and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet , pretty dress .
 and so it was for this , my sweet Lucie , that I brought you across the Channel , such a baby .
 Lord bless me .
 How little I thought what I was doing .
 How lightly I valued the obligation I was conferring on my friend MrCharles .
 You didn't mean it , remarked the matter-of-fact Miss Pross , and therefore how could you know it .
 Nonsense .
 Really .
 Well .
 but don't cry , said the gentle MrLorry .
 I am not crying , said Miss Pross .
 YOU are .
 I , my Pross .
 By this time , MrLorry dared to be pleasant with her , on occasion .
 You were , just now .
 I saw you do it , and I don't wonder at it .
 Such a present of plate as you have made ëem , is enough to bring tears into anybody's eyes .
 There's not a fork or a spoon in the collection , said Miss Pross , that I didn't cry over , last night after the box came , till I couldn't see it .
 Not at all .
 From Miss Pross .
 You think there never might have been a MrsLorry .
 asked the gentleman of that name .
 Pooh .
 rejoined Miss Pross .
 you were a bachelor in your cradle .
 And you were cut out for a bachelor , pursued Miss Pross , before you were put in your cradle .
 He gave his arm to his daughter , and took her down-stairs to the chariot which MrLorry had hired in honour of the day .
 The rest followed in another carriage , and soon , in a neighbouring church , where no strange eyes looked on , Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married .
 It was a hard parting , though it was not for long .
 But her father cheered her , and said at last , gently disengaging himself from her enfolding arms , Take her , Charles .
 She is yours .
 He had naturally repressed much , and some revulsion might have been expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone .
 But , it was the old scared lost look that troubled MrLorry .
 and through his absent manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own room when they got up-stairs , MrLorry was reminded of Defarge the wine-shop keeper , and the starlight ride .
 I think , he whispered to Miss Pross , after anxious consideration , I think we had best not speak to him just now , or at all disturb him .
 I must look in at Tellson's .
 so I will go there at once and come back presently .
 Then , we will take him a ride into the country , and dine there , and all will be well .
 It was easier for MrLorry to look in at Tellson's , than to look out of Tellson's .
 He was detained two hours .
 When he came back , he ascended the old staircase alone , having asked no question of the servant .
 going thus into the Doctor's rooms , he was stopped by a low sound of knocking .
 Good God .
 he said , with a start .
 What's that .
 MrLorry glanced at the work in his hand , and observed that it was a shoe of the old size and shape .
 He took up another that was lying by him , and asked what it was .
 A young lady's walking shoe , he muttered , without looking up .
 It ought to have been finished long ago .
 Let it be .
 He obeyed , in the old mechanically submissive manner , without pausing in his work .
 You know me , my dear friend .
 Think again .
 This is not your proper occupation .
 Think , dear friend .
 These measures , advisable to be taken in any case , MrLorry took in the hope of his coming to himself .
 If that should happen soon , he kept another course in reserve .
 which was , to have a certain opinion that he thought the best , on the Doctor's case .
 In the hope of his recovery , and of resort to this third course being thereby rendered practicable , MrLorry resolved to watch him attentively , with as little appearance as possible of doing so .
 He therefore made arrangements to absent himself from Tellson's for the first time in his life , and took his post by the window in the same room .
 He was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak to him , since , on being pressed , he became worried .
 He abandoned that attempt on the first day , and resolved merely to keep himself always before him , as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had fallen , or was falling .
 He remained , therefore , in his seat near the window , reading and writing , and expressing in as many pleasant and natural ways as he could think of , that it was a free place .
 Will you go out .
 Out .
 Yes .
 for a walk with me .
 Why not .
 When it fell dark again , MrLorry asked him as before : 
 Dear Doctor , will you go out .
 As before , he repeated , Out .
 Worn out by anxious watching , MrLorry fell asleep at his post .
 On The tenth morning of his suspense , he was startled by the shining of the sun into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark night .
 Even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake , MrLorry felt giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might not be a disturbed dream of his own .
 for , did not his eyes show him his friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect , and employed as usual .
 and was there any sign within their range , that the change of which he had so strong an impression had actually happened .
 Within a few minutes , Miss Pross stood whispering at his side .
 If he had had any particle of doubt left , her talk would of necessity have resolved it .
 but he was by that time clear-headed , and had none .
 He advised that they should let the time go by until the regular breakfast-hour , and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual had occurred .
 If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind , MrLorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from the opinion he had been , in his anxiety , so anxious to obtain .
 Miss Pross , submitting herself to his judgment , the scheme was worked out with care .
 Having abundance of time for his usual methodical toilette , MrLorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual white linen , and with his usual neat leg .
 The Doctor was summoned in the usual way , and came to breakfast .
 If I understand , said the Doctor , in a subdued tone , some mental shock .
 Yes .
 Be explicit , said the Doctor .
 Spare no detail .
 MrLorry saw that they understood one another , and proceeded .
 The Doctor , in a low voice , asked , Of how long duration .
 Nine days and nights .
 That is the fact .
 Now , did you ever see him , asked the Doctor , distinctly and collectedly , though in the same low voice , engaged in that pursuit originally .
 Once .
 And when the relapse fell on him , was he in most respectsor in all respectsas he was then .
 I think in all respects .
 You spoke of his daughter .
 Does his daughter know of the relapse .
 No .
 It has been kept from her , and I hope will always be kept from her .
 It is known only to myself , and to one other who may be trusted .
 But I don't know how to originate , in such a case .
 If your sagacity , knowledge , and experience , could put me on the right track , I might be able to do so much .
 unenlightened and undirected , I can do so little .
 Pray discuss it with me .
 pray enable me to see it a little more clearly , and teach me how to be a little more useful .
 I think it probable , said the Doctor , breaking silence with an effort , that the relapse you have described , my dear friend , was not quite unforeseen by its subject .
 Was it dreaded by him .
 MrLorry ventured to ask .
 Very much .
 He said it with an involuntary shudder .
 You have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer's mind , and how difficulthow almost impossibleit is , for him to force himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him .
 Would he , asked MrLorry , be sensibly relieved if he could prevail upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one , when it is on him .
 I think so .
 But it is , as I have told you , next to impossible .
 I even believe itin some casesto be quite impossible .
 Would he remember what took place in the relapse .
 asked MrLorry , with natural hesitation .
 The Doctor looked desolately round the room , shook his head , and answered , in a low voice , Not at all .
 As to the future , said the Doctor , recovering firmness , I should have great hope .
 As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon , I should have great hope .
 He , yielding under the pressure of a complicated something , long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against , and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed , I should hope that the worst was over .
 Well , well .
 That's good comfort .
 I am thankful .
 said MrLorry .
 I am thankful .
 repeated the Doctor , bending his head with reverence .
 There are two other points , said MrLorry , on which I am anxious to be instructed .
 I may go on .
 You cannot do your friend a better service .
 The Doctor gave him his hand .
 I think not .
 It may be the character of his mind , to be always in singular need of occupation .
 That may be , in part , natural to it .
 in part , the result of affliction .
 The less it was occupied with healthy things , the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy direction .
 He may have observed himself , and made the discovery .
 You are sure that he is not under too great a strain .
 I think I am quite sure of it .
 My dear Manette , if he were overworked now .
 The occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction so happily recovered from , said MrLorry , clearing his throat , we will callBlacksmith's work , Blacksmith's work .
 We will say , to put a case and for the sake of illustration , that he had been used , in his bad time , to work at a little forge .
 We will say that he was unexpectedly found at his forge again .
 Is it not a pity that he should keep it by him .
 The Doctor shaded his forehead with his hand , and beat his foot nervously on the ground .
 He has always kept it by him , said MrLorry , with an anxious look at his friend .
 Now , would it not be better that he should let it go .
 Still , the Doctor , with shaded forehead , beat his foot nervously on the ground .
 You do not find it easy to advise me .
 said MrLorry .
 I quite understand it to be a nice question .
 And yet I think And there he shook his head , and stopped .
 He looked like his illustration , as he raised his eyes to MrLorry's face .
 There was another silence .
 You see , too , said the Doctor , tremulously , it is such an old companion .
 I would not keep it , said MrLorry , shaking his head .
 for he gained in firmness as he saw the Doctor disquieted .
 I would recommend him to sacrifice it .
 I only want your authority .
 I am sure it does no good .
 Come .
 Give me your authority , like a dear good man .
 For his daughter's sake , my dear Manette .
 Very strange to see what a struggle there was within him .
 In her name , then , let it be done .
 I sanction it .
 But , I would not take it away while he was present .
 Let it be removed when he is not there .
 let him miss his old companion after an absence .
 He watched his opportunity of taking Darnay aside into a window , and of speaking to him when no one overheard .
 We are already friends , I hope .
 Charles Darnayas was naturalasked him , in all good-humour and good-fellowship , what he did mean .
 I remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to confess that you had been drinking .
 I am not at all alarmed .
 Earnestness in you , is anything but alarming to me .
 Ah .
 said Carton , with a careless wave of his hand , as if he waved that away .
 On the drunken occasion in question one of a large number , as you know , I was insufferable about liking you , and not liking you .
 I wish you would forget it .
 I forgot it long ago .
 Fashion of speech again .
 But , MrDarnay , oblivion is not so easy to me , as you represent it to be to you .
 I have by no means forgotten it , and a light answer does not help me to forget it .
 If it was a light answer , returned Darnay , I beg your forgiveness for it .
 I had no other object than to turn a slight thing , which , to my surprise , seems to trouble you too much , aside .
 I declare to you , on the faith of a gentleman , that I have long dismissed it from my mind .
 Good Heaven , what was there to dismiss .
 Have I had nothing more important to remember , in the great service you rendered me that day .
 As to the great service , said Carton , I am bound to avow to you , when you speak of it in that way , that it was mere professional claptrap , I don't know that I cared what became of you , when I rendered it .
 Mind .
 I say when I rendered it .
 I am speaking of the past .
 I prefer to form my own opinion , without the aid of his .
 Well .
 At any rate you know me as a dissolute dog , who has never done any good , and never will .
 I don't know that you ënever will .
 Will you try .
 That is another way of saying that I am placed on the footing I have indicated .
 I thank you , Darnay .
 I may use that freedom with your name .
 I think so , Carton , by this time .
 They shook hands upon it , and Sydney turned away .
 Within a minute afterwards , he was , to all outward appearance , as unsubstantial as ever .
 He had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young wife .
 but , when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms , he found her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly marked .
 We are thoughtful to-night .
 said Darnay , drawing his arm about her .
 Yes , dearest Charles , with her hands on his breast , and the inquiring and attentive expression fixed upon him .
 we are rather thoughtful to-night , for we have something on our mind to-night .
 What is it , my Lucie .
 Will you promise not to press one question on me , if I beg you not to ask it .
 Will I promise .
 What will I not promise to my Love .
 What , indeed , with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the cheek , and his other hand against the heart that beat for him .
 I think , Charles , poor MrCarton deserves more consideration and respect than you expressed for him to-night .
 Indeed , my own .
 Why so .
 That is what you are not to ask me .
