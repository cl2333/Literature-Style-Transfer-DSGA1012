He took out a blackened pipe , filled it , lighted it with flint and steel , pulled at it until it was in a bright glow : then , suddenly held it from him anddropped something into it from between his finger and thumb , that blazed andwent out in a puff of smoke . 
Touch then . It was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this time , after observing these operations . They again joined hands . 
To-night ? said the mender of roads . 
To-night , said the man , putting the pipe in his mouth . 
Where ? 
Here . 
He and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at oneanother , with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge of bayonets , until the sky began to clear over the village . 
Show me ! said the traveller then , moving to the brow of the hill . 
See ! returned the mender of roads , with extended finger . You go down here , and straight through the street , and past the fountain
To the Devil with all that ! interrupted the other , rolling his eye over thelandscape . I go through no streets and past no fountains . Well ? 
Well ! About two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above thevillage . 
Good . When do you cease to work ? 
At sunset . 
Will you wake me , before departing ? I have walked two nights without resting . Let me finish my pipe , and I shall sleep like a child . Will you wake me ? 
Surely . 
The wayfarer smoked his pipe out , put it in his breast , slipped off his greatwooden shoes , and lay down on his back on the heap of stones . He was fast asleepdirectly . 
As the road-mender plied his dusty labour , and the hail-clouds , rolling away , revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to by silver gleamsupon the landscape , the little man (who wore a red cap now , in place of his blueone) seemed fascinated by the figure on the heap of stones . His eyes were sooften turned towards it , that he used his tools mechanically , and , one wouldhave said , to very poor account . The bronze face , the shaggy black hair andbeard , the coarse woollen red cap , the rough medley dress of home-spun stuff andhairy skins of beasts , the powerful frame attenuated by spare living , and thesullen and desperate compression of the lips in sleep , inspired the mender ofroads with awe . The traveller had travelled far , and his feet were footsore , andhis ankles chafed and bleeding ; his great shoes , stuffed with leaves and grass , had been heavy to drag over the many long leagues , and his clothes were chafedinto holes , as he himself was into sores . Stooping down beside him , theroad-mender tried to get a peep at secret weapons in his breast or where not ; but , in vain , for he slept with his arms crossed upon him , and set as resolutelyas his lips . Fortified towns with their stockades , guard-houses , gates , trenches , and drawbridges , seemed to the mender of roads , to be so much air asagainst this figure . And when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon andlooked around , he saw in his small fancy similar figures , stopped by noobstacle , tending to centres all over France . 
The man slept on , indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of brightness , to sunshine on his face and shadow , to the paltering lumps of dull ice on hisbody and the diamonds into which the sun changed them , until the sun was low inthe west , and the sky was glowing . Then , the mender of roads having got histools together and all things ready to go down into the village , rousedhim . 
Good ! said the sleeper , rising on his elbow . Two leagues beyond the summitof the hill ? 
About . 
About . Good ! 
The mender of roads went home , with the dust going on before him according tothe set of the wind , and was soon at the fountain , squeezing himself in amongthe lean kine brought there to drink , and appearing even to whisper to them inhis whispering to all the village . When the village had taken its poor supper , it did not creep to bed , as it usually did , but came out of doors again , andremained there . A curious contagion of whispering was upon it , and also , when itgathered together at the fountain in the dark , another curious contagion oflooking expectantly at the sky in one direction only . Monsieur Gabelle , chieffunctionary of the place , became uneasy ; went out on his house-top alone , andlooked in that direction too ; glanced down from behind his chimneys at thedarkening faces by the fountain below , and sent word to the sacristan who keptthe keys of the church , that there might be need to ring the tocsinby-and-bye . 
The night deepened . The trees environing the old chateau , keeping its solitarystate apart , moved in a rising wind , as though they threatened the pile ofbuilding massive and dark in the gloom . Up the two terrace flights of steps therain ran wildly , and beat at the great door , like a swift messenger rousingthose within ; uneasy rushes of wind went through the hall , among the old spearsand knives , and passed lamenting up the stairs , and shook the curtains of thebed where the last Marquis had slept . East , West , North , and South , through thewoods , four heavy-treading , unkempt figures crushed the high grass and crackedthe branches , striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard . Fourlights broke out there , and moved away in different directions , and all wasblack again . 
But , not for long . Presently , the chateau began to make itself strangelyvisible by some light of its own , as though it were growing luminous . Then , aflickering streak played behind the architecture of the front , picking outtransparent places , and showing where balustrades , arches , and windows were . Then it soared higher , and grew broader and brighter . Soon , from a score of thegreat windows , flames burst forth , and the stone faces awakened , stared out offire . 
A faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left there , and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away . There was spurring andsplashing through the darkness , and bridle was drawn in the space by the villagefountain , and the horse in a foam stood at Monsieur Gabelle's door . Help , Gabelle ! Help , every one ! The tocsin rang impatiently , but other help (if thatwere any) there was none . The mender of roads , and two hundred and fiftyparticular friends , stood with folded arms at the fountain , looking at thepillar of fire in the sky . It must be forty feet high , said they , grimly ; andnever moved . 
The rider from the chateau , and the horse in a foam , clattered away throughthe village , and galloped up the stony steep , to the prison on the crag . At thegate , a group of officers were looking at the fire ; removed from them , a groupof soldiers . Help , gentlemenofficers ! The chateau is on fire ; valuable objectsmay be saved from the flames by timely aid ! Help , help ! The officers lookedtowards the soldiers who looked at the fire ; gave no orders ; and answered , withshrugs and biting of lips , It must burn . 
As the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street , the villagewas illuminating . The mender of roads , and the two hundred and fifty particularfriends , inspired as one man and woman by the idea of lighting up , had dartedinto their houses , and were putting candles in every dull little pane of glass . The general scarcity of everything , occasioned candles to be borrowed in arather peremptory manner of Monsieur Gabelle ; and in a moment of reluctance andhesitation on that functionary's part , the mender of roads , once so submissiveto authority , had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with , andthat post-horses would roast . 
The chateau was left to itself to flame and burn . In the roaring and raging ofthe conflagration , a red-hot wind , driving straight from the infernal regions , seemed to be blowing the edifice away . With the rising and falling of the blaze , the stone faces showed as if they were in torment . When great masses of stoneand timber fell , the face with the two dints in the nose became obscured : anonstruggled out of the smoke again , as if it were the face of the cruel Marquis , burning at the stake and contending with the fire . 
The chateau burned ; the nearest trees , laid hold of by the fire , scorched andshrivelled ; trees at a distance , fired by the four fierce figures , begirt theblazing edifice with a new forest of smoke . Molten lead and iron boiled in themarble basin of the fountain ; the water ran dry ; the extinguisher tops of thetowers vanished like ice before the heat , and trickled down into four ruggedwells of flame . Great rents and splits branched out in the solid walls , likecrystallisation ; stupefied birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace ; four fierce figures trudged away , East , West , North , and South , along thenight-enshrouded roads , guided by the beacon they had lighted , towards theirnext destination . The illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin , and , abolishing the lawful ringer , rang for joy . 
Not only that ; but the village , light-headed with famine , fire , andbell-ringing , and bethinking itself that Monsieur Gabelle had to do with thecollection of rent and taxesthough it was but a small instalment of taxes , andno rent at all , that Gabelle had got in those latter daysbecame impatient foran interview with him , and , surrounding his house , summoned him to come forthfor personal conference . Whereupon , Monsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his door , and retire to hold counsel with himself . The result of that conference was , thatGabelle again withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys ; this time resolved , if his door were broken in (he was a small Southern man ofretaliative temperament) , to pitch himself head foremost over the parapet , andcrush a man or two below . 
Probably , Monsieur Gabelle passed a long night up there , with the distantchateau for fire and candle , and the beating at his door , combined with thejoy-ringing , for music ; not to mention his having an ill-omened lamp slungacross the road before his posting-house gate , which the village showed a livelyinclination to displace in his favour . A trying suspense , to be passing a wholesummer night on the brink of the black ocean , ready to take that plunge into itupon which Monsieur Gabelle had resolved ! But , the friendly dawn appearing atlast , and the rush-candles of the village guttering out , the people happilydispersed , and Monsieur Gabelle came down bringing his life with him for thatwhile . 
Within a hundred miles , and in the light of other fires , there were otherfunctionaries less fortunate , that night and other nights , whom the rising sunfound hanging across once-peaceful streets , where they had been born and bred ; also , there were other villagers and townspeople less fortunate than the menderof roads and his fellows , upon whom the functionaries and soldiery turned withsuccess , and whom they strung up in their turn . But , the fierce figures weresteadily wending East , West , North , and South , be that as it would ; andwhosoever hung , fire burned . The altitude of the gallows that would turn towater and quench it , no functionary , by any stretch of mathematics , was able tocalculate successfully . 
In such risings of fire and risings of seathe firm earth shaken by the rushesof an angry ocean which had now no ebb , but was always on the flow , higher andhigher , to the terror and wonder of the beholders on the shorethree years oftempest were consumed . Three more birthdays of little Lucie had been woven bythe golden thread into the peaceful tissue of the life of her home . 
Many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in thecorner , with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging feet . For , the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of a people , tumultuousunder a red flag and with their country declared in danger , changed into wildbeasts , by terrible enchantment long persisted in . 
Monseigneur , as a class , had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of hisnot being appreciated : of his being so little wanted in France , as to incurconsiderable danger of receiving his dismissal from it , and this life together . Like the fabled rustic who raised the Devil with infinite pains , and was soterrified at the sight of him that he could ask the Enemy no question , butimmediately fled ; so , Monseigneur , after boldly reading the Lord's Prayerbackwards for a great number of years , and performing many other potent spellsfor compelling the Evil One , no sooner beheld him in his terrors than he took tohis noble heels . 
The shining Bull's Eye of the Court was gone , or it would have been the markfor a hurricane of national bullets . It had never been a good eye to seewithhad long had the mote in it of Lucifer's pride , Sardanapalus's luxury , anda mole's blindnessbut it had dropped out and was gone . The Court , from thatexclusive inner circle to its outermost rotten ring of intrigue , corruption , anddissimulation , was all gone together . Royalty was gone ; had been besieged in itsPalace and suspended , when the last tidings came over . 
The August of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two was come , andMonseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide . 
As was natural , the head-quarters and great gathering-place of Monseigneur , inLondon , was Tellson's Bank . Spirits are supposed to haunt the places where theirbodies most resorted , and Monseigneur without a guinea haunted the spot wherehis guineas used to be . Moreover , it was the spot to which such Frenchintelligence as was most to be relied upon , came quickest . Again : Tellson's wasa munificent house , and extended great liberality to old customers who hadfallen from their high estate . Again : those nobles who had seen the coming stormin time , and anticipating plunder or confiscation , had made providentremittances to Tellson's , were always to be heard of there by their needybrethren . To which it must be added that every new-comer from France reportedhimself and his tidings at Tellson's , almost as a matter of course . For suchvariety of reasons , Tellson's was at that time , as to French intelligence , akind of High Exchange ; and this was so well known to the public , and theinquiries made there were in consequence so numerous , that Tellson's sometimeswrote the latest news out in a line or so and posted it in the Bank windows , forall who ran through Temple Bar to read . 
On a steaming , misty afternoon , Mr . Lorry sat at his desk , and Charles Darnaystood leaning on it , talking with him in a low voice . The penitential den onceset apart for interviews with the House , was now the news-Exchange , and wasfilled to overflowing . It was within half an hour or so of the time ofclosing . 
But , although you are the youngest man that ever lived , said Charles Darnay , rather hesitating , I must still suggest to you
I understand . That I am too old ? said Mr . Lorry . 
Unsettled weather , a long journey , uncertain means of travelling , adisorganised country , a city that may not be even safe for you . 
My dear Charles , said Mr . Lorry , with cheerful confidence , you touch someof the reasons for my going : not for my staying away . It is safe enough for me ; nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard upon fourscore whenthere are so many people there much better worth interfering with . As to itsbeing a disorganised city , if it were not a disorganised city there would be nooccasion to send somebody from our House here to our House there , who knows thecity and the business , of old , and is in Tellson's confidence . As to theuncertain travelling , the long journey , and the winter weather , if I were notprepared to submit myself to a few inconveniences for the sake of Tellson's , after all these years , who ought to be ? 
I wish I were going myself , said Charles Darnay , somewhat restlessly , andlike one thinking aloud . 
Indeed ! You are a pretty fellow to object and advise ! exclaimed Mr . Lorry . You wish you were going yourself ? And you a Frenchman born ? You are a wisecounsellor . 
My dear Mr . Lorry , it is because I am a Frenchman born , that the thought(which I did not mean to utter here , however) has passed through my mind often . One cannot help thinking , having had some sympathy for the miserable people , andhaving abandoned something to them , he spoke here in his former thoughtfulmanner , that one might be listened to , and might have the power to persuade tosome restraint . Only last night , after you had left us , when I was talking toLucie
When you were talking to Lucie , Mr . Lorry repeated . Yes . I wonder you arenot ashamed to mention the name of Lucie ! Wishing you were going to France atthis time of day ! 
However , I am not going , said Charles Darnay , with a smile . It is more tothe purpose that you say you are . 
And I am , in plain reality . The truth is , my dear Charles , Mr . Lorry glancedat the distant House , and lowered his voice , you can have no conception of thedifficulty with which our business is transacted , and of the peril in which ourbooks and papers over yonder are involved . The Lord above knows what thecompromising consequences would be to numbers of people , if some of ourdocuments were seized or destroyed ; and they might be , at any time , you know , for who can say that Paris is not set afire to-day , or sacked to-morrow ! Now , ajudicious selection from these with the least possible delay , and the burying ofthem , or otherwise getting of them out of harm's way , is within the power(without loss of precious time) of scarcely any one but myself , if any one . Andshall I hang back , when Tellson's knows this and says thisTellson's , whosebread I have eaten these sixty yearsbecause I am a little stiff about thejoints ? Why , I am a boy , sir , to half a dozen old codgers here ! 
How I admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit , Mr . Lorry . 
Tut ! Nonsense , sir ! And , my dear Charles , said Mr . Lorry , glancing at theHouse again , you are to remember , that getting things out of Paris at thispresent time , no matter what things , is next to an impossibility . Papers andprecious matters were this very day brought to us here (I speak in strictconfidence ; it is not business-like to whisper it , even to you) , by thestrangest bearers you can imagine , every one of whom had his head hanging on bya single hair as he passed the Barriers . At another time , our parcels would comeand go , as easily as in business-like Old England ; but now , everything isstopped . 
And do you really go to-night ? 
I really go to-night , for the case has become too pressing to admit ofdelay . 
And do you take no one with you ? 
All sorts of people have been proposed to me , but I will have nothing to sayto any of them . I intend to take Jerry . Jerry has been my bodyguard on Sundaynights for a long time past and I am used to him . Nobody will suspect Jerry ofbeing anything but an English bull-dog , or of having any design in his head butto fly at anybody who touches his master . 
I must say again that I heartily admire your gallantry andyouthfulness . 
I must say again , nonsense , nonsense ! When I have executed this littlecommission , I shall , perhaps , accept Tellson's proposal to retire and live at myease . Time enough , then , to think about growing old . 
This dialogue had taken place at Mr . Lorry's usual desk , with Monseigneurswarming within a yard or two of it , boastful of what he would do to avengehimself on the rascal-people before long . It was too much the way of Monseigneurunder his reverses as a refugee , and it was much too much the way of nativeBritish orthodoxy , to talk of this terrible Revolution as if it were the onlyharvest ever known under the skies that had not been sownas if nothing had everbeen done , or omitted to be done , that had led to itas if observers of thewretched millions in France , and of the misused and perverted resources thatshould have made them prosperous , had not seen it inevitably coming , yearsbefore , and had not in plain words recorded what they saw . Such vapouring , combined with the extravagant plots of Monseigneur for the restoration of astate of things that had utterly exhausted itself , and worn out Heaven and earthas well as itself , was hard to be endured without some remonstrance by any saneman who knew the truth . And it was such vapouring all about his ears , like atroublesome confusion of blood in his own head , added to a latent uneasiness inhis mind , which had already made Charles Darnay restless , and which still kepthim so . 
Among the talkers , was Stryver , of the King's Bench Bar , far on his way tostate promotion , and , therefore , loud on the theme : broaching to Monseigneur , his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating them from the face ofthe earth , and doing without them : and for accomplishing many similar objectsakin in their nature to the abolition of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tailsof the race . Him , Darnay heard with a particular feeling of objection ; andDarnay stood divided between going away that he might hear no more , andremaining to interpose his word , when the thing that was to be , went on to shapeitself out . 
The House approached Mr . Lorry , and laying a soiled and unopened letter beforehim , asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to whom it wasaddressed ? The House laid the letter down so close to Darnay that he saw thedirectionthe more quickly because it was his own right name . The address , turned into English , ran : 
Very pressing . To Monsieur heretofore the Marquis St . Evremonde , of France . Confided to the cares of Messrs . Tellson and Co . , Bankers , London , England . 
On the marriage morning , Doctor Manette had made it his one urgent and expressrequest to Charles Darnay , that the secret of this name should beunless he , theDoctor , dissolved the obligationkept inviolate between them . Nobody else knewit to be his name ; his own wife had no suspicion of the fact ; Mr . Lorry couldhave none . 
No , said Mr . Lorry , in reply to the House ; I have referred it , I think , toeverybody now here , and no one can tell me where this gentleman is to befound . 
The hands of the clock verging upon the hour of closing the Bank , there was ageneral set of the current of talkers past Mr . Lorry's desk . He held the letterout inquiringly ; and Monseigneur looked at it , in the person of this plottingand indignant refugee ; and Monseigneur looked at it in the person of thatplotting and indignant refugee ; and This , That , and The Other , all had somethingdisparaging to say , in French or in English , concerning the Marquis who was notto be found . 
Nephew , I believebut in any case degenerate successorof the polishedMarquis who was murdered , said one . Happy to say , I never knew him . 
A craven who abandoned his post , said anotherthis Monseigneur had been gotout of Paris , legs uppermost and half suffocated , in a load of haysome yearsago . 
Infected with the new doctrines , said a third , eyeing the direction throughhis glass in passing ; set himself in opposition to the last Marquis , abandonedthe estates when he inherited them , and left them to the ruffian herd . They willrecompense him now , I hope , as he deserves . 
Hey ? cried the blatant Stryver . Did he though ? Is that the sort of fellow ? Let us look at his infamous name . Dn the fellow ! 
Darnay , unable to restrain himself any longer , touched Mr . Stryver on theshoulder , and said : 
I know the fellow . 
Do you , by Jupiter ? said Stryver . I am sorry for it . 
Why ? 
Why , Mr . Darnay ? D'ye hear what he did ? Don't ask , why , in thesetimes . 
But I do ask why ? 
Then I tell you again , Mr . Darnay , I am sorry for it . I am sorry to hear youputting any such extraordinary questions . Here is a fellow , who , infected by themost pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry that ever was known , abandonedhis property to the vilest scum of the earth that ever did murder by wholesale , and you ask me why I am sorry that a man who instructs youth knows him ? Well , but I'll answer you . I am sorry because I believe there is contamination in sucha scoundrel . That's why . 
Mindful of the secret , Darnay with great difficulty checked himself , and said : You may not understand the gentleman . 
I understand how to put YOU in a corner , Mr . Darnay , said Bully Stryver , and I'll do it . If this fellow is a gentleman , I DON'T understand him . You maytell him so , with my compliments . You may also tell him , from me , that afterabandoning his worldly goods and position to this butcherly mob , I wonder he isnot at the head of them . But , no , gentlemen , said Stryver , looking all round , and snapping his fingers , I know something of human nature , and I tell you thatyou'll never find a fellow like this fellow , trusting himself to the mercies ofsuch precious PROTEGES . No , gentlemen ; he'll always show em a clean pair ofheels very early in the scuffle , and sneak away . 
With those words , and a final snap of his fingers , Mr . Stryver shoulderedhimself into Fleet-street , amidst the general approbation of his hearers . Mr . Lorry and Charles Darnay were left alone at the desk , in the general departurefrom the Bank . 
Will you take charge of the letter ? said Mr . Lorry . You know where todeliver it ? 
I do . 
Will you undertake to explain , that we suppose it to have been addressedhere , on the chance of our knowing where to forward it , and that it has beenhere some time ? 
I will do so . Do you start for Paris from here ? 
From here , at eight . 
I will come back , to see you off . 
Very ill at ease with himself , and with Stryver and most other men , Darnaymade the best of his way into the quiet of the Temple , opened the letter , andread it . These were its contents : 
Prison of the Abbaye , Paris . 
June 21 , 1792 . 
MONSIEUR HERETOFORE THE MARQUIS . 
After having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the village , Ihave been seized , with great violence and indignity , and brought a long journeyon foot to Paris . On the road I have suffered a great deal . Nor is that all ; myhouse has been destroyedrazed to the ground . 
The crime for which I am imprisoned , Monsieur heretofore the Marquis , and forwhich I shall be summoned before the tribunal , and shall lose my life (withoutyour so generous help) , is , they tell me , treason against the majesty of thepeople , in that I have acted against them for an emigrant . It is in vain Irepresent that I have acted for them , and not against , according to yourcommands . It is in vain I represent that , before the sequestration of emigrantproperty , I had remitted the imposts they had ceased to pay ; that I hadcollected no rent ; that I had had recourse to no process . The only response is , that I have acted for an emigrant , and where is that emigrant ? 
Ah ! most gracious Monsieur heretofore the Marquis , where is that emigrant ? Icry in my sleep where is he ? I demand of Heaven , will he not come to deliver me ? No answer . Ah Monsieur heretofore the Marquis , I send my desolate cry across thesea , hoping it may perhaps reach your ears through the great bank of Tilsonknown at Paris ! 
For the love of Heaven , of justice , of generosity , of the honour of yournoble name , I supplicate you , Monsieur heretofore the Marquis , to succour andrelease me . My fault is , that I have been true to you . Oh Monsieur heretoforethe Marquis , I pray you be you true to me ! 
From this prison here of horror , whence I every hour tend nearer and nearerto destruction , I send you , Monsieur heretofore the Marquis , the assurance of mydolorous and unhappy service . 
Your afflicted , 
Gabelle . 
The latent uneasiness in Darnay's mind was roused to vigourous life by thisletter . The peril of an old servant and a good one , whose only crime wasfidelity to himself and his family , stared him so reproachfully in the face , that , as he walked to and fro in the Temple considering what to do , he almosthid his face from the passersby . 
He knew very well , that in his horror of the deed which had culminated the baddeeds and bad reputation of the old family house , in his resentful suspicions ofhis uncle , and in the aversion with which his conscience regarded the crumblingfabric that he was supposed to uphold , he had acted imperfectly . He knew verywell , that in his love for Lucie , his renunciation of his social place , thoughby no means new to his own mind , had been hurried and incomplete . He knew thathe ought to have systematically worked it out and supervised it , and that he hadmeant to do it , and that it had never been done . 
The happiness of his own chosen English home , the necessity of being alwaysactively employed , the swift changes and troubles of the time which had followedon one another so fast , that the events of this week annihilated the immatureplans of last week , and the events of the week following made all new again ; heknew very well , that to the force of these circumstances he had yielded : notwithout disquiet , but still without continuous and accumulating resistance . Thathe had watched the times for a time of action , and that they had shifted andstruggled until the time had gone by , and the nobility were trooping from Franceby every highway and byway , and their property was in course of confiscation anddestruction , and their very names were blotting out , was as well known tohimself as it could be to any new authority in France that might impeach him forit . 
But , he had oppressed no man , he had imprisoned no man ; he was so far fromhaving harshly exacted payment of his dues , that he had relinquished them of hisown will , thrown himself on a world with no favour in it , won his own privateplace there , and earned his own bread . Monsieur Gabelle had held theimpoverished and involved estate on written instructions , to spare the people , to give them what little there was to givesuch fuel as the heavy creditorswould let them have in the winter , and such produce as could be saved from thesame grip in the summerand no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof , forhis own safety , so that it could not but appear now . 
This favoured the desperate resolution Charles Darnay had begun to make , thathe would go to Paris . 
Yes . Like the mariner in the old story , the winds and streams had driven himwithin the influence of the Loadstone Rock , and it was drawing him to itself , and he must go . Everything that arose before his mind drifted him on , faster andfaster , more and more steadily , to the terrible attraction . His latentuneasiness had been , that bad aims were being worked out in his own unhappy landby bad instruments , and that he who could not fail to know that he was betterthan they , was not there , trying to do something to stay bloodshed , and assertthe claims of mercy and humanity . With this uneasiness half stifled , and halfreproaching him , he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself withthe brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong ; upon that comparison(injurious to himself) had instantly followed the sneers of Monseigneur , whichhad stung him bitterly , and those of Stryver , which above all were coarse andgalling , for old reasons . Upon those , had followed Gabelle's letter : the appealof an innocent prisoner , in danger of death , to his justice , honour , and goodname . 
His resolution was made . He must go to Paris . 
Yes . The Loadstone Rock was drawing him , and he must sail on , until he struck . He knew of no rock ; he saw hardly any danger . The intention with which he haddone what he had done , even although he had left it incomplete , presented itbefore him in an aspect that would be gratefully acknowledged in France on hispresenting himself to assert it . Then , that glorious vision of doing good , whichis so often the sanguine mirage of so many good minds , arose before him , and heeven saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this ragingRevolution that was running so fearfully wild . 
As he walked to and fro with his resolution made , he considered that neitherLucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone . Lucie should be sparedthe pain of separation ; and her father , always reluctant to turn his thoughtstowards the dangerous ground of old , should come to the knowledge of the step , as a step taken , and not in the balance of suspense and doubt . How much of theincompleteness of his situation was referable to her father , through the painfulanxiety to avoid reviving old associations of France in his mind , he did notdiscuss with himself . But , that circumstance too , had had its influence in hiscourse . 
He walked to and fro , with thoughts very busy , until it was time to return toTellson's and take leave of Mr . Lorry . As soon as he arrived in Paris he wouldpresent himself to this old friend , but he must say nothing of his intentionnow . 
A carriage with post-horses was ready at the Bank door , and Jerry was bootedand equipped . 
I have delivered that letter , said Charles Darnay to Mr . Lorry . I would notconsent to your being charged with any written answer , but perhaps you will takea verbal one ? 
That I will , and readily , said Mr . Lorry , if it is not dangerous . 
Not at all . Though it is to a prisoner in the Abbaye . 
What is his name ? said Mr . Lorry , with his open pocket-book in hishand . 
Gabelle . 
Gabelle . And what is the message to the unfortunate Gabelle inprison ? 
Simply , that he has received the letter , and will come . '
Any time mentioned ? 
He will start upon his journey to-morrow night . 
Any person mentioned ? 
No . 
He helped Mr . Lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks , and wentout with him from the warm atmosphere of the old Bank , into the misty air ofFleet-street . My love to Lucie , and to little Lucie , said Mr . Lorry atparting , and take precious care of them till I come back . Charles Darnay shookhis head and doubtfully smiled , as the carriage rolled away . 
That nightit was the fourteenth of Augusthe sat up late , and wrote twofervent letters ; one was to Lucie , explaining the strong obligation he was underto go to Paris , and showing her , at length , the reasons that he had , for feelingconfident that he could become involved in no personal danger there ; the otherwas to the Doctor , confiding Lucie and their dear child to his care , anddwelling on the same topics with the strongest assurances . To both , he wrotethat he would despatch letters in proof of his safety , immediately after hisarrival . 
It was a hard day , that day of being among them , with the first reservation oftheir joint lives on his mind . It was a hard matter to preserve the innocentdeceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious . But , an affectionate glanceat his wife , so happy and busy , made him resolute not to tell her what impended(he had been half moved to do it , so strange it was to him to act in anythingwithout her quiet aid) , and the day passed quickly . Early in the evening heembraced her , and her scarcely less dear namesake , pretending that he wouldreturn by-and-bye (an imaginary engagement took him out , and he had secreted avalise of clothes ready) , and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavystreets , with a heavier heart . 
The unseen force was drawing him fast to itself , now , and all the tides andwinds were setting straight and strong towards it . He left his two letters witha trusty porter , to be delivered half an hour before midnight , and no sooner ; took horse for Dover ; and began his journey . For the love of Heaven , ofjustice , of generosity , of the honour of your noble name ! was the poorprisoner's cry with which he strengthened his sinking heart , as he left all thatwas dear on earth behind him , and floated away for the Loadstone Rock . 
The end of the second book . 
The traveller fared slowly on his way , who fared towards Paris from England inthe autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two . More thanenough of bad roads , bad equipages , and bad horses , he would have encountered todelay him , though the fallen and unfortunate King of France had been upon histhrone in all his glory ; but , the changed times were fraught with otherobstacles than these . Every town-gate and village taxing-house had its band ofcitizen-patriots , with their national muskets in a most explosive state ofreadiness , who stopped all comers and goers , cross-questioned them , inspectedtheir papers , looked for their names in lists of their own , turned them back , orsent them on , or stopped them and laid them in hold , as their capriciousjudgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning Republic One and Indivisible , ofLiberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death . 
A very few French leagues of his journey were accomplished , when CharlesDarnay began to perceive that for him along these country roads there was nohope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen at Paris . Whatever might befall now , he must on to his journey's end . Not a mean villageclosed upon him , not a common barrier dropped across the road behind him , but heknew it to be another iron door in the series that was barred between him andEngland . The universal watchfulness so encompassed him , that if he had beentaken in a net , or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage , he couldnot have felt his freedom more completely gone . 
This universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty timesin a stage , but retarded his progress twenty times in a day , by riding after himand taking him back , riding before him and stopping him by anticipation , ridingwith him and keeping him in charge . He had been days upon his journey in Francealone , when he went to bed tired out , in a little town on the high road , still along way from Paris . 
Nothing but the production of the afflicted Gabelle's letter from his prisonof the Abbaye would have got him on so far . His difficulty at the guard-house inthis small place had been such , that he felt his journey to have come to acrisis . And he was , therefore , as little surprised as a man could be , to findhimself awakened at the small inn to which he had been remitted until morning , in the middle of the night . 
Awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough redcaps and with pipes in their mouths , who sat down on the bed . 
Emigrant , said the functionary , I am going to send you on to Paris , underan escort . 
Citizen , I desire nothing more than to get to Paris , though I could dispensewith the escort . 
Silence ! growled a red-cap , striking at the coverlet with the butt-end ofhis musket . Peace , aristocrat ! 
It is as the good patriot says , observed the timid functionary . You are anaristocrat , and must have an escortand must pay for it . 
I have no choice , said Charles Darnay . 
Choice ! Listen to him ! cried the same scowling red-cap . As if it was not afavour to be protected from the lamp-iron ! 
It is always as the good patriot says , observed the functionary . Rise anddress yourself , emigrant . 
Darnay complied , and was taken back to the guard-house , where other patriotsin rough red caps were smoking , drinking , and sleeping , by a watch-fire . Here hepaid a heavy price for his escort , and hence he started with it on the wet , wetroads at three o'clock in the morning . 
The escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri-coloured cockades , armed with national muskets and sabres , who rode one on either side ofhim . 
The escorted governed his own horse , but a loose line was attached to hisbridle , the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round his wrist . Inthis state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their faces : clatteringat a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement , and out upon themire-deep roads . In this state they traversed without change , except of horsesand pace , all the mire-deep leagues that lay between them and thecapital . 
They travelled in the night , halting an hour or two after daybreak , and lyingby until the twilight fell . The escort were so wretchedly clothed , that theytwisted straw round their bare legs , and thatched their ragged shoulders to keepthe wet off . Apart from the personal discomfort of being so attended , and apartfrom such considerations of present danger as arose from one of the patriotsbeing chronically drunk , and carrying his musket very recklessly , Charles Darnaydid not allow the restraint that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fearsin his breast ; for , he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference tothe merits of an individual case that was not yet stated , and ofrepresentations , confirmable by the prisoner in the Abbaye , that were not yetmade . 
But when they came to the town of Beauvaiswhich they did at eventide , whenthe streets were filled with peoplehe could not conceal from himself that theaspect of affairs was very alarming . An ominous crowd gathered to see himdismount of the posting-yard , and many voices called out loudly , Down with theemigrant ! 
He stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle , and , resuming itas his safest place , said : 
Emigrant , my friends ! Do you not see me here , in France , of my ownwill ? 
You are a cursed emigrant , cried a farrier , making at him in a furiousmanner through the press , hammer in hand ; and you are a cursedaristocrat ! 
The postmaster interposed himself between this man and the rider's bridle (atwhich he was evidently making) , and soothingly said , Let him be ; let him be ! Hewill be judged at Paris . 
Judged ! repeated the farrier , swinging his hammer . Ay ! and condemned as atraitor . At this the crowd roared approval . 
Checking the postmaster , who was for turning his horse's head to the yard (thedrunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on , with the line round hiswrist) , Darnay said , as soon as he could make his voice heard : 
Friends , you deceive yourselves , or you are deceived . I am not atraitor . 
He lies ! cried the smith . He is a traitor since the decree . His life isforfeit to the people . His cursed life is not his own ! 
At the instant when Darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd , which anotherinstant would have brought upon him , the postmaster turned his horse into theyard , the escort rode in close upon his horse's flanks , and the postmaster shutand barred the crazy double gates . The farrier struck a blow upon them with hishammer , and the crowd groaned ; but , no more was done . 
What is this decree that the smith spoke of ? Darnay asked the postmaster , when he had thanked him , and stood beside him in the yard . 
Truly , a decree for selling the property of emigrants . 
When passed ? 
On the fourteenth . 
The day I left England ! 
Everybody says it is but one of several , and that there will be othersifthere are not alreadybanishing all emigrants , and condemning all to death whoreturn . That is what he meant when he said your life was not your own . 
But there are no such decrees yet ? 
What do I know ! said the postmaster , shrugging his shoulders ; there may be , or there will be . It is all the same . What would you have ? 
They rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night , and thenrode forward again when all the town was asleep . Among the many wild changesobservable on familiar things which made this wild ride unreal , not the leastwas the seeming rarity of sleep . After long and lonely spurring over drearyroads , they would come to a cluster of poor cottages , not steeped in darkness , but all glittering with lights , and would find the people , in a ghostly mannerin the dead of the night , circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree ofLiberty , or all drawn up together singing a Liberty song . Happily , however , there was sleep in Beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed ononce more into solitude and loneliness : jingling through the untimely cold andwet , among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth thatyear , diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses , and by the suddenemergence from ambuscade , and sharp reining up across their way , of patriotpatrols on the watch on all the roads . 
Daylight at last found them before the wall of Paris . The barrier was closedand strongly guarded when they rode up to it . 
Where are the papers of this prisoner ? demanded a resolute-looking man inauthority , who was summoned out by the guard . 
Naturally struck by the disagreeable word , Charles Darnay requested thespeaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and French citizen , incharge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had imposed uponhim , and which he had paid for . 
Where , repeated the same personage , without taking any heed of him whatever , are the papers of this prisoner ? 
The drunken patriot had them in his cap , and produced them . Casting his eyesover Gabelle's letter , the same personage in authority showed some disorder andsurprise , and looked at Darnay with a close attention . 
He left escort and escorted without saying a word , however , and went into theguard-room ; meanwhile , they sat upon their horses outside the gate . Lookingabout him while in this state of suspense , Charles Darnay observed that the gatewas held by a mixed guard of soldiers and patriots , the latter far outnumberingthe former ; and that while ingress into the city for peasants' carts bringing insupplies , and for similar traffic and traffickers , was easy enough , egress , evenfor the homeliest people , was very difficult . A numerous medley of men andwomen , not to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts , was waiting to issueforth ; but , the previous identification was so strict , that they filteredthrough the barrier very slowly . Some of these people knew their turn forexamination to be so far off , that they lay down on the ground to sleep orsmoke , while others talked together , or loitered about . The red cap andtri-colour cockade were universal , both among men and women . 
When he had sat in his saddle some half-hour , taking note of these things , Darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority , who directed theguard to open the barrier . Then he delivered to the escort , drunk and sober , areceipt for the escorted , and requested him to dismount . He did so , and the twopatriots , leading his tired horse , turned and rode away without entering thecity . 
He accompanied his conductor into a guard-room , smelling of common wine andtobacco , where certain soldiers and patriots , asleep and awake , drunk and sober , and in various neutral states between sleeping and waking , drunkenness andsobriety , were standing and lying about . The light in the guard-house , halfderived from the waning oil-lamps of the night , and half from the overcast day , was in a correspondingly uncertain condition . Some registers were lying open ona desk , and an officer of a coarse , dark aspect , presided over these . 
Citizen Defarge , said he to Darnay's conductor , as he took a slip of paperto write on . Is this the emigrant Evremonde ? 
This is the man . 
Your age , Evremonde ? 
Thirty-seven . 
Married , Evremonde ? 
Yes . 
Where married ? 
In England . 
Without doubt . Where is your wife , Evremonde ? 
In England . 
Without doubt . You are consigned , Evremonde , to the prison of LaForce . 
Just Heaven ! exclaimed Darnay . Under what law , and for whatoffence ? 
The officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment . 
We have new laws , Evremonde , and new offences , since you were here . He saidit with a hard smile , and went on writing . 
I entreat you to observe that I have come here voluntarily , in response tothat written appeal of a fellow-countryman which lies before you . I demand nomore than the opportunity to do so without delay . Is not that my right ? 
Emigrants have no rights , Evremonde , was the stolid reply . The officer wroteuntil he had finished , read over to himself what he had written , sanded it , andhanded it to Defarge , with the words In secret . 
Defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany him . The prisoner obeyed , and a guard of two armed patriots attended them . 
Is it you , said Defarge , in a low voice , as they went down the guardhousesteps and turned into Paris , who married the daughter of Doctor Manette , once aprisoner in the Bastille that is no more ? 
Yes , replied Darnay , looking at him with surprise . 
My name is Defarge , and I keep a wine-shop in the Quarter Saint Antoine . Possibly you have heard of me . 
My wife came to your house to reclaim her father ? Yes ! 
The word wife seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to Defarge , to say withsudden impatience , In the name of that sharp female newly-born , and called LaGuillotine , why did you come to France ? 
You heard me say why , a minute ago . Do you not believe it is thetruth ? 
A bad truth for you , said Defarge , speaking with knitted brows , and lookingstraight before him . 
Indeed I am lost here . All here is so unprecedented , so changed , so suddenand unfair , that I am absolutely lost . Will you render me a little help ? 
None . Defarge spoke , always looking straight before him . 
Will you answer me a single question ? 
Perhaps . According to its nature . You can say what it is . 
In this prison that I am going to so unjustly , shall I have some freecommunication with the world outside ? 
You will see . 
I am not to be buried there , prejudged , and without any means of presentingmy case ? 
You will see . But , what then ? Other people have been similarly buried inworse prisons , before now . 
But never by me , Citizen Defarge . 
Defarge glanced darkly at him for answer , and walked on in a steady and setsilence . The deeper he sank into this silence , the fainter hope there wasor soDarnay thoughtof his softening in any slight degree . He , therefore , made hasteto say : 
It is of the utmost importance to me (you know , Citizen , even better than I , of how much importance) , that I should be able to communicate to Mr . Lorry ofTellson's Bank , an English gentleman who is now in Paris , the simple fact , without comment , that I have been thrown into the prison of La Force . Will youcause that to be done for me ? 
I will do , Defarge doggedly rejoined , nothing for you . My duty is to mycountry and the People . I am the sworn servant of both , against you . I will donothing for you . 
Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further , and his pride wastouched besides . As they walked on in silence , he could not but see how used thepeople were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the streets . The verychildren scarcely noticed him . A few passers turned their heads , and a few shooktheir fingers at him as an aristocrat ; otherwise , that a man in good clothesshould be going to prison , was no more remarkable than that a labourer inworking clothes should be going to work . In one narrow , dark , and dirty streetthrough which they passed , an excited orator , mounted on a stool , was addressingan excited audience on the crimes against the people , of the king and the royalfamily . The few words that he caught from this man's lips , first made it knownto Charles Darnay that the king was in prison , and that the foreign ambassadorshad one and all left Paris . On the road (except at Beauvais) he had heardabsolutely nothing . The escort and the universal watchfulness had completelyisolated him . 
That he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had developedthemselves when he left England , he of course knew now . That perils hadthickened about him fast , and might thicken faster and faster yet , he of courseknew now . He could not but admit to himself that he might not have made thisjourney , if he could have foreseen the events of a few days . And yet hismisgivings were not so dark as , imagined by the light of this later time , theywould appear . Troubled as the future was , it was the unknown future , and in itsobscurity there was ignorant hope . The horrible massacre , days and nights long , which , within a few rounds of the clock , was to set a great mark of blood uponthe blessed garnering time of harvest , was as far out of his knowledge as if ithad been a hundred thousand years away . The sharp female newly-born , and calledLa Guillotine , was hardly known to him , or to the generality of people , byname . The frightful deeds that were to be soon done , were probably unimagined atthat time in the brains of the doers . How could they have a place in the shadowyconceptions of a gentle mind ? 
Of unjust treatment in detention and hardship , and in cruel separation fromhis wife and child , he foreshadowed the likelihood , or the certainty ; but , beyond this , he dreaded nothing distinctly . With this on his mind , which wasenough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard , he arrived at the prison of LaForce . 
A man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket , to whom Defarge presentedThe Emigrant Evremonde . 
What the Devil ! How many more of them ! exclaimed the man with the bloatedface . 
Defarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation , and withdrew , withhis two fellow-patriots . 
What the Devil , I say again ! exclaimed the gaoler , left with his wife . Howmany more ! 
The gaoler's wife , being provided with no answer to the question , merelyreplied , One must have patience , my dear ! Three turnkeys who enteredresponsive to a bell she rang , echoed the sentiment , and one added , For thelove of Liberty ; which sounded in that place like an inappropriate conclusion . 
The prison of La Force was a gloomy prison , dark and filthy , and with ahorrible smell of foul sleep in it . Extraordinary how soon the noisome flavourof imprisoned sleep , becomes manifest in all such places that are ill caredfor ! 
In secret , too , grumbled the gaoler , looking at the written paper . As if Iwas not already full to bursting ! 
He stuck the paper on a file , in an ill-humour , and Charles Darnay awaited hisfurther pleasure for half an hour : sometimes , pacing to and fro in the strongarched room : sometimes , resting on a stone seat : in either case detained to beimprinted on the memory of the chief and his subordinates . 
Come ! said the chief , at length taking up his keys , come with me , emigrant . 
Through the dismal prison twilight , his new charge accompanied him by corridorand staircase , many doors clanging and locking behind them , until they came intoa large , low , vaulted chamber , crowded with prisoners of both sexes . The womenwere seated at a long table , reading and writing , knitting , sewing , andembroidering ; the men were for the most part standing behind their chairs orlingering up and down the room . 
In the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and disgrace , the new-comer recoiled from this company . But the crowning unreality of his longunreal ride , was , their all at once rising to receive him , with every refinementof manner known to the time , and with all the engaging graces and courtesies oflife . 
So strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and gloom , so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and misery throughwhich they were seen , that Charles Darnay seemed to stand in a company of thedead . Ghosts all ! The ghost of beauty , the ghost of stateliness , the ghost ofelegance , the ghost of pride , the ghost of frivolity , the ghost of wit , theghost of youth , the ghost of age , all waiting their dismissal from the desolateshore , all turning on him eyes that were changed by the death they had died incoming there . 
It struck him motionless . The gaoler standing at his side , and the othergaolers moving about , who would have been well enough as to appearance in theordinary exercise of their functions , looked so extravagantly coarse contrastedwith sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were therewith theapparitions of the coquette , the young beauty , and the mature woman delicatelybredthat the inversion of all experience and likelihood which the scene ofshadows presented , was heightened to its utmost . Surely , ghosts all . Surely , thelong unreal ride some progress of disease that had brought him to these gloomyshades ! 
In the name of the assembled companions in misfortune , said a gentleman ofcourtly appearance and address , coming forward , I have the honour of giving youwelcome to La Force , and of condoling with you on the calamity that has broughtyou among us . May it soon terminate happily ! It would be an impertinenceelsewhere , but it is not so here , to ask your name and condition ? 
Charles Darnay roused himself , and gave the required information , in words assuitable as he could find . 
But I hope , said the gentleman , following the chief gaoler with his eyes , who moved across the room , that you are not in secret ? 
I do not understand the meaning of the term , but I have heard them sayso . 
Ah , what a pity ! We so much regret it ! But take courage ; several members ofour society have been in secret , at first , and it has lasted but a short time . Then he added , raising his voice , I grieve to inform the societyinsecret . 
There was a murmur of commiseration as Charles Darnay crossed the room to agrated door where the gaoler awaited him , and many voicesamong which , the softand compassionate voices of women were conspicuousgave him good wishes andencouragement . He turned at the grated door , to render the thanks of his heart ; it closed under the gaoler's hand ; and the apparitions vanished from his sightforever . 
The wicket opened on a stone staircase , leading upward . When they had ascendedforty steps (the prisoner of half an hour already counted them) , the gaoleropened a low black door , and they passed into a solitary cell . It struck coldand damp , but was not dark . 
Yours , said the gaoler . 
Why am I confined alone ? 
How do I know ! 
I can buy pen , ink , and paper ? 
Such are not my orders . You will be visited , and can ask then . At present , you may buy your food , and nothing more . 
There were in the cell , a chair , a table , and a straw mattress . As the gaolermade a general inspection of these objects , and of the four walls , before goingout , a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of the prisoner leaning againstthe wall opposite to him , that this gaoler was so unwholesomely bloated , both inface and person , as to look like a man who had been drowned and filled withwater . When the gaoler was gone , he thought in the same wandering way , Now am Ileft , as if I were dead . Stopping then , to look down at the mattress , he turnedfrom it with a sick feeling , and thought , And here in these crawling creaturesis the first condition of the body after death . 
Five paces by four and a half , five paces by four and a half , five paces byfour and a half . The prisoner walked to and fro in his cell , counting itsmeasurement , and the roar of the city arose like muffled drums with a wild swellof voices added to them . He made shoes , he made shoes , he made shoes . Theprisoner counted the measurement again , and paced faster , to draw his mind withhim from that latter repetition . The ghosts that vanished when the wicketclosed . There was one among them , the appearance of a lady dressed in black , whowas leaning in the embrasure of a window , and she had a light shining upon hergolden hair , and she looked like * * * * Let us ride on again , for God's sake , through the illuminated villages with the people all awake ! * * * * He madeshoes , he made shoes , he made shoes . * * * * Five paces by four and a half . With such scraps tossing and rolling upward from the depths of his mind , theprisoner walked faster and faster , obstinately counting and counting ; and theroar of the city changed to this extentthat it still rolled in like muffleddrums , but with the wail of voices that he knew , in the swell that rose abovethem . Book Three : The Track of the Storm
Tellson's Bank , established in the Saint Germain Quarter of Paris , was in awing of a large house , approached by a courtyard and shut off from the street bya high wall and a strong gate . The house belonged to a great nobleman who hadlived in it until he made a flight from the troubles , in his own cook's dress , and got across the borders . A mere beast of the chase flying from hunters , hewas still in his metempsychosis no other than the same Monseigneur , thepreparation of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong menbesides the cook in question . 
Monseigneur gone , and the three strong men absolving themselves from the sinof having drawn his high wages , by being more than ready and willing to cut histhroat on the altar of the dawning Republic one and indivisible of Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death , Monseigneur's house had been first sequestrated , and then confiscated . For , all things moved so fast , and decree followed decreewith that fierce precipitation , that now upon the third night of the autumnmonth of September , patriot emissaries of the law were in possession ofMonseigneur's house , and had marked it with the tri-colour , and were drinkingbrandy in its state apartments . 
A place of business in London like Tellson's place of business in Paris , wouldsoon have driven the House out of its mind and into the Gazette . For , what wouldstaid British responsibility and respectability have said to orange-trees inboxes in a Bank courtyard , and even to a Cupid over the counter ? Yet such thingswere . Tellson's had whitewashed the Cupid , but he was still to be seen on theceiling , in the coolest linen , aiming (as he very often does) at money frommorning to night . Bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young Pagan , inLombard-street , London , and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of theimmortal boy , and also of a looking-glass let into the wall , and also of clerksnot at all old , who danced in public on the slightest provocation . Yet , a FrenchTellson's could get on with these things exceedingly well , and , as long as thetimes held together , no man had taken fright at them , and drawn out hismoney . 
What money would be drawn out of Tellson's henceforth , and what would liethere , lost and forgotten ; what plate and jewels would tarnish in Tellson'shiding-places , while the depositors rusted in prisons , and when they should haveviolently perished ; how many accounts with Tellson's never to be balanced inthis world , must be carried over into the next ; no man could have said , thatnight , any more than Mr . Jarvis Lorry could , though he thought heavily of thesequestions . He sat by a newly-lighted wood fire (the blighted and unfruitful yearwas prematurely cold) , and on his honest and courageous face there was a deepershade than the pendent lamp could throw , or any object in the room distortedlyreflecta shade of horror . 
He occupied rooms in the Bank , in his fidelity to the House of which he hadgrown to be a part , like strong root-ivy . It chanced that they derived a kind ofsecurity from the patriotic occupation of the main building , but thetrue-hearted old gentleman never calculated about that . All such circumstanceswere indifferent to him , so that he did his duty . On the opposite side of thecourtyard , under a colonnade , was extensive standingfor carriageswhere , indeed , some carriages of Monseigneur yet stood . Against two of the pillars werefastened two great flaring flambeaux , and in the light of these , standing out inthe open air , was a large grindstone : a roughly mounted thing which appeared tohave hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy , or otherworkshop . Rising and looking out of window at these harmless objects , Mr . Lorryshivered , and retired to his seat by the fire . He had opened , not only the glasswindow , but the lattice blind outside it , and he had closed both again , and heshivered through his frame . 
From the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate , there came theusual night hum of the city , with now and then an indescribable ring in it , weird and unearthly , as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible nature were goingup to Heaven . 
Thank God , said Mr . Lorry , clasping his hands , that no one near and dear tome is in this dreadful town to-night . May He have mercy on all who are indanger ! 
Soon afterwards , the bell at the great gate sounded , and he thought , Theyhave come back ! and sat listening . But , there was no loud irruption into thecourtyard , as he had expected , and he heard the gate clash again , and all wasquiet . 
The nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague uneasinessrespecting the Bank , which a great change would naturally awaken , with suchfeelings roused . It was well guarded , and he got up to go among the trustypeople who were watching it , when his door suddenly opened , and two figuresrushed in , at sight of which he fell back in amazement . 
Lucie and her father ! Lucie with her arms stretched out to him , and with thatold look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified , that it seemed asthough it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give force and power to itin this one passage of her life . 
What is this ? cried Mr . Lorry , breathless and confused . What is the matter ? Lucie ! Manette ! What has happened ? What has brought you here ? What isit ? 
With the look fixed upon him , in her paleness and wildness , she panted out inhis arms , imploringly , O my dear friend ! My husband ! 
Your husband , Lucie ? 
Charles . 
What of Charles ? 
Here . 
Here , in Paris ? 
Has been here some daysthree or fourI don't know how manyI can't collectmy thoughts . An errand of generosity brought him here unknown to us ; he wasstopped at the barrier , and sent to prison . 
The old man uttered an irrepressible cry . Almost at the same moment , the begof the great gate rang again , and a loud noise of feet and voices came pouringinto the courtyard . 
What is that noise ? said the Doctor , turning towards the window . 
Don't look ! cried Mr . Lorry . Don't look out ! Manette , for your life , don'ttouch the blind ! 
The Doctor turned , with his hand upon the fastening of the window , and said , with a cool , bold smile : 
My dear friend , I have a charmed life in this city . I have been a Bastilleprisoner . There is no patriot in Parisin Paris ? In Francewho , knowing me tohave been a prisoner in the Bastille , would touch me , except to overwhelm mewith embraces , or carry me in triumph . My old pain has given me a power that hasbrought us through the barrier , and gained us news of Charles there , and broughtus here . I knew it would be so ; I knew I could help Charles out of all danger ; Itold Lucie so . What is that noise ? His hand was again upon the window . 
Don't look ! cried Mr . Lorry , absolutely desperate . No , Lucie , my dear , noryou ! He got his arm round her , and held her . Don't be so terrified , my love . Isolemnly swear to you that I know of no harm having happened to Charles ; that Ihad no suspicion even of his being in this fatal place . What prison is hein ? 
La Force ! 
La Force ! Lucie , my child , if ever you were brave and serviceable in yourlifeand you were always bothyou will compose yourself now , to do exactly as Ibid you ; for more depends upon it than you can think , or I can say . There is nohelp for you in any action on your part to-night ; you cannot possibly stir out . I say this , because what I must bid you to do for Charles's sake , is the hardestthing to do of all . You must instantly be obedient , still , and quiet . You mustlet me put you in a room at the back here . You must leave your father and mealone for two minutes , and as there are Life and Death in the world you must notdelay . 
I will be submissive to you . I see in your face that you know I can donothing else than this . I know you are true . 
The old man kissed her , and hurried her into his room , and turned the key ; then , came hurrying back to the Doctor , and opened the window and partly openedthe blind , and put his hand upon the Doctor's arm , and looked out with him intothe courtyard . 
Looked out upon a throng of men and women : not enough in number , or nearenough , to fill the courtyard : not more than forty or fifty in all . The peoplein possession of the house had let them in at the gate , and they had rushed into work at the grindstone ; it had evidently been set up there for their purpose , as in a convenient and retired spot . 
But , such awful workers , and such awful work ! 
The grindstone had a double handle , and , turning at it madly were two men , whose faces , as their long hair flapped back when the whirlings of thegrindstone brought their faces up , were more horrible and cruel than the visagesof the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise . False eyebrows andfalse moustaches were stuck upon them , and their hideous countenances were allbloody and sweaty , and all awry with howling , and all staring and glaring withbeastly excitement and want of sleep . As these ruffians turned and turned , theirmatted locks now flung forward over their eyes , now flung backward over theirnecks , some women held wine to their mouths that they might drink ; and what withdropping blood , and what with dropping wine , and what with the stream of sparksstruck out of the stone , all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and fire . Theeye could not detect one creature in the group free from the smear of blood . Shouldering one another to get next at the sharpening-stone , were men strippedto the waist , with the stain all over their limbs and bodies ; men in all sortsof rags , with the stain upon those rags ; men devilishly set off with spoils ofwomen's lace and silk and ribbon , with the stain dyeing those trifles throughand through . Hatchets , knives , bayonets , swords , all brought to be sharpened , were all red with it . Some of the hacked swords were tied to the wrists of thosewho carried them , with strips of linen and fragments of dress : ligatures variousin kind , but all deep of the one colour . And as the frantic wielders of theseweapons snatched them from the stream of sparks and tore away into the streets , the same red hue was red in their frenzied eyes ; eyes which any unbrutalisedbeholder would have given twenty years of life , to petrify with a well-directedgun . 
All this was seen in a moment , as the vision of a drowning man , or of anyhuman creature at any very great pass , could see a world if it were there . Theydrew back from the window , and the Doctor looked for explanation in his friend'sashy face . 
They are , Mr . Lorry whispered the words , glancing fearfully round at thelocked room , murdering the prisoners . If you are sure of what you say ; if youreally have the power you think you haveas I believe you havemake yourselfknown to these devils , and get taken to La Force . It may be too late , I don'tknow , but let it not be a minute later ! 
Doctor Manette pressed his hand , hastened bareheaded out of the room , and wasin the courtyard when Mr . Lorry regained the blind . 
His streaming white hair , his remarkable face , and the impetuous confidence ofhis manner , as he put the weapons aside like water , carried him in an instant tothe heart of the concourse at the stone . For a few moments there was a pause , and a hurry , and a murmur , and the unintelligible sound of his voice ; and thenMr . Lorry saw him , surrounded by all , and in the midst of a line of twenty menlong , all linked shoulder to shoulder , and hand to shoulder , hurried out withcries ofLive the Bastille prisoner ! Help for the Bastille prisoner's kindredin La Force ! Room for the Bastille prisoner in front there ! Save the prisonerEvremonde at La Force ! and a thousand answering shouts . 
He closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart , closed the window and thecurtain , hastened to Lucie , and told her that her father was assisted by thepeople , and gone in search of her husband . He found her child and Miss Prosswith her ; but , it never occurred to him to be surprised by their appearanceuntil a long time afterwards , when he sat watching them in such quiet as thenight knew . 
Lucie had , by that time , fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet , clinging to his hand . Miss Pross had laid the child down on his own bed , and herhead had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty charge . O the long , long night , with the moans of the poor wife ! And O the long , long night , with noreturn of her father and no tidings ! 
Twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded , and theirruption was repeated , and the grindstone whirled and spluttered . What is it ? cried Lucie , affrighted . Hush ! The soldiers' swords are sharpened there , saidMr . Lorry . The place is national property now , and used as a kind of armoury , my love . 
Twice more in all ; but , the last spell of work was feeble and fitful . Soonafterwards the day began to dawn , and he softly detached himself from theclasping hand , and cautiously looked out again . A man , so besmeared that hemight have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping back to consciousness on afield of slain , was rising from the pavement by the side of the grindstone , andlooking about him with a vacant air . Shortly , this worn-out murderer descried inthe imperfect light one of the carriages of Monseigneur , and , staggering to thatgorgeous vehicle , climbed in at the door , and shut himself up to take his reston its dainty cushions . 
The great grindstone , Earth , had turned when Mr . Lorry looked out again , andthe sun was red on the courtyard . But , the lesser grindstone stood alone therein the calm morning air , with a red upon it that the sun had never given , andwould never take away . 
One of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of Mr . Lorrywhen business hours came round , was this : that he had no right to imperilTellson's by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under the Bank roof . His own possessions , safety , life , he would have hazarded for Lucie and herchild , without a moment's demur ; but the great trust he held was not his own , and as to that business charge he was a strict man of business . 
At first , his mind reverted to Defarge , and he thought of finding out thewine-shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to the safestdwelling-place in the distracted state of the city . But , the same considerationthat suggested him , repudiated him ; he lived in the most violent Quarter , anddoubtless was influential there , and deep in its dangerous workings . 
Noon coming , and the Doctor not returning , and every minute's delay tending tocompromise Tellson's , Mr . Lorry advised with Lucie . She said that her father hadspoken of hiring a lodging for a short term , in that Quarter , near theBanking-house . As there was no business objection to this , and as he foresawthat even if it were all well with Charles , and he were to be released , he couldnot hope to leave the city , Mr . Lorry went out in quest of such a lodging , andfound a suitable one , high up in a removed by-street where the closed blinds inall the other windows of a high melancholy square of buildings marked desertedhomes . 
To this lodging he at once removed Lucie and her child , and Miss Pross : givingthem what comfort he could , and much more than he had himself . He left Jerrywith them , as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear considerable knockingon the head , and retained to his own occupations . A disturbed and doleful mindhe brought to bear upon them , and slowly and heavily the day lagged on withhim . 
It wore itself out , and wore him out with it , until the Bank closed . He wasagain alone in his room of the previous night , considering what to do next , whenhe heard a foot upon the stair . In a few moments , a man stood in his presence , who , with a keenly observant look at him , addressed him by his name . 
Your servant , said Mr . Lorry . Do you know me ? 
He was a strongly made man with dark curling hair , from forty-five to fiftyyears of age . For answer he repeated , without any change of emphasis , thewords : 
Do you know me ? 
I have seen you somewhere . 
Perhaps at my wine-shop ? 
Much interested and agitated , Mr . Lorry said : You come from DoctorManette ? 
Yes . I come from Doctor Manette . 
And what says he ? What does he send me ? 
Defarge gave into his anxious hand , an open scrap of paper . It bore the wordsin the Doctor's writing : 
Charles is safe , but I cannot safely leave this place yet . I have obtainedthe favour that the bearer has a short note from Charles to his wife . Let thebearer see his wife . 
It was dated from La Force , within an hour . 
Will you accompany me , said Mr . Lorry , joyfully relieved after reading thisnote aloud , to where his wife resides ? 
Yes , returned Defarge . 
Scarcely noticing as yet , in what a curiously reserved and mechanical wayDefarge spoke , Mr . Lorry put on his hat and they went down into the courtyard . There , they found two women ; one , knitting . 
Madame Defarge , surely ! said Mr . Lorry , who had left her in exactly the sameattitude some seventeen years ago . 
It is she , observed her husband . 
Does Madame go with us ? inquired Mr . Lorry , seeing that she moved as theymoved . 
Yes . That she may be able to recognise the faces and know the persons . It isfor their safety . 
Beginning to be struck by Defarge's manner , Mr . Lorry looked dubiously at him , and led the way . Both the women followed ; the second woman being TheVengeance . 
They passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might , ascendedthe staircase of the new domicile , were admitted by Jerry , and found Lucieweeping , alone . She was thrown into a transport by the tidings Mr . Lorry gaveher of her husband , and clasped the hand that delivered his notelittle thinkingwhat it had been doing near him in the night , and might , but for a chance , havedone to him . 
DEAREST , Take courage . I am well , and your father has influence around me . You cannot answer this . Kiss our child for me . 
That was all the writing . It was so much , however , to her who received it , that she turned from Defarge to his wife , and kissed one of the hands thatknitted . It was a passionate , loving , thankful , womanly action , but the handmade no responsedropped cold and heavy , and took to its knitting again . 
There was something in its touch that gave Lucie a check . She stopped in theact of putting the note in her bosom , and , with her hands yet at her neck , looked terrified at Madame Defarge . Madame Defarge met the lifted eyebrows andforehead with a cold , impassive stare . 
My dear , said Mr . Lorry , striking in to explain ; there are frequent risingsin the streets ; and , although it is not likely they will ever trouble you , Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power to protect at suchtimes , to the end that she may know themthat she may identify them . I believe , said Mr . Lorry , rather halting in his reassuring words , as the stony manner ofall the three impressed itself upon him more and more , I state the case , Citizen Defarge ? 
Defarge looked gloomily at his wife , and gave no other answer than a gruffsound of acquiescence . 
You had better , Lucie , said Mr . Lorry , doing all he could to propitiate , bytone and manner , have the dear child here , and our good Pross . Our good Pross , Defarge , is an English lady , and knows no French . 
The lady in question , whose rooted conviction that she was more than a matchfor any foreigner , was not to be shaken by distress and , danger , appeared withfolded arms , and observed in English to The Vengeance , whom her eyes firstencountered , Well , I am sure , Boldface ! I hope YOU are pretty well ! She alsobestowed a British cough on Madame Defarge ; but , neither of the two took muchheed of her . 
Is that his child ? said Madame Defarge , stopping in her work for the firsttime , and pointing her knitting-needle at little Lucie as if it were the fingerof Fate . 
Yes , madame , answered Mr . Lorry ; this is our poor prisoner's darlingdaughter , and only child . 
The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed to fall sothreatening and dark on the child , that her mother instinctively kneeled on theground beside her , and held her to her breast . The shadow attendant on MadameDefarge and her party seemed then to fall , threatening and dark , on both themother and the child . 
It is enough , my husband , said Madame Defarge . I have seen them . We maygo . 
But , the suppressed manner had enough of menace in itnot visible andpresented , but indistinct and withheldto alarm Lucie into saying , as she laidher appealing hand on Madame Defarge's dress : 
You will be good to my poor husband . You will do him no harm . You will helpme to see him if you can ? 
Your husband is not my business here , returned Madame Defarge , looking downat her with perfect composure . It is the daughter of your father who is mybusiness here . 
For my sake , then , be merciful to my husband . For my child's sake ! She willput her hands together and pray you to be merciful . We are more afraid of youthan of these others . 
Madame Defarge received it as a compliment , and looked at her husband . Defarge , who had been uneasily biting his thumb-nail and looking at her , collected his face into a sterner expression . 
What is it that your husband says in that little letter ? asked MadameDefarge , with a lowering smile . Influence ; he says something touchinginfluence ? 
That my father , said Lucie , hurriedly taking the paper from her breast , butwith her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it , has much influencearound him . 
Surely it will release him ! said Madame Defarge . Let it do so . 
As a wife and mother , cried Lucie , most earnestly , I implore you to havepity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess , against my innocenthusband , but to use it in his behalf . O sister-woman , think of me . As a wife andmother ! 
Madame Defarge looked , coldly as ever , at the suppliant , and said , turning toher friend The Vengeance : 
The wives and mothers we have been used to see , since we were as little asthis child , and much less , have not been greatly considered ? We have known THEIRhusbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them , often enough ? All ourlives , we have seen our sister-women suffer , in themselves and in theirchildren , poverty , nakedness , hunger , thirst , sickness , misery , oppression andneglect of all kinds ? 
We have seen nothing else , returned The Vengeance . 
We have borne this a long time , said Madame Defarge , turning her eyes againupon Lucie . Judge you ! Is it likely that the trouble of one wife and motherwould be much to us now ? 
She resumed her knitting and went out . The Vengeance followed . Defarge wentlast , and closed the door . 
Courage , my dear Lucie , said Mr . Lorry , as he raised her . Courage , courage ! So far all goes well with usmuch , much better than it has of late gone withmany poor souls . Cheer up , and have a thankful heart . 
I am not thankless , I hope , but that dreadful woman seems to throw a shadowon me and on all my hopes . 
Tut , tut ! said Mr . Lorry ; what is this despondency in the brave littlebreast ? A shadow indeed ! No substance in it , Lucie . 
But the shadow of the manner of these Defarges was dark upon himself , for allthat , and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly . 
Doctor Manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of hisabsence . So much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be keptfrom the knowledge of Lucie was so well concealed from her , that not until longafterwards , when France and she were far apart , did she know that eleven hundreddefenceless prisoners of both sexes and all ages had been killed by thepopulace ; that four days and nights had been darkened by this deed of horror ; and that the air around her had been tainted by the slain . She only knew thatthere had been an attack upon the prisons , that all political prisoners had beenin danger , and that some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered . 
To Mr . Lorry , the Doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on whichhe had no need to dwell , that the crowd had taken him through a scene of carnageto the prison of La Force . That , in the prison he had found a self-appointedTribunal sitting , before which the prisoners were brought singly , and by whichthey were rapidly ordered to be put forth to be massacred , or to be released , or(in a few cases) to be sent back to their cells . That , presented by hisconductors to this Tribunal , he had announced himself by name and profession ashaving been for eighteen years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the Bastille ; that , one of the body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him , andthat this man was Defarge . 
That , hereupon he had ascertained , through the registers on the table , thathis son-in-law was among the living prisoners , and had pleaded hard to theTribunalof whom some members were asleep and some awake , some dirty with murderand some clean , some sober and some notfor his life and liberty . That , in thefirst frantic greetings lavished on himself as a notable sufferer under theoverthrown system , it had been accorded to him to have Charles Darnay broughtbefore the lawless Court , and examined . That , he seemed on the point of being atonce released , when the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check (notintelligible to the Doctor) , which led to a few words of secret conference . That , the man sitting as President had then informed Doctor Manette that theprisoner must remain in custody , but should , for his sake , be held inviolate insafe custody . That , immediately , on a signal , the prisoner was removed to theinterior of the prison again ; but , that he , the Doctor , had then so stronglypleaded for permission to remain and assure himself that his son-in-law was , through no malice or mischance , delivered to the concourse whose murderous yellsoutside the gate had often drowned the proceedings , that he had obtained thepermission , and had remained in that Hall of Blood until the danger wasover . 
The sights he had seen there , with brief snatches of food and sleep byintervals , shall remain untold . The mad joy over the prisoners who were saved , had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against those who were cutto pieces . One prisoner there was , he said , who had been discharged into thestreet free , but at whom a mistaken savage had thrust a pike as he passed out . Being besought to go to him and dress the wound , the Doctor had passed out atthe same gate , and had found him in the arms of a company of Samaritans , whowere seated on the bodies of their victims . With an inconsistency as monstrousas anything in this awful nightmare , they had helped the healer , and tended thewounded man with the gentlest solicitudehad made a litter for him and escortedhim carefully from the spothad then caught up their weapons and plunged anewinto a butchery so dreadful , that the Doctor had covered his eyes with hishands , and swooned away in the midst of it . 
As Mr . Lorry received these confidences , and as he watched the face of hisfriend now sixty-two years of age , a misgiving arose within him that such dreadexperiences would revive the old danger . 
But , he had never seen his friend in his present aspect : he had never at allknown him in his present character . For the first time the Doctor felt , now , that his suffering was strength and power . For the first time he felt that inthat sharp fire , he had slowly forged the iron which could break the prison doorof his daughter's husband , and deliver him . It all tended to a good end , myfriend ; it was not mere waste and ruin . As my beloved child was helpful inrestoring me to myself , I will be helpful now in restoring the dearest part ofherself to her ; by the aid of Heaven I will do it ! Thus , Doctor Manette . Andwhen Jarvis Lorry saw the kindled eyes , the resolute face , the calm strong lookand bearing of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped , like a clock , for so many years , and then set going again with an energy whichhad lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness , he believed . 
Greater things than the Doctor had at that time to contend with , would haveyielded before his persevering purpose . While he kept himself in his place , as aphysician , whose business was with all degrees of mankind , bond and free , richand poor , bad and good , he used his personal influence so wisely , that he wassoon the inspecting physician of three prisons , and among them of La Force . Hecould now assure Lucie that her husband was no longer confined alone , but wasmixed with the general body of prisoners ; he saw her husband weekly , and broughtsweet messages to her , straight from his lips ; sometimes her husband himselfsent a letter to her (though never by the Doctor's hand) , but she was notpermitted to write to him : for , among the many wild suspicions of plots in theprisons , the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were known to have madefriends or permanent connections abroad . 
This new life of the Doctor's was an anxious life , no doubt ; still , thesagacious Mr . Lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it . Nothingunbecoming tinged the pride ; it was a natural and worthy one ; but he observed itas a curiosity . The Doctor knew , that up to that time , his imprisonment had beenassociated in the minds of his daughter and his friend , with his personalaffliction , deprivation , and weakness . Now that this was changed , and he knewhimself to be invested through that old trial with forces to which they bothlooked for Charles's ultimate safety and deliverance , he became so far exaltedby the change , that he took the lead and direction , and required them as theweak , to trust to him as the strong . The preceding relative positions of himselfand Lucie were reversed , yet only as the liveliest gratitude and affection couldreverse them , for he could have had no pride but in rendering some service toher who had rendered so much to him . All curious to see , thought Mr . Lorry , inhis amiably shrewd way , but all natural and right ; so , take the lead , my dearfriend , and keep it ; it couldn't be in better hands . 
But , though the Doctor tried hard , and never ceased trying , to get CharlesDarnay set at liberty , or at least to get him brought to trial , the publiccurrent of the time set too strong and fast for him . The new era began ; the kingwas tried , doomed , and beheaded ; the Republic of Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death , declared for victory or death against the world in arms ; the blackflag waved night and day from the great towers of Notre Dame ; three hundredthousand men , summoned to rise against the tyrants of the earth , rose from allthe varying soils of France , as if the dragon's teeth had been sown broadcast , and had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain , on rock , in gravel , andalluvial mud , under the bright sky of the South and under the clouds of theNorth , in fell and forest , in the vineyards and the olive-grounds and among thecropped grass and the stubble of the corn , along the fruitful banks of the broadrivers , and in the sand of the sea-shore . What private solicitude could rearitself against the deluge of the Year One of Libertythe deluge rising frombelow , not falling from above , and with the windows of Heaven shut , notopened ! 
There was no pause , no pity , no peace , no interval of relenting rest , nomeasurement of time . Though days and nights circled as regularly as when timewas young , and the evening and morning were the first day , other count of timethere was none . Hold of it was lost in the raging fever of a nation , as it is inthe fever of one patient . Now , breaking the unnatural silence of a whole city , the executioner showed the people the head of the kingand now , it seemed almostin the same breath , the head of his fair wife which had had eight weary monthsof imprisoned widowhood and misery , to turn it grey . 
And yet , observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in all suchcases , the time was long , while it flamed by so fast . A revolutionary tribunalin the capital , and forty or fifty thousand revolutionary committees all overthe land ; a law of the Suspected , which struck away all security for liberty orlife , and delivered over any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one ; prisons gorged with people who had committed no offence , and could obtain nohearing ; these things became the established order and nature of appointedthings , and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old . Aboveall , one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before the generalgaze from the foundations of the worldthe figure of the sharp female called LaGuillotine . 
It was the popular theme for jests ; it was the best cure for headache , itinfallibly prevented the hair from turning grey , it imparted a peculiar delicacyto the complexion , it was the National Razor which shaved close : who kissed LaGuillotine , looked through the little window and sneezed into the sack . It wasthe sign of the regeneration of the human race . It superseded the Cross . Modelsof it were worn on breasts from which the Cross was discarded , and it was boweddown to and believed in where the Cross was denied . 
It sheared off heads so many , that it , and the ground it most polluted , were arotten red . It was taken to pieces , like a toy-puzzle for a young Devil , and wasput together again when the occasion wanted it . It hushed the eloquent , struckdown the powerful , abolished the beautiful and good . Twenty-two friends of highpublic mark , twenty-one living and one dead , it had lopped the heads off , in onemorning , in as many minutes . The name of the strong man of Old Scripture haddescended to the chief functionary who worked it ; but , so armed , he was strongerthan his namesake , and blinder , and tore away the gates of God's own Templeevery day . 
Among these terrors , and the brood belonging to them , the Doctor walked with asteady head : confident in his power , cautiously persistent in his end , neverdoubting that he would save Lucie's husband at last . Yet the current of the timeswept by , so strong and deep , and carried the time away so fiercely , thatCharles had lain in prison one year and three months when the Doctor was thussteady and confident . So much more wicked and distracted had the Revolutiongrown in that December month , that the rivers of the South were encumbered withthe bodies of the violently drowned by night , and prisoners were shot in linesand squares under the southern wintry sun . Still , the Doctor walked among theterrors with a steady head . No man better known than he , in Paris at that day ; no man in a stranger situation . Silent , humane , indispensable in hospital andprison , using his art equally among assassins and victims , he was a man apart . In the exercise of his skill , the appearance and the story of the BastilleCaptive removed him from all other men . He was not suspected or brought inquestion , any more than if he had indeed been recalled to life some eighteenyears before , or were a Spirit moving among mortals . 
One year and three months . During all that time Lucie was never sure , fromhour to hour , but that the Guillotine would strike off her husband's head nextday . Every day , through the stony streets , the tumbrils now jolted heavily , filled with Condemned . Lovely girls ; bright women , brown-haired , black-haired , and grey ; youths ; stalwart men and old ; gentle born and peasant born ; all redwine for La Guillotine , all daily brought into light from the dark cellars ofthe loathsome prisons , and carried to her through the streets to slake herdevouring thirst . Liberty , equality , fraternity , or death ; the last , much theeasiest to bestow , O Guillotine ! 
If the suddenness of her calamity , and the whirling wheels of the time , hadstunned the Doctor's daughter into awaiting the result in idle despair , it wouldbut have been with her as it was with many . But , from the hour when she hadtaken the white head to her fresh young bosom in the garret of Saint Antoine , she had been true to her duties . She was truest to them in the season of trial , as all the quietly loyal and good will always be . 
As soon as they were established in their new residence , and her father hadentered on the routine of his avocations , she arranged the little household asexactly as if her husband had been there . Everything had its appointed place andits appointed time . Little Lucie she taught , as regularly , as if they had allbeen united in their English home . The slight devices with which she cheatedherself into the show of a belief that they would soon be reunitedthe littlepreparations for his speedy return , the setting aside of his chair and hisbooksthese , and the solemn prayer at night for one dear prisoner especially , among the many unhappy souls in prison and the shadow of death--were almost theonly outspoken reliefs of her heavy mind . 
She did not greatly alter in appearance . The plain dark dresses , akin tomourning dresses , which she and her child wore , were as neat and as wellattended to as the brighter clothes of happy days . She lost her colour , and theold and intent expression was a constant , not an occasional , thing ; otherwise , she remained very pretty and comely . Sometimes , at night on kissing her father , she would burst into the grief she had repressed all day , and would say that hersole reliance , under Heaven , was on him . He always resolutely answered : Nothingcan happen to him without my knowledge , and I know that I can save him , Lucie . 
They had not made the round of their changed life many weeks , when her fathersaid to her , on coming home one evening : 
My dear , there is an upper window in the prison , to which Charles cansometimes gain access at three in the afternoon . When he can get to itwhichdepends on many uncertainties and incidentshe might see you in the street , hethinks , if you stood in a certain place that I can show you . But you will not beable to see him , my poor child , and even if you could , it would be unsafe foryou to make a sign of recognition . 
O show me the place , my father , and I will go there every day . 
From that time , in all weathers , she waited there two hours . As the clockstruck two , she was there , and at four she turned resignedly away . When it wasnot too wet or inclement for her child to be with her , they went together ; atother times she was alone ; but , she never missed a single day . 
It was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street . The hovel of acutter of wood into lengths for burning , was the only house at that end ; allelse was wall . On the third day of her being there , he noticed her . 
Good day , citizeness . 
Good day , citizen . 
This mode of address was now prescribed by decree . It had been establishedvoluntarily some time ago , among the more thorough patriots ; but , was now lawfor everybody . 
Walking here again , citizeness ? 
You see me , citizen ! 
The wood-sawyer , who was a little man with a redundancy of gesture (he hadonce been a mender of roads) , cast a glance at the prison , pointed at theprison , and putting his ten fingers before his face to represent bars , peepedthrough them jocosely . 
But it's not my business , said he . And went on sawing his wood . 
Next day he was looking out for her , and accosted her the moment sheappeared . 
What ? Walking here again , citizeness ? 
Yes , citizen . 
Ah ! A child too ! Your mother , is it not , my little citizeness ? 
Do I say yes , mamma ? whispered little Lucie , drawing close to her . 
Yes , dearest . 
Yes , citizen . 
Ah ! But it's not my business . My work is my business . See my saw ! I call itmy Little Guillotine . La , la , la ; La , la , la ! And off his head comes ! 
The billet fell as he spoke , and he threw it into a basket . 
I call myself the Samson of the firewood guillotine . See here again ! Loo , loo , loo ; Loo , loo , loo ! And off HER head comes ! Now , a child . Tickle , tickle ; Pickle , pickle ! And off ITS head comes . All the family ! 
Lucie shuddered as he threw two more billets into his basket , but it wasimpossible to be there while the wood-sawyer was at work , and not be in hissight . Thenceforth , to secure his good will , she always spoke to him first , andoften gave him drink-money , which he readily received . 
He was an inquisitive fellow , and sometimes when she had quite forgotten himin gazing at the prison roof and grates , and in lifting her heart up to herhusband , she would come to herself to find him looking at her , with his knee onhis bench and his saw stopped in its work . But it's not my business ! he wouldgenerally say at those times , and would briskly fall to his sawing again . 
In all weathers , in the snow and frost of winter , in the bitter winds ofspring , in the hot sunshine of summer , in the rains of autumn , and again in thesnow and frost of winter , Lucie passed two hours of every day at this place ; andevery day on leaving it , she kissed the prison wall . Her husband saw her (so shelearned from her father) it might be once in five or six times : it might betwice or thrice running : it might be , not for a week or a fortnight together . Itwas enough that he could and did see her when the chances served , and on thatpossibility she would have waited out the day , seven days a week . 
These occupations brought her round to the December month , wherein her fatherwalked among the terrors with a steady head . On a lightly-snowing afternoon shearrived at the usual corner . It was a day of some wild rejoicing , and afestival . She had seen the houses , as she came along , decorated with littlepikes , and with little red caps stuck upon them ; also , with tricoloured ribbons ; also , with the standard inscription (tricoloured letters were the favourite) , Republic One and Indivisible . Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death ! 
The miserable shop of the wood-sawyer was so small , that its whole surfacefurnished very indifferent space for this legend . He had got somebody to scrawlit up for him , however , who had squeezed Death in with most inappropriatedifficulty . On his house-top , he displayed pike and cap , as a good citizen must , and in a window he had stationed his saw inscribed as his Little SainteGuillotine for the great sharp female was by that time popularly canonised . His shop was shut and he was not there , which was a relief to Lucie , and lefther quite alone . 
But , he was not far off , for presently she heard a troubled movement and ashouting coming along , which filled her with fear . A moment afterwards , and athrong of people came pouring round the corner by the prison wall , in the midstof whom was the wood-sawyer hand in hand with The Vengeance . There could not befewer than five hundred people , and they were dancing like five thousand demons . There was no other music than their own singing . They danced to the popularRevolution song , keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth inunison . Men and women danced together , women danced together , men dancedtogether , as hazard had brought them together . At first , they were a mere stormof coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags ; but , as they filled the place , andstopped to dance about Lucie , some ghastly apparition of a dance-figure goneraving mad arose among them . They advanced , retreated , struck at one another'shands , clutched at one another's heads , spun round alone , caught one another andspun round in pairs , until many of them dropped . While those were down , the restlinked hand in hand , and all spun round together : then the ring broke , and inseparate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they all stopped atonce , began again , struck , clutched , and tore , and then reversed the spin , andall spun round another way . Suddenly they stopped again , paused , struck out thetime afresh , formed into lines the width of the public way , and , with theirheads low down and their hands high up , swooped screaming off . No fight couldhave been half so terrible as this dance . It was so emphatically a fallensporta something , once innocent , delivered over to all devilrya healthypastime changed into a means of angering the blood , bewildering the senses , andsteeling the heart . Such grace as was visible in it , made it the uglier , showinghow warped and perverted all things good by nature were become . The maidenlybosom bared to this , the pretty almost-child's head thus distracted , thedelicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt , were types of thedisjointed time . 
This was the Carmagnole . As it passed , leaving Lucie frightened and bewilderedin the doorway of the wood-sawyer's house , the feathery snow fell as quietly andlay as white and soft , as if it had never been . 
O my father ! for he stood before her when she lifted up the eyes she hadmomentarily darkened with her hand ; such a cruel , bad sight . 
I know , my dear , I know . I have seen it many times . Don't be frightened ! Notone of them would harm you . 
I am not frightened for myself , my father . But when I think of my husband , and the mercies of these people
We will set him above their mercies very soon . I left him climbing to thewindow , and I came to tell you . There is no one here to see . You may kiss yourhand towards that highest shelving roof . 
I do so , father , and I send him my Soul with it ! 
You cannot see him , my poor dear ? 
No , father , said Lucie , yearning and weeping as she kissed her hand , no . 
A footstep in the snow . Madame Defarge . I salute you , citizeness , from theDoctor . I salute you , citizen . This in passing . Nothing more . Madame Defargegone , like a shadow over the white road . 
Give me your arm , my love . Pass from here with an air of cheerfulness andcourage , for his sake . That was well done ; they had left the spot ; it shallnot be in vain . Charles is summoned for to-morrow . 
For to-morrow ! 
There is no time to lose . I am well prepared , but there are precautions to betaken , that could not be taken until he was actually summoned before theTribunal . He has not received the notice yet , but I know that he will presentlybe summoned for to-morrow , and removed to the Conciergerie ; I have timelyinformation . You are not afraid ? 
She could scarcely answer , I trust in you . 
Do so , implicitly . Your suspense is nearly ended , my darling ; he shall berestored to you within a few hours ; I have encompassed him with everyprotection . I must see Lorry . 
He stopped . There was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing . They bothknew too well what it meant . One . Two . Three . Three tumbrils faring away withtheir dread loads over the hushing snow . 
I must see Lorry , the Doctor repeated , turning her another way . 
The staunch old gentleman was still in his trust ; had never left it . He andhis books were in frequent requisition as to property confiscated and madenational . What he could save for the owners , he saved . No better man living tohold fast by what Tellson's had in keeping , and to hold his peace . 
A murky red and yellow sky , and a rising mist from the Seine , denoted theapproach of darkness . It was almost dark when they arrived at the Bank . Thestately residence of Monseigneur was altogether blighted and deserted . Above aheap of dust and ashes in the court , ran the letters : National Property . Republic One and Indivisible . Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death ! 
Who could that be with Mr . Lorrythe owner of the riding-coat upon thechairwho must not be seen ? From whom newly arrived , did he come out , agitatedand surprised , to take his favourite in his arms ? To whom did he appear torepeat her faltering words , when , raising his voice and turning his head towardsthe door of the room from which he had issued , he said : Removed to theConciergerie , and summoned for to-morrow ? 
The dread tribunal of five Judges , Public Prosecutor , and determined Jury , satevery day . Their lists went forth every evening , and were read out by thegaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners . The standard gaoler-joke was , Come out and listen to the Evening Paper , you inside there ! 
Charles Evremonde , called Darnay ! 
So at last began the Evening Paper at La Force . 
When a name was called , its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved for thosewho were announced as being thus fatally recorded . Charles Evremonde , calledDarnay , had reason to know the usage ; he had seen hundreds pass away so . 
His bloated gaoler , who wore spectacles to read with , glanced over them toassure himself that he had taken his place , and went through the list , making asimilar short pause at each name . There were twenty-three names , but only twentywere responded to ; for one of the prisoners so summoned had died in gaol andbeen forgotten , and two had already been guillotined and forgotten . The list wasread , in the vaulted chamber where Darnay had seen the associated prisoners onthe night of his arrival . Every one of those had perished in the massacre ; everyhuman creature he had since cared for and parted with , had died on thescaffold . 
There were hurried words of farewell and kindness , but the parting was soonover . It was the incident of every day , and the society of La Force were engagedin the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little concert , for thatevening . They crowded to the grates and shed tears there ; but , twenty places inthe projected entertainments had to be refilled , and the time was , at best , short to the lock-up hour , when the common rooms and corridors would bedelivered over to the great dogs who kept watch there through the night . Theprisoners were far from insensible or unfeeling ; their ways arose out of thecondition of the time . Similarly , though with a subtle difference , a species offervour or intoxication , known , without doubt , to have led some persons to bravethe guillotine unnecessarily , and to die by it , was not mere boastfulness , but awild infection of the wildly shaken public mind . In seasons of pestilence , someof us will have a secret attraction to the diseasea terrible passinginclination to die of it . And all of us have like wonders hidden in our breasts , only needing circumstances to evoke them . 
The passage to the Conciergerie was short and dark ; the night in itsvermin-haunted cells was long and cold . Next day , fifteen prisoners were put tothe bar before Charles Darnay's name was called . All the fifteen were condemned , and the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half . 
Charles Evremonde , called Darnay , was at length arraigned . 
His judges sat upon the Bench in feathered hats ; but the rough red cap andtricoloured cockade was the head-dress otherwise prevailing . Looking at the Juryand the turbulent audience , he might have thought that the usual order of thingswas reversed , and that the felons were trying the honest men . The lowest , cruelest , and worst populace of a city , never without its quantity of low , cruel , and bad , were the directing spirits of the scene : noisily commenting , applauding , disapproving , anticipating , and precipitating the result , without acheck . Of the men , the greater part were armed in various ways ; of the women , some wore knives , some daggers , some ate and drank as they looked on , manyknitted . Among these last , was one , with a spare piece of knitting under her armas she worked . She was in a front row , by the side of a man whom he had neverseen since his arrival at the Barrier , but whom he directly remembered asDefarge . He noticed that she once or twice whispered in his ear , and that sheseemed to be his wife ; but , what he most noticed in the two figures was , thatalthough they were posted as close to himself as they could be , they neverlooked towards him . They seemed to be waiting for something with a doggeddetermination , and they looked at the Jury , but at nothing else . Under thePresident sat Doctor Manette , in his usual quiet dress . As well as the prisonercould see , he and Mr . Lorry were the only men there , unconnected with theTribunal , who wore their usual clothes , and had not assumed the coarse garb ofthe Carmagnole . 
Charles Evremonde , called Darnay , was accused by the public prosecutor as anemigrant , whose life was forfeit to the Republic , under the decree whichbanished all emigrants on pain of Death . It was nothing that the decree boredate since his return to France . There he was , and there was the decree ; he hadbeen taken in France , and his head was demanded . 
Take off his head ! cried the audience . An enemy to the Republic ! 
The President rang his bell to silence those cries , and asked the prisonerwhether it was not true that he had lived many years in England ? 
Undoubtedly it was . 
Was he not an emigrant then ? What did he call himself ? 
Not an emigrant , he hoped , within the sense and spirit of the law . 
Why not ? the President desired to know . 
Because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful to him , and a station that was distasteful to him , and had left his countryhe submittedbefore the word emigrant in the present acceptation by the Tribunal was inuseto live by his own industry in England , rather than on the industry of theoverladen people of France . 
What proof had he of this ? 
He handed in the names of two witnesses ; Theophile Gabelle , and AlexandreManette . 
But he had married in England ? the President reminded him . 
True , but not an English woman . 
A citizeness of France ? 
Yes . By birth . 
Her name and family ? 
Lucie Manette , only daughter of Doctor Manette , the good physician who sitsthere . 
This answer had a happy effect upon the audience . Cries in exaltation of thewell-known good physician rent the hall . So capriciously were the people moved , that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious countenances which had beenglaring at the prisoner a moment before , as if with impatience to pluck him outinto the streets and kill him . 
On these few steps of his dangerous way , Charles Darnay had set his footaccording to Doctor Manette's reiterated instructions . The same cautious counseldirected every step that lay before him , and had prepared every inch of hisroad . 
The President asked , why had he returned to France when he did , and notsooner ? 
He had not returned sooner , he replied , simply because he had no means ofliving in France , save those he had resigned ; whereas , in England , he lived bygiving instruction in the French language and literature . He had returned whenhe did , on the pressing and written entreaty of a French citizen , whorepresented that his life was endangered by his absence . He had come back , tosave a citizen's life , and to bear his testimony , at whatever personal hazard , to the truth . Was that criminal in the eyes of the Republic ? 
The populace cried enthusiastically , No ! and the President rang his bell toquiet them . Which it did not , for they continued to cry No ! until they leftoff , of their own will . 
The President required the name of that citizen . The accused explained thatthe citizen was his first witness . He also referred with confidence to thecitizen's letter , which had been taken from him at the Barrier , but which he didnot doubt would be found among the papers then before the President . 
The Doctor had taken care that it should be therehad assured him that itwould be thereand at this stage of the proceedings it was produced and read . Citizen Gabelle was called to confirm it , and did so . Citizen Gabelle hinted , with infinite delicacy and politeness , that in the pressure of business imposedon the Tribunal by the multitude of enemies of the Republic with which it had todeal , he had been slightly overlooked in his prison of the Abbayein fact , hadrather passed out of the Tribunal's patriotic remembranceuntil three days ago ; when he had been summoned before it , and had been set at liberty on the Jury'sdeclaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was answered , asto himself , by the surrender of the citizen Evremonde , called Darnay . 
Doctor Manette was next questioned . His high personal popularity , and theclearness of his answers , made a great impression ; but , as he proceeded , as heshowed that the Accused was his first friend on his release from his longimprisonment ; that , the accused had remained in England , always faithful anddevoted to his daughter and himself in their exile ; that , so far from being infavour with the Aristocrat government there , he had actually been tried for hislife by it , as the foe of England and friend of the United Statesas he broughtthese circumstances into view , with the greatest discretion and with thestraightforward force of truth and earnestness , the Jury and the populace becameone . At last , when he appealed by name to Monsieur Lorry , an English gentlemanthen and there present , who , like himself , had been a witness on that Englishtrial and could corroborate his account of it , the Jury declared that they hadheard enough , and that they were ready with their votes if the President werecontent to receive them . 
At every vote (the Jurymen voted aloud and individually) , the populace set upa shout of applause . All the voices were in the prisoner's favour , and thePresident declared him free . 
Then , began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populacesometimes gratified their fickleness , or their better impulses towardsgenerosity and mercy , or which they regarded as some set-off against theirswollen account of cruel rage . No man can decide now to which of these motivessuch extraordinary scenes were referable ; it is probable , to a blending of allthe three , with the second predominating . No sooner was the acquittalpronounced , than tears were shed as freely as blood at another time , and suchfraternal embraces were bestowed upon the prisoner by as many of both sexes ascould rush at him , that after his long and unwholesome confinement he was indanger of fainting from exhaustion ; none the less because he knew very well , that the very same people , carried by another current , would have rushed at himwith the very same intensity , to rend him to pieces and strew him over thestreets . 
His removal , to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried , rescued him from these caresses for the moment . Five were to be tried together , next , as enemies of the Republic , forasmuch as they had not assisted it by wordor deed . So quick was the Tribunal to compensate itself and the nation for achance lost , that these five came down to him before he left the place , condemned to die within twenty-four hours . The first of them told him so , withthe customary prison sign of Deatha raised fingerand they all added in words , Long live the Republic ! 
The five had had , it is true , no audience to lengthen their proceedings , forwhen he and Doctor Manette emerged from the gate , there was a great crowd aboutit , in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in Courtexcept two , forwhich he looked in vain . On his coming out , the concourse made at him anew , weeping , embracing , and shouting , all by turns and all together , until the verytide of the river on the bank of which the mad scene was acted , seemed to runmad , like the people on the shore . 
They put him into a great chair they had among them , and which they had takeneither out of the Court itself , or one of its rooms or passages . Over the chairthey had thrown a red flag , and to the back of it they had bound a pike with ared cap on its top . In this car of triumph , not even the Doctor's entreatiescould prevent his being carried to his home on men's shoulders , with a confusedsea of red caps heaving about him , and casting up to sight from the stormy deepsuch wrecks of faces , that he more than once misdoubted his mind being inconfusion , and that he was in the tumbril on his way to the Guillotine . 
In wild dreamlike procession , embracing whom they met and pointing him out , they carried him on . Reddening the snowy streets with the prevailing Republicancolour , in winding and tramping through them , as they had reddened them belowthe snow with a deeper dye , they carried him thus into the courtyard of thebuilding where he lived . Her father had gone on before , to prepare her , and whenher husband stood upon his feet , she dropped insensible in his arms . 
As he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his face andthe brawling crowd , so that his tears and her lips might come together unseen , afew of the people fell to dancing . Instantly , all the rest fell to dancing , andthe courtyard overflowed with the Carmagnole . Then , they elevated into thevacant chair a young woman from the crowd to be carried as the Goddess ofLiberty , and then swelling and overflowing out into the adjacent streets , andalong the river's bank , and over the bridge , the Carmagnole absorbed them everyone and whirled them away . 
After grasping the Doctor's hand , as he stood victorious and proud before him ; after grasping the hand of Mr . Lorry , who came panting in breathless from hisstruggle against the waterspout of the Carmagnole ; after kissing little Lucie , who was lifted up to clasp her arms round his neck ; and after embracing the everzealous and faithful Pross who lifted her ; he took his wife in his arms , andcarried her up to their rooms . 
Lucie ! My own ! I am safe . 
O dearest Charles , let me thank God for this on my knees as I have prayed toHim . 
They all reverently bowed their heads and hearts . When she was again in hisarms , he said to her : 
And now speak to your father , dearest . No other man in all this France couldhave done what he has done for me . 
She laid her head upon her father's breast , as she had laid his poor head onher own breast , long , long ago . He was happy in the return he had made her , hewas recompensed for his suffering , he was proud of his strength . You must notbe weak , my darling , he remonstrated ; don't tremble so . I have savedhim . 
I have saved him . It was not another of the dreams in which he had oftencome back ; he was really here . And yet his wife trembled , and a vague but heavyfear was upon her . 
All the air round was so thick and dark , the people were so passionatelyrevengeful and fitful , the innocent were so constantly put to death on vaguesuspicion and black malice , it was so impossible to forget that many asblameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to her , every dayshared the fate from which he had been clutched , that her heart could not be aslightened of its load as she felt it ought to be . The shadows of the wintryafternoon were beginning to fall , and even now the dreadful carts were rollingthrough the streets . Her mind pursued them , looking for him among the Condemned ; and then she clung closer to his real presence and trembled more . 
Her father , cheering her , showed a compassionate superiority to this woman'sweakness , which was wonderful to see . No garret , no shoemaking , no One Hundredand Five , North Tower , now ! He had accomplished the task he had set himself , hispromise was redeemed , he had saved Charles . Let them all lean upon him . 
Their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind : not only because that was thesafest way of life , involving the least offence to the people , but because theywere not rich , and Charles , throughout his imprisonment , had had to pay heavilyfor his bad food , and for his guard , and towards the living of the poorerprisoners . Partly on this account , and partly to avoid a domestic spy , they keptno servant ; the citizen and citizeness who acted as porters at the courtyardgate , rendered them occasional service ; and Jerry (almost wholly transferred tothem by Mr . Lorry) had become their daily retainer , and had his bed there everynight . 
It was an ordinance of the Republic One and Indivisible of Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death , that on the door or doorpost of every house , the name ofevery inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters of a certain size , at acertain convenient height from the ground . Mr . Jerry Cruncher's name , therefore , duly embellished the doorpost down below ; and , as the afternoon shadowsdeepened , the owner of that name himself appeared , from overlooking a painterwhom Doctor Manette had employed to add to the list the name of CharlesEvremonde , called Darnay . 
In the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time , all the usualharmless ways of life were changed . In the Doctor's little household , as in verymany others , the articles of daily consumption that were wanted were purchasedevery evening , in small quantities and at various small shops . To avoidattracting notice , and to give as little occasion as possible for talk and envy , was the general desire . 
For some months past , Miss Pross and Mr . Cruncher had discharged the office ofpurveyors ; the former carrying the money ; the latter , the basket . Everyafternoon at about the time when the public lamps were lighted , they fared forthon this duty , and made and brought home such purchases as were needful . AlthoughMiss Pross , through her long association with a French family , might have knownas much of their language as of her own , if she had had a mind , she had no mindin that direction ; consequently she knew no more of that nonsense (as she waspleased to call it) than Mr . Cruncher did . So her manner of marketing was toplump a noun-substantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any introduction inthe nature of an article , and , if it happened not to be the name of the thingshe wanted , to look round for that thing , lay hold of it , and hold on by ituntil the bargain was concluded . She always made a bargain for it , by holdingup , as a statement of its just price , one finger less than the merchant held up , whatever his number might be . 
Now , Mr . Cruncher , said Miss Pross , whose eyes were red with felicity ; ifyou are ready , I am . 
Jerry hoarsely professed himself at Miss Pross's service . He had worn all hisrust off long ago , but nothing would file his spiky head down . 
There's all manner of things wanted , said Miss Pross , and we shall have aprecious time of it . We want wine , among the rest . Nice toasts these Redheadswill be drinking , wherever we buy it . 
It will be much the same to your knowledge , miss , I should think , retortedJerry , whether they drink your health or the Old Un's . 
Who's he ? said Miss Pross . 
Mr . Cruncher , with some diffidence , explained himself as meaning OldNick's . 
Ha ! said Miss Pross , it doesn't need an interpreter to explain the meaningof these creatures . They have but one , and it's Midnight Murder , andMischief . 
Hush , dear ! Pray , pray , be cautious ! cried Lucie . 
Yes , yes , yes , I'll be cautious , said Miss Pross ; but I may say amongourselves , that I do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey smotherings inthe form of embracings all round , going on in the streets . Now , Ladybird , neveryou stir from that fire till I come back ! Take care of the dear husband you haverecovered , and don't move your pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now , till you see me again ! May I ask a question , Doctor Manette , before Igo ? 
I think you may take that liberty , the Doctor answered , smiling . 
For gracious sake , don't talk about Liberty ; we have quite enough of that , said Miss Pross . 
Hush , dear ! Again ? Lucie remonstrated . 
Well , my sweet , said Miss Pross , nodding her head emphatically , the shortand the long of it is , that I am a subject of His Most Gracious Majesty KingGeorge the Third ; Miss Pross curtseyed at the name ; and as such , my maxim is , Confound their politics , Frustrate their knavish tricks , On him our hopes wefix , God save the King ! 
Mr . Cruncher , in an access of loyalty , growlingly repeated the words afterMiss Pross , like somebody at church . 
I am glad you have so much of the Englishman in you , though I wish you hadnever taken that cold in your voice , said Miss Pross , approvingly . But thequestion , Doctor Manette . Is there it was the good creature's way to affect tomake light of anything that was a great anxiety with them all , and to come at itin this chance manneris there any prospect yet , of our getting out of thisplace ? 
I fear not yet . It would be dangerous for Charles yet . 
Heigh-ho-hum ! said Miss Pross , cheerfully repressing a sigh as she glancedat her darling's golden hair in the light of the fire , then we must havepatience and wait : that's all . We must hold up our heads and fight low , as mybrother Solomon used to say . Now , Mr . Cruncher ! Don't you move , Ladybird ! 
They went out , leaving Lucie , and her husband , her father , and the child , by abright fire . Mr . Lorry was expected back presently from the Banking House . MissPross had lighted the lamp , but had put it aside in a corner , that they mightenjoy the fire-light undisturbed . Little Lucie sat by her grandfather with herhands clasped through his arm : and he , in a tone not rising much above awhisper , began to tell her a story of a great and powerful Fairy who had openeda prison-wall and let out a captive who had once done the Fairy a service . Allwas subdued and quiet , and Lucie was more at ease than she had been . 
What is that ? she cried , all at once . 
My dear ! said her father , stopping in his story , and laying his hand onhers , command yourself . What a disordered state you are in ! The leastthingnothingstartles you ! YOU , your father's daughter ! 
I thought , my father , said Lucie , excusing herself , with a pale face and ina faltering voice , that I heard strange feet upon the stairs . 
My love , the staircase is as still as Death . As he said the word , a blow wasstruck upon the door . 
Oh father , father . What can this be ! Hide Charles . Save him ! 
My child , said the Doctor , rising , and laying his hand upon her shoulder , IHAVE saved him . What weakness is this , my dear ! Let me go to the door . 
He took the lamp in his hand , crossed the two intervening outer rooms , andopened it . A rude clattering of feet over the floor , and four rough men in redcaps , armed with sabres and pistols , entered the room . 
The Citizen Evremonde , called Darnay , said the first . 
Who seeks him ? answered Darnay . 
I seek him . We seek him . I know you , Evremonde ; I saw you before the Tribunalto-day . You are again the prisoner of the Republic . 
The four surrounded him , where he stood with his wife and child clinging tohim . 
Tell me how and why am I again a prisoner ? 
It is enough that you return straight to the Conciergerie , and will knowto-morrow . You are summoned for to-morrow . 
Doctor Manette , whom this visitation had so turned into stone , that he stoodwith the lamp in his hand , as if be woe a statue made to hold it , moved afterthese words were spoken , put the lamp down , and confronting the speaker , andtaking him , not ungently , by the loose front of his red woollen shirt , said : 
You know him , you have said . Do you know me ? 
Yes , I know you , Citizen Doctor . 
We all know you , Citizen Doctor , said the other three . 
He looked abstractedly from one to another , and said , in a lower voice , aftera pause : 
Will you answer his question to me then ? How does this happen ? 
Citizen Doctor , said the first , reluctantly , he has been denounced to theSection of Saint Antoine . This citizen , pointing out the second who hadentered , is from Saint Antoine . 
The citizen here indicated nodded his head , and added : 
He is accused by Saint Antoine . 
Of what ? asked the Doctor . 
Citizen Doctor , said the first , with his former reluctance , ask no more . Ifthe Republic demands sacrifices from you , without doubt you as a good patriotwill be happy to make them . The Republic goes before all . The People is supreme . Evremonde , we are pressed . 
One word , the Doctor entreated . Will you tell me who denounced him ? 
It is against rule , answered the first ; but you can ask Him of SaintAntoine here . 
The Doctor turned his eyes upon that man . Who moved uneasily on his feet , rubbed his beard a little , and at length said : 
Well ! Truly it is against rule . But he is denouncedand gravelyby theCitizen and Citizeness Defarge . And by one other . 
What other ? 
Do YOU ask , Citizen Doctor ? 
Yes . 
Then , said he of Saint Antoine , with a strange look , you will be answeredto-morrow . Now , I am dumb ! 
Happily unconscious of the new calamity at home , Miss Pross threaded her wayalong the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the Pont-Neuf , reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases she had to make . Mr . Cruncher , with the basket , walked at her side . They both looked to the right andto the left into most of the shops they passed , had a wary eye for allgregarious assemblages of people , and turned out of their road to avoid any veryexcited group of talkers . It was a raw evening , and the misty river , blurred tothe eye with blazing lights and to the ear with harsh noises , showed where thebarges were stationed in which the smiths worked , making guns for the Army ofthe Republic . Woe to the man who played tricks with THAT Army , or got undeservedpromotion in it ! Better for him that his beard had never grown , for the NationalRazor shaved him close . 
Having purchased a few small articles of grocery , and a measure of oil for thelamp , Miss Pross bethought herself of the wine they wanted . After peeping intoseveral wine-shops , she stopped at the sign of the Good Republican Brutus ofAntiquity , not far from the National Palace , once (and twice) the Tuileries , where the aspect of things rather took her fancy . It had a quieter look than anyother place of the same description they had passed , and , though red withpatriotic caps , was not so red as the rest . Sounding Mr . Cruncher , and findinghim of her opinion , Miss Pross resorted to the Good Republican Brutus ofAntiquity , attended by her cavalier . 
Slightly observant of the smoky lights ; of the people , pipe in mouth , playingwith limp cards and yellow dominoes ; of the one bare- breasted , bare-armed , soot-begrimed workman reading a journal aloud , and of the others listening tohim ; of the weapons worn , or laid aside to be resumed ; of the two or threecustomers fallen forward asleep , who in the popular high-shouldered shaggy blackspencer looked , in that attitude , like slumbering bears or dogs ; the twooutlandish customers approached the counter , and showed what they wanted . 
As their wine was measuring out , a man parted from another man in a corner , and rose to depart . In going , he had to face Miss Pross . No sooner did he faceher , than Miss Pross uttered a scream , and clapped her hands . 
In a moment , the whole company were on their feet . That somebody wasassassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the likeliestoccurrence . Everybody looked to see somebody fall , but only saw a man and awoman standing staring at each other ; the man with all the outward aspect of aFrenchman and a thorough Republican ; the woman , evidently English . 
What was said in this disappointing anti-climax , by the disciples of the GoodRepublican Brutus of Antiquity , except that it was something very voluble andloud , would have been as so much Hebrew or Chaldean to Miss Pross and herprotector , though they had been all ears . But , they had no ears for anything intheir surprise . For , it must be recorded , that not only was Miss Pross lost inamazement and agitation , but , Mr . Cruncherthough it seemed on his own separateand individual accountwas in a state of the greatest wonder . 
What is the matter ? said the man who had caused Miss Pross to scream ; speaking in a vexed , abrupt voice (though in a low tone) , and in English . 
Oh , Solomon , dear Solomon ! cried Miss Pross , clapping her hands again . After not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time , do I findyou here ! 
Don't call me Solomon . Do you want to be the death of me ? asked the man , ina furtive , frightened way . 
Brother , brother ! cried Miss Pross , bursting into tears . Have I ever beenso hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question ? 
Then hold your meddlesome tongue , said Solomon , and come out , if you wantto speak to me . Pay for your wine , and come out . Who's this man ? 
Miss Pross , shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no meansaffectionate brother , said through her tears , Mr . Cruncher . 
Let him come out too , said Solomon . Does he think me a ghost ? 
Apparently , Mr . Cruncher did , to judge from his looks . He said not a word , however , and Miss Pross , exploring the depths of her reticule through her tearswith great difficulty paid for her wine . As she did so , Solomon turned to thefollowers of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity , and offered a few words ofexplanation in the French language , which caused them all to relapse into theirformer places and pursuits . 
Now , said Solomon , stopping at the dark street corner , what do youwant ? 
How dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love awayfrom ! cried Miss Pross , to give me such a greeting , and show me noaffection . 
There . Confound it ! There , said Solomon , making a dab at Miss Pross's lipswith his own . Now are you content ? 
Miss Pross only shook her head and wept in silence . 
If you expect me to be surprised , said her brother Solomon , I am notsurprised ; I knew you were here ; I know of most people who are here . If youreally don't want to endanger my existencewhich I half believe you dogo yourways as soon as possible , and let me go mine . I am busy . I am anofficial . 
My English brother Solomon , mourned Miss Pross , casting up her tear-fraughteyes , that had the makings in him of one of the best and greatest of men in hisnative country , an official among foreigners , and such foreigners ! I wouldalmost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in his
I said so ! cried her brother , interrupting . I knew it . You want to be thedeath of me . I shall be rendered Suspected , by my own sister . Just as I amgetting on ! 
The gracious and merciful Heavens forbid ! cried Miss Pross . Far ratherwould I never see you again , dear Solomon , though I have ever loved you truly , and ever shall . Say but one affectionate word to me , and tell me there isnothing angry or estranged between us , and I will detain you no longer . 
Good Miss Pross ! As if the estrangement between them had come of anyculpability of hers . As if Mr . Lorry had not known it for a fact , years ago , inthe quiet corner in Soho , that this precious brother had spent her money andleft her ! 
He was saying the affectionate word , however , with a far more grudgingcondescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative meritsand positions had been reversed (which is invariably the case , all the worldover) , when Mr . Cruncher , touching him on the shoulder , hoarsely andunexpectedly interposed with the following singular question : 
I say ! Might I ask the favour ? As to whether your name is John Solomon , orSolomon John ? 
The official turned towards him with sudden distrust . He had not previouslyuttered a word . 
Come ! said Mr . Cruncher . Speak out , you know . (Which , by the way , was morethan he could do himself . ) John Solomon , or Solomon John ? She calls youSolomon , and she must know , being your sister . And I knowyou're John , you know . Which of the two goes first ? And regarding that name ofPross , likewise . That warn't your name over the water . 
What do you mean ? 
Well , I don't know all I mean , for I can't call to mind what your name was , over the water . 
No ? 
No . But I'll swear it was a name of two syllables . 
Indeed ? 
Yes . T'other one's was one syllable . I know you . You was a spywitness at theBailey . What , in the name of the Father of Lies , own father to yourself , was youcalled at that time ? 
Barsad , said another voice , striking in . 
That's the name for a thousand pound ! cried Jerry . 
The speaker who struck in , was Sydney Carton . He had his hands behind himunder the skirts of his riding-coat , and he stood at Mr . Cruncher's elbow asnegligently as he might have stood at the Old Bailey itself . 
Don't be alarmed , my dear Miss Pross . I arrived at Mr . Lorry's , to hissurprise , yesterday evening ; we agreed that I would not present myself elsewhereuntil all was well , or unless I could be useful ; I present myself here , to beg alittle talk with your brother . I wish you had a better employed brother than Mr . Barsad . I wish for your sake Mr . Barsad was not a Sheep of the Prisons . 
Sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy , under the gaolers . The spy , whowas pale , turned paler , and asked him how he dared
I'll tell you , said Sydney . I lighted on you , Mr . Barsad , coming out of theprison of the Conciergerie while I was contemplating the walls , an hour or moreago . You have a face to be remembered , and I remember faces well . Made curiousby seeing you in that connection , and having a reason , to which you are nostranger , for associating you with the misfortunes of a friend now veryunfortunate , I walked in your direction . I walked into the wine-shop here , closeafter you , and sat near you . I had no difficulty in deducing from yourunreserved conversation , and the rumour openly going about among your admirers , the nature of your calling . And gradually , what I had done at random , seemed toshape itself into a purpose , Mr . Barsad . 
What purpose ? the spy asked . 
It would be troublesome , and might be dangerous , to explain in the street . Could you favour me , in confidence , with some minutes of your companyat theoffice of Tellson's Bank , for instance ? 
Under a threat ? 
Oh ! Did I say that ? 
Then , why should I go there ? 
Really , Mr . Barsad , I can't say , if you can't . 
Do you mean that you won't say , sir ? the spy irresolutely asked . 
You apprehend me very clearly , Mr . Barsad . I won't . 
Carton's negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of hisquickness and skill , in such a business as he had in his secret mind , and withsuch a man as he had to do with . His practised eye saw it , and made the most ofit . 
Now , I told you so , said the spy , casting a reproachful look at his sister ; if any trouble comes of this , it's your doing . 
Come , come , Mr . Barsad ! exclaimed Sydney . Don't be ungrateful . But for mygreat respect for your sister , I might not have led up so pleasantly to a littleproposal that I wish to make for our mutual satisfaction . Do you go with me tothe Bank ? 
I'll hear what you have got to say . Yes , I'll go with you . 
I propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her ownstreet . Let me take your arm , Miss Pross . This is not a good city , at this time , for you to be out in , unprotected ; and as your escort knows Mr . Barsad , I willinvite him to Mr . Lorry's with us . Are we ready ? Come then ! 
Miss Pross recalled soon afterwards , and to the end of her life remembered , that as she pressed her hands on Sydney's arm and looked up in his face , imploring him to do no hurt to Solomon , there was a braced purpose in the armand a kind of inspiration in the eyes , which not only contradicted his lightmanner , but changed and raised the man . She was too much occupied then withfears for the brother who so little deserved her affection , and with Sydney'sfriendly reassurances , adequately to heed what she observed . 
They left her at the corner of the street , and Carton led the way to Mr . Lorry's , which was within a few minutes' walk . John Barsad , or Solomon Pross , walked at his side . 
Mr . Lorry had just finished his dinner , and was sitting before a cheery littlelog or two of fireperhaps looking into their blaze for the picture of thatyounger elderly gentleman from Tellson's , who had looked into the red coals atthe Royal George at Dover , now a good many years ago . He turned his head as theyentered , and showed the surprise with which he saw a stranger . 
Miss Pross's brother , sir , said Sydney . Mr . Barsad . 
Barsad ? repeated the old gentleman , Barsad ? I have an association with thenameand with the face . 
I told you you had a remarkable face , Mr . Barsad , observed Carton , coolly . Pray sit down . 
As he took a chair himself , he supplied the link that Mr . Lorry wanted , bysaying to him with a frown , Witness at that trial . Mr . Lorry immediatelyremembered , and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised look ofabhorrence . 
Mr . Barsad has been recognised by Miss Pross as the affectionate brother youhave heard of , said Sydney , and has acknowledged the relationship . I pass toworse news . Darnay has been arrested again . 
Struck with consternation , the old gentleman exclaimed , What do you tell me ! I left him safe and free within these two hours , and am about to return tohim ! 
Arrested for all that . When was it done , Mr . Barsad ? 
Just now , if at all . 
Mr . Barsad is the best authority possible , sir , said Sydney , and I have itfrom Mr . Barsad's communication to a friend and brother Sheep over a bottle ofwine , that the arrest has taken place . He left the messengers at the gate , andsaw them admitted by the porter . There is no earthly doubt that he isretaken . 
Mr . Lorry's business eye read in the speaker's face that it was loss of timeto dwell upon the point . Confused , but sensible that something might depend onhis presence of mind , he commanded himself , and was silently attentive . 
Now , I trust , said Sydney to him , that the name and influence of DoctorManette may stand him in as good stead to-morrowyou said he would be before theTribunal again to-morrow , Mr . Barsad ? 
Yes ; I believe so . 
In as good stead to-morrow as to-day . But it may not be so . I own to you , Iam shaken , Mr . Lorry , by Doctor Manette's not having had the power to preventthis arrest . 
He may not have known of it beforehand , said Mr . Lorry . 
But that very circumstance would be alarming , when we remember how identifiedhe is with his son-in-law . 
That's true , Mr . Lorry acknowledged , with his troubled hand at his chin , andhis troubled eyes on Carton . 
In short , said Sydney , this is a desperate time , when desperate games areplayed for desperate stakes . Let the Doctor play the winning game ; I will playthe losing one . No man's life here is worth purchase . Any one carried home bythe people to-day , may be condemned tomorrow . Now , the stake I have resolved toplay for , in case of the worst , is a friend in the Conciergerie . And the friendI purpose to myself to win , is Mr . Barsad . 
You need have good cards , sir , said the spy . 
I'll run them over . I'll see what I hold , Mr . Lorry , you know what a brute Iam ; I wish you'd give me a little brandy . 
It was put before him , and he drank off a glassfuldrank off anotherglassfulpushed the bottle thoughtfully away . 
Mr . Barsad , he went on , in the tone of one who really was looking over ahand at cards : Sheep of the prisons , emissary of Republican committees , nowturnkey , now prisoner , always spy and secret informer , so much the more valuablehere for being English that an Englishman is less open to suspicion ofsubornation in those characters than a Frenchman , represents himself to hisemployers under a false name . That's a very good card . Mr . Barsad , now in theemploy of the republican French government , was formerly in the employ of thearistocratic English government , the enemy of France and freedom . That's anexcellent card . Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion , that Mr . Barsad , still in the pay of the aristocratic English government , is the spy ofPitt , the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom , the Englishtraitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so difficult to find . That's a card not to be beaten . Have you followed my hand , Mr . Barsad ? 
Not to understand your play , returned the spy , somewhat uneasily . 
I play my Ace , Denunciation of Mr . Barsad to the nearest Section Committee . Look over your hand , Mr . Barsad , and see what you have . Don't hurry . 
He drew the bottle near , poured out another glassful of brandy , and drank itoff . He saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself into a fit statefor the immediate denunciation of him . Seeing it , he poured out and drankanother glassful . 
Look over your hand carefully , Mr . Barsad . Take time . 
It was a poorer hand than he suspected . Mr . Barsad saw losing cards in it thatSydney Carton knew nothing of . Thrown out of his honourable employment inEngland , through too much unsuccessful hard swearing therenot because he wasnot wanted there ; our English reasons for vaunting our superiority to secrecyand spies are of very modern datehe knew that he had crossed the Channel , andaccepted service in France : first , as a tempter and an eavesdropper among hisown countrymen there : gradually , as a tempter and an eavesdropper among thenatives . He knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy uponSaint Antoine and Defarge's wine-shop ; had received from the watchful policesuch heads of information concerning Doctor Manette's imprisonment , release , andhistory , as should serve him for an introduction to familiar conversation withthe Defarges ; and tried them on Madame Defarge , and had broken down with themsignally . He always remembered with fear and trembling , that that terrible womanhad knitted when he talked with her , and had looked ominously at him as herfingers moved . He had since seen her , in the Section of Saint Antoine , over andover again produce her knitted registers , and denounce people whose lives theguillotine then surely swallowed up . He knew , as every one employed as he wasdid , that he was never safe ; that flight was impossible ; that he was tied fastunder the shadow of the axe ; and that in spite of his utmost tergiversation andtreachery in furtherance of the reigning terror , a word might bring it down uponhim . Once denounced , and on such grave grounds as had just now been suggested tohis mind , he foresaw that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character hehad seen many proofs , would produce against him that fatal register , and wouldquash his last chance of life . Besides that all secret men are men soonterrified , here were surely cards enough of one black suit , to justify theholder in growing rather livid as he turned them over . 
You scarcely seem to like your hand , said Sydney , with the greatestcomposure . Do you play ? 
I think , sir , said the spy , in the meanest manner , as he turned to Mr . Lorry , I may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence , to put it tothis other gentleman , so much your junior , whether he can under anycircumstances reconcile it to his station to play that Ace of which he hasspoken . I admit that I am a spy , and that it is considered adiscreditable stationthough it must be filled by somebody ; but this gentlemanis no spy , and why should he so demean himself as to make himself one ? 
I play my Ace , Mr . Barsad , said Carton , taking the answer on himself , andlooking at his watch , without any scruple , in a very few minutes . 
I should have hoped , gentlemen both , said the spy , always striving to hookMr . Lorry into the discussion , that your respect for my sister
I could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finallyrelieving her of her brother , said Sydney Carton . 
You think not , sir ? 
I have thoroughly made up my mind about it . 
The smooth manner of the spy , curiously in dissonance with his ostentatiouslyrough dress , and probably with his usual demeanour , received such a check fromthe inscrutability of Carton , who was a mystery to wiser and honester men thanhe , that it faltered here and failed him . While he was at a loss , Carton said , resuming his former air of contemplating cards : 
And indeed , now I think again , I have a strong impression that I have anothergood card here , not yet enumerated . That friend and fellow-Sheep , who spoke ofhimself as pasturing in the country prisons ; who was he ? 
French . You don't know him , said the spy , quickly . 
French , eh ? repeated Carton , musing , and not appearing to notice him at all , though he echoed his word . Well ; he may be . 
Is , I assure you , said the spy ; though it's not important . 
Though it's not important , repeated Carton , in the same mechanicalwaythough it's not importantNo , it's not important . No . Yet I know theface . 
I think not . I am sure not . It can't be , said the spy . 
It-can't-be , muttered Sydney Carton , retrospectively , and idling his glass(which fortunately was a small one) again . Can't-be . Spoke good French . Yetlike a foreigner , I thought ? 
Provincial , said the spy . 
No . Foreign ! cried Carton , striking his open hand on the table , as a lightbroke clearly on his mind . Cly ! Disguised , but the same man . We had that manbefore us at the Old Bailey . 
Now , there you are hasty , sir , said Barsad , with a smile that gave hisaquiline nose an extra inclination to one side ; there you really give me anadvantage over you . Cly (who I will unreservedly admit , at this distance oftime , was a partner of mine) has been dead several years . I attended him in hislast illness . He was buried in London , at the church of SaintPancras-in-the-Fields . His unpopularity with the blackguard multitude at themoment prevented my following his remains , but I helped to lay him in hiscoffin . 
Here , Mr . Lorry became aware , from where he sat , of a most remarkable goblinshadow on the wall . Tracing it to its source , he discovered it to be caused by asudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the risen and stiff hair onMr . Cruncher's head . 
Let us be reasonable , said the spy , and let us be fair . To show you howmistaken you are , and what an unfounded assumption yours is , I will lay beforeyou a certificate of Cly's burial , which I happened to have carried in mypocket-book , with a hurried hand he produced and opened it , ever since . Thereit is . Oh , look at it , look at it ! You may take it in your hand ; it's noforgery . 
Here , Mr . Lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate , and Mr . Cruncher rose and stepped forward . His hair could not have been more violentlyon end , if it had been that moment dressed by the Cow with the crumpled horn inthe house that Jack built . 
Unseen by the spy , Mr . Cruncher stood at his side , and touched him on theshoulder like a ghostly bailiff . 
That there Roger Cly , master , said Mr . Cruncher , with a taciturn andiron-bound visage . So YOU put him in his coffin ? 
I did . 
Who took him out of it ? 
Barsad leaned back in his chair , and stammered , What do you mean ? 
I mean , said Mr . Cruncher , that he warn't never in it . No ! Not he ! I'llhave my head took off , if he was ever in it . 
The spy looked round at the two gentlemen ; they both looked in unspeakableastonishment at Jerry . 
I tell you , said Jerry , that you buried paving-stones and earth in thatthere coffin . Don't go and tell me that you buried Cly . It was a take in . Me andtwo more knows it . 
How do you know it ? 
What's that to you ? Ecod ! growled Mr . Cruncher , it's you I have got a oldgrudge again , is it , with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen ! I'd catchhold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea . 
Sydney Carton , who , with Mr . Lorry , had been lost in amazement at this turn ofthe business , here requested Mr . Cruncher to moderate and explainhimself . 
At another time , sir , he returned , evasively , the present time isill-conwenient for explainin' . What I stand to , is , that he knows well wot thatthere Cly was never in that there coffin . Let him say he was , in so much as aword of one syllable , and I'll either catch hold of his throat and choke him forhalf a guinea ; Mr . Cruncher dwelt upon this as quite a liberal offer ; or I'llout and announce him . 
Humph ! I see one thing , said Carton . I hold another card , Mr . Barsad . Impossible , here in raging Paris , with Suspicion filling the air , for you tooutlive denunciation , when you are in communication with another aristocraticspy of the same antecedents as yourself , who , moreover , has the mystery abouthim of having feigned death and come to life again ! A plot in the prisons , ofthe foreigner against the Republic . A strong carda certain Guillotine card ! Doyou play ? 
No ! returned the spy . I throw up . I confess that we were so unpopular withthe outrageous mob , that I only got away from England at the risk of beingducked to death , and that Cly was so ferreted up and down , that he never wouldhave got away at all but for that sham . Though how this man knows it was a sham , is a wonder of wonders to me . 
Never you trouble your head about this man , retorted the contentious Mr . Cruncher ; you'll have trouble enough with giving your attention to thatgentleman . And look here ! Once more ! Mr . Cruncher could not be restrained frommaking rather an ostentatious parade of his liberalityI'd catch hold of yourthroat and choke you for half a guinea . 
The Sheep of the prisons turned from him to Sydney Carton , and said , with moredecision , It has come to a point . I go on duty soon , and can't overstay mytime . You told me you had a proposal ; what is it ? Now , it is of no use askingtoo much of me . Ask me to do anything in my office , putting my head in greatextra danger , and I had better trust my life to the chances of a refusal thanthe chances of consent . In short , I should make that choice . You talk ofdesperation . We are all desperate here . Remember ! I may denounce you if I thinkproper , and I can swear my way through stone walls , and so can others . Now , whatdo you want with me ? 
Not very much . You are a turnkey at the Conciergerie ? 
I tell you once for all , there is no such thing as an escape possible , saidthe spy , firmly . 
Why need you tell me what I have not asked ? You are a turnkey at theConciergerie ? 
I am sometimes . 
You can be when you choose ? 
I can pass in and out when I choose . 
Sydney Carton filled another glass with brandy , poured it slowly out upon thehearth , and watched it as it dropped . It being all spent , he said , rising : 
So far , we have spoken before these two , because it was as well that themerits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me . Come into thedark room here , and let us have one final word alone . 
While Sydney Carton and the Sheep of the prisons were in the adjoining darkroom , speaking so low that not a sound was heard , Mr . Lorry looked at Jerry inconsiderable doubt and mistrust . That honest tradesman's manner of receiving thelook , did not inspire confidence ; he changed the leg on which he rested , asoften as if he had fifty of those limbs , and were trying them all ; he examinedhis finger-nails with a very questionable closeness of attention ; and wheneverMr . Lorry's eye caught his , he was taken with that peculiar kind of short coughrequiring the hollow of a hand before it , which is seldom , if ever , known to bean infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character . 
Jerry , said Mr . Lorry . Come here . 
Mr . Cruncher came forward sideways , with one of his shoulders in advance ofhim . 
What have you been , besides a messenger ? 
After some cogitation , accompanied with an intent look at his patron , Mr . Cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying , Agicultooralcharacter . 
My mind misgives me much , said Mr . Lorry , angrily shaking a forefinger athim , that you have used the respectable and great house of Tellson's as ablind , and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous description . If you have , don't expect me to befriend you when you get back to England . Ifyou have , don't expect me to keep your secret . Tellson's shall not be imposedupon . 
I hope , sir , pleaded the abashed Mr . Cruncher , that a gentleman likeyourself wot I've had the honour of odd jobbing till I'm grey at it , would thinktwice about harming of me , even if it wos soI don't say it is , but even if itwos . And which it is to be took into account that if it wos , it wouldn't , eventhen , be all o' one side . There'd be two sides to it . There might be medicaldoctors at the present hour , a picking up their guineas where a honest tradesmandon't pick up his fardensfardens ! no , nor yet his half fardenshalf fardens ! no , nor yet his quartera banking away like smoke at Tellson's , and a cockingtheir medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly , a going in and going out totheir own carriagesah ! Equally like smoke , if not more so . Well , that ud beimposing , too , on Tellson's . For you cannot sarse the goose and not the gander . And here's Mrs . Cruncher , or leastways wos in the Old England times , and wouldbe to-morrow , if cause given , a floppin' again the business to that degree as isruinatingstark ruinating ! Whereas them medical doctors' wives don't flopcatchem at it ! Or , if they flop , their toppings goes in favour of more patients , andhow can you rightly have one without t'other ? Then , wot with undertakers , andwot with parish clerks , and wot with sextons , and wot with private watchmen (allawaricious and all in it) , a man wouldn't get much by it , even if it wos so . Andwot little a man did get , would never prosper with him , Mr . Lorry . He'd neverhave no good of it ; he'd want all along to be out of the line , if he , could seehis way out , being once ineven if it wos so . 
Ugh ! cried Mr . Lorry , rather relenting , nevertheless , I am shocked at thesight of you . 
Now , what I would humbly offer to you , sir , pursued Mr . Cruncher , even ifit wos so , which I don't say it is
Don't prevaricate , said Mr . Lorry . 
No , I will NOT , sir , returned Mr . Crunches as if nothing were further fromhis thoughts or practicewhich I don't say it iswot I would humbly offer toyou , sir , would be this . Upon that there stool , at that there Bar , sets thatthere boy of mine , brought up and growed up to be a man , wot will errand you , message you , general-light-job you , till your heels is where your head is , ifsuch should be your wishes . If it wos so , which I still don't say it is (for Iwill not prewaricate to you , sir) , let that there boy keep his father's place , and take care of his mother ; don't blow upon that boy's fatherdo not do it , sirand let that father go into the line of the reg'lar diggin' , and make amendsfor what he would have undugif it wos soby diggin' of em in with a will , andwith conwictions respectin' the futur' keepin' of em safe . That , Mr . Lorry , said Mr . Cruncher , wiping his forehead with his arm , as an announcement that hehad arrived at the peroration of his discourse , is wot I would respectfullyoffer to you , sir . A man don't see all this here a goin' on dreadful round him , in the way of Subjects without heads , dear me , plentiful enough fur to bring theprice down to porterage and hardly that , without havin' his serious thoughts ofthings . And these here would be mine , if it wos so , entreatin' of you fur tobear in mind that wot I said just now , I up and said in the good cause when Imight have kep' it back . 
That at least is true , said Mr . Lorry . Say no more now . It may be that Ishall yet stand your friend , if you deserve it , and repent in actionnot inwords . I want no more words . 
Mr . Cruncher knuckled his forehead , as Sydney Carton and the spy returned fromthe dark room . Adieu , Mr . Barsad , said the former ; our arrangement thus made , you have nothing to fear from me . 
He sat down in a chair on the hearth , over against Mr . Lorry . When they werealone , Mr . Lorry asked him what he had done ? 
Not much . If it should go ill with the prisoner , I have ensured access tohim , once . 
Mr . Lorry's countenance fell . 
It is all I could do , said Carton . To propose too much , would be to putthis man's head under the axe , and , as he himself said , nothing worse couldhappen to him if he were denounced . It was obviously the weakness of theposition . There is no help for it . 
But access to him , said Mr . Lorry , if it should go ill before the Tribunal , will not save him . 
I never said it would . 
Mr . Lorry's eyes gradually sought the fire ; his sympathy with his darling , andthe heavy disappointment of his second arrest , gradually weakened them ; he wasan old man now , overborne with anxiety of late , and his tears fell . 
You are a good man and a true friend , said Carton , in an altered voice . Forgive me if I notice that you are affected . I could not see my father weep , and sit by , careless . And I could not respect your sorrow more , if you were myfather . You are free from that misfortune , however . 
Though he said the last words , with a slip into his usual manner , there was atrue feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch , that Mr . Lorry , whohad never seen the better side of him , was wholly unprepared for . He gave himhis hand , and Carton gently pressed it . 
To return to poor Darnay , said Carton . Don't tell Her of this interview , orthis arrangement . It would not enable Her to go to see him . She might think itwas contrived , in case of the worse , to convey to him the means of anticipatingthe sentence . 
Mr . Lorry had not thought of that , and he looked quickly at Carton to see ifit were in his mind . It seemed to be ; he returned the look , and evidentlyunderstood it . 
She might think a thousand things , Carton said , and any of them would onlyadd to her trouble . Don't speak of me to her . As I said to you when I firstcame , I had better not see her . I can put my hand out , to do any little helpfulwork for her that my hand can find to do , without that . You are going to her , Ihope ? She must be very desolate to-night . 
I am going now , directly . 
I am glad of that . She has such a strong attachment to you and reliance onyou . How does she look ? 
Anxious and unhappy , but very beautiful . 
Ah ! 
It was a long , grieving sound , like a sighalmost like a sob . It attracted Mr . Lorry's eyes to Carton's face , which was turned to the fire . A light , or a shade(the old gentleman could not have said which) , passed from it as swiftly as achange will sweep over a hill-side on a wild bright day , and he lifted his footto put back one of the little flaming logs , which was tumbling forward . He worethe white riding-coat and top-boots , then in vogue , and the light of the firetouching their light surfaces made him look very pale , with his long brown hair , all untrimmed , hanging loose about him . His indifference to fire wassufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from Mr . Lorry ; hisboot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log , when it had broken underthe weight of his foot . 
I forgot it , he said . 
Mr . Lorry's eyes were again attracted to his face . Taking note of the wastedair which clouded the naturally handsome features , and having the expression ofprisoners' faces fresh in his mind , he was strongly reminded of thatexpression . 
And your duties here have drawn to an end , sir ? said Carton , turning tohim . 
Yes . As I was telling you last night when Lucie came in so unexpectedly , Ihave at length done all that I can do here . I hoped to have left them in perfectsafety , and then to have quitted Paris . I have my Leave to Pass . I was ready togo .
