 It was one of the best and worst times in history . It was a time of great intelligence and ignorance , belief and disbelief , good and evil , hope and hopelessness . We had everything to live for , and we had nothing to live for . Everyone was going straight to Heaven and straight to hell . Basically , it was just like the present 1859 , the time at which Dickens was writing the present , with experts of the time insisting on seeing its events only in terms of contrasting extremes . 
 A stern-looking king and a plain-looking queen ruled England . A stern-looking king and a beautiful queen ruled France . In both countries , it seemed obvious to the people managing the royal food supplies that things were stable and nothing would ever change . It was 1775 . People in England were as superstitious then as they are now . Mrs . Southcott a woman who claimed to be a prophet Mrs . Southcott had just turned twenty-five , and a private in the British army who claimed he could tell the future announced her appearance by saying that London and Westminster would be destroyed . 
 Even the Cock Lane Ghost the ghost of a woman believed to haunt a house on Cock Lane Cock Lane Ghost had only been gone twelve years since last tapping out its messages , as the very unoriginal ghosts of last year tapped out theirs . A group of British subjects in the American colonies the First Continental Congress group of British subjects in the American colonies had recently sent messages to the King of England , and oddly enough , these earthly messages proved more important than any of the supernatural ones from Cock Lane . 
 France , which was less interested in spiritual matters than England , was headed straight toward disaster , printing lots of paper money and spending all of it . Under the leadership of the clergy , the French government entertained itself with such activities as cutting off a young man's hands , pulling his tongue out with pliers , and burning him alive . The French government did this because the man didn't kneel down in the rain to pay tribute to a group of dirty monks walking by fifty or sixty yards away . While this young man was being put to death , trees were growing in the forests of France and Norway that Fate had decided would one day be used to make the guillotines that would play a terrible role in history . 
 All of these events , and a thousand others like them , happened in and around the year 1775 . In this atmosphere , with Death and Fate working quietly , those stern-looking kings and plain and beautiful queens of England and France carried on confidently , ruling by their divine right with a high hand . Through it all , Fate and Death worked without impediment . And so , in 1775 , these two royal couples , and many of their citizens whose stories are told in this book , headed toward their destinies . 
 This story starts with a man traveling along the road to Dover on a Friday night in late November . The Dover mail coach was also on the road and was moving slowly up Shooter's Hill . The man walked up the hill in the mud next to the mail coach , as did the rest of the coach's passengers . The passengers weren't walking because they wanted exercise ; they were walking because the hill , the harness , the mud , and the weight of the mail made the coach so heavy that the horses pulling it had already stopped three times . The horses had even tried to turn around and drag the coach back to Blackheath , an act equivalent to mutiny . 
 With their heads bowed down and their tails shaking , the horses stomped their way through the thick mud , struggling and tripping as if they were coming apart at their joints . Whenever the coachman stopped them , yelling Wo-ho ! so-ho-then ! the lead horse would violently shake his head , as if he were trying to tell the driver that the coach would never make it . Each time the lead horse shook like this , one of the nervous passengers would jump , and feel uneasy . 
 A steam-like mist moved gloomily up the hill , like a ghost looking for a place to rest , but finding none . The mist was cold and damp , and it moved slowly through the air in ripples that flowed on top of one another like the waves of a rough sea . It was so thick that all that could be seen by the light of the coach lamps was the mist itself and a few yards of the road . Steam rose off the struggling horses and mixed with the mist , as if the mist were coming from the horses themselves . 
 The two other passengers , beside the one already mentioned , were also plodding their way up the hill beside the mail coach . All three men were bundled up all the way to their ears and wore high boots . They were so covered up that not one of them could say what the others looked like , and all were so secretive that their minds were just as hidden as their faces . In those days , travelers kept to themselves , because anyone on the road could be a robber or in league with robbers . 
 Every inn and alehouse had someone in it working for thieves , from the landlord down to the lowliest stable boyanyone could be a criminal . This is what the guard of the Dover mail coach thought to himself that Friday night in November 1775 , as the mail coach lumbered up Shooter's Hill and the guard stood at his place on the back , stomping his feet and staying close to the chest of weapons . In the chest was a loaded blunderbuss an early form of shotgun with a short barrel blunderbuss , six or eight handguns , and a layer of swords at the bottom . 
 The mood in the Dover mail coach was friendly as usual : the guard suspected the passengers , the passengers suspected each other and the guard , everyone was suspicious of everyone else , and the driver trusted no one but the horses , though he would have sworn on the Bible that they were not strong enough to make the trip . Wo-ho ! shouted the driver to the horses . One more tug and you'll be at the top of the hill , and damn you for all the trouble it took to get you there ! Joe ! Hello ! the guard replied . What time do you think it is , Joe ? Ten minutes past eleven . And we're not to the top of Shooter's Hill yet ! yelled the angry driver . Yah ! Get a move on ! 
 The driver struck the lead horse with his whip , and the horse made a strong push up the hill as the other horses followed . The Dover mail coach pushed on once again , with the high boots of the passengers squashing through the mud next to it . When the coach stopped , the passengers stopped and stayed close beside it . If any of them had been brave enough to suggest they walk ahead into the mist and darkness , one of the others would have suspected him of being a highway robber and shot him . 
 The last push moved the mail coach to the top of the hill . The horses stopped to catch their breath . The guard got down to set the brake for the descent down the hill , and to open the coach door to let the passengers in . Hey , Joe ! yelled the driver in a warning voice , looking down from the top of the coach . What is it , Tom ? They both listened . Sounds like a horse trotting toward us , Joe . I'd say that horse is moving faster than that , Tom , replied the guard . He let go of the door and jumped back to his place on the coach . Gentlemen , in the name of the king , get back in the coach ! 
 With this hurried command , he cocked the gun , and stood ready to fire . The passenger followed throughout this book was on the coach step getting in . The other two passengers were right behind him , about to follow . He remained on the step , half in the coach and half out . They all looked back and forth between the driver and the guard , listening . The driver and the guard looked back at the passengers , and even the lead horse listened and looked back at them . 
 It became very quiet once the rumbling and struggling of the mail coach had stopped , adding to the stillness of the night . The panting of the horses made the mail coach shake as if it , too , were nervous . The passengers' hearts beat so loudly it was as if they could be heard outside their bodies . But the quietness reflected the emotions of the passengers , who were out of breath , and holding their breath , their heartbeats speeding up in expectation . 
 The sound of a horse running came quickly and furiously up the hill . Halt ! yelled the guard as loud as he could . You there ! Stop or I'll shoot ! The horse suddenly slowed with a lot of splashing and stumbling . A man's voice called from the mist , Is that the Dover mail coach ? Never mind what it is ! answered the guard . Who are you ? Is that the Dover mail coach ? Why do you want to know ? If it is , I'm looking for one of the passengers . Which passenger ? Mr . Jarvis Lorry . 
 Our character said that he was Mr . Jarvis Lorry . The guard , the driver , and the two other passengers looked at him distrustfully . Stay where you are , the guard yelled to the man in the mist . I don't want to make a mistake and shoot you . The man named Lorry , speak up !  What's the matter ? asked the passenger , in a slightly trembling voice . Who's looking for me ? Is it Jerry ? 
 If that is Jerry , I don't like the sound of his voice , the guard muttered to himself . It's scratchier than I'd care for . Yes , Mr . Lorry . What's the matter ? I have a letter for you from T . and Company . I know this messenger , guard , said Mr . Lorry , exiting the coach onto the road . The other two passengers helped him from behind , though not very politely , then immediately climbed into the coach , shut the door , and closed the window . He can come close . There's nothing to worry about . 
 I hope not , but I can't be sure of that , grumbled the guard to himself . Hey , you ! he said to Jerry . Hey to you ! said Jerry , raspier than before . Come over slowly , do you hear me ? And if you've got gun holsters on your saddle , don't let me see your hands go near them . I'm quick to make a mistake , and my mistakes usually involve bullets . Let me see you . 
 The figures of a horse and rider came slowly out of the swirling mist and over to the side of the mail coach , where the passenger was standing . The rider bent down , and keeping an eye on the guard , handed the passenger a small folded piece of paper . The rider's horse was exhausted , and both the horse and rider were covered in mud , from the hoofs of the horse to the rider's hat . Guard ! said the passenger in a confidential tone . 
 The guard stood ready , his right hand on the handle of the blunderbuss and his left on the barrel . His eyes were on the horseman , and he answered curtly , Sir . There's nothing to worry about . I work at Tellson's Bank . You must know Tellson's Bank in London . I'm going to Paris on business . I'll give you money to buy yourself a drink . Will you let me read this ? If you do it quickly , sir . He opened it in the light of the coach lamp , and read it to himself first and then aloud : Wait at Dover for Mademoiselle . ' It's a short message , you see , guard . Jerry , tell them my answer was ëBrought back to life . '
 Jerry jumped in his saddle . That's a very strange answer , he said , raspier than ever . Give them that reply and they will know that I understood their message as if I'd written it myself . Have a good trip back . Good night .  With that , Mr . Lorry opened the coach door and got in . He wasn't helped by the other passengers , who had quietly hidden their watches and purses in their boots and were pretending to be asleep . They wanted only to avoid trouble . 
 The mail coach pushed on again , with a heavier mist closing round it as it began to move down the hill . The guard soon put his blunderbuss back inside the chest and checked on the rest of the weapons . Having done that , he checked on the extra pistols he wore on his belt , and then checked on the smaller chest under his seat , in which he kept some blacksmithing tools , a couple of torches , and a box of kindling for starting fires . 
 The guard was so well prepared that if the coach lamps went out , which happened sometimes , he could easily light them again from inside the coach within five minutes (if he were lucky) . Tom ! said Joe quietly over the top of the coach . Yeah , Joe . Did you hear that message ? I did , Joe . What do you think it meant , Tom ? Nothing , Joe . 
 That's a coincidence , Joe said , I thought the same thing myself . Jerry , left alone in the dark mist , got down to give his tired horse a rest , wipe the mud off his face , and shake the water from his wide hat brim , which could probably hold half a gallon . He waited there with his bridle on his wet , muddy arm until he could no longer hear the wheels of the mail coach and the night was still again . Then he turned to walk down the hill . 
 After galloping all the way from Temple Bar , old lady , I won't ride you again until we get to level ground , said the raspy-voiced messenger , looking at his horse . Brought back to life . ' That's a very strange message . You wouldn't like that , Jerry . You'd be in trouble if dead people started coming back to life ! 
 In a way , our secrets make us all equals . Jerry , the messenger , possessed as many secrets as the king , or the first minister of state , or the richest businessman in London . The same is true of the three passengers closed up in the lumbering old mail coach . They were all mysteries to each other , as unknown to each other as if they had each been in different coaches , traveling in completely different places . 
 The messenger rode slowly back , stopping often at alehouses along the way to drink , but keeping to himself , with his hat angled over his eyes . His eyes , which fit him well , were solid black and much too close together , as if each eye feared being caught at something if it were too far from the other . They peered out menacingly from under his old hat , which was pulled down low and looked like a three-sided spittoon a receptacle for tobacco chewers to spit into three-sided spittoon . And they looked out over the large scarf that covered his chin and throat and went down nearly to his knees . When he stopped for a drink , he would remove the scarf with his left hand while he drank with his right , and as soon as he was done , he would cover his face again .  
 He was so confused by the message that he kept taking off his hat to scratch his head . Except on the very top of his head , which was bald , he had stiff , black hair that stuck up in spikes all over his head and grew almost down to his large , wide nose . His hair looked so much like metal spikes that the world's best leapfrog players might have refused to jump over him , thinking it too dangerous . 
 He rode back with the message , which he was to deliver to the night watchman at the door of Tellson's Bank , next to Temple Bar . The watchman was to deliver it to important people inside . While the messenger rode , the shadows of the night seemed to take the form of the dead returning to life , like the message had said . His horse also saw shapes in the darkness arising out of her private fears . Those fears must have been numerous , for she jumped at every shadow on the road . 
 A great number of customers withdrew their money from Tellson's Bank through the mail carried by the mail coach . As Mr . Lorry nodded off , with his arm through a leather strap to keep him from banging against the passenger beside him and pushing him into the corner , he dreamed the mail coach was the bank itself on a busy day . 
 The sound of the rattling harness became the jingle of coins , and more checks were cashed in five minutes than Tellson's , with its many local and foreign clients , had cashed in three times that period . He dreamt that the bank vaults under Tellson's , with all of their valuables and secrets (and he knew plenty about them) , opened up in front of him . He walked through them with his large keys and a dim candle and found everything safe and sound , just as he had left it . 
 Although he thought constantly of the bank , and although he remained vaguely aware that he was still in the coach (the way you are only vaguely aware of pain when on a pain-killer) , another thought ran through his mind all night . He had the feeling that he was on his way to dig someone out of a grave . 
 Now , although several faces appeared in front of him in the night , he couldn't determine which was the face of the buried person . All the faces belonged to a forty-five-year-old man , but they all differed in the expression they wore , and in how worn-out they looked . One facial expression followed another : pride , contempt , defiance , stubbornness , submission , and lamentation . Some had sunken cheeks , sickly pale skin , hands and bodies that had wasted away . But it was almost always the same face , and every head of hair had gone prematurely white . In his dream , Mr . Lorry asked the ghostly figure a hundred times : 
 How long had you been buried ? The answer was always the same : Almost eighteen years . Had you given up hope of being dug up ? Yes , a long time ago .  Do you know that you've been brought back to life ? That's what they tell me . You want to live , don't you ? I don't know . Should I show her to you ? Will you come see her ? 
 The ghostly figured answered this question in different and contradictory ways . Sometimes he answered weakly : Wait ! I would die if I saw her too soon . Sometimes he cried tenderly and said , Take me to her . Sometimes he became confused and answered , I don't know her . I don't understand . 
 After these imaginary conversations , Mr . Lorry would dream that he was digging the man outsometimes with a spade , sometimes a shovel , and sometimes his hands . Once the man was dug out , with dirt clinging to his face and hair , he would suddenly turn to dust . This would startle Mr . Lorry and wake him . He would open the window to allow the feeling of mist and rain on his face to bring him back to reality . 
 But even when Mr . Lorry was fully awake , looking at the mist and rain , the light from the lamps , the hedge passing by at the roadside , the shadows outside the coach would blend together with the shadows within . The real bank at Temple Bar , the real business of the day before , the real bank vaults , the real message he had received , and the real message he sent back would still be there . But the ghostly face would rise up and appear to him again . 
 How long have you been buried ? Almost eighteen years . You want to live , don't you ? I don't know . In his dream , Mr . Lorry would continue to dig until one of the other two passengers would wake him and tell him to close the window . Then he would put his arm securely through the leather strap and think about the two sleeping passengers , until he fell back asleep and began once again to dream about the bank and the grave . 
 How long had you been buried ? Almost eighteen years . Had you given up all hope of being dug out ? Yes , a long time ago . Mr . Lorry could still hear those words , as clearly as if they had just been spoken in real life , when he woke to realize it was daylight , and the shadows of the night were all gone . 
 He opened the window and looked out at the rising sun . He saw a field , with a plow sitting where it had been left the night before when the horses were untied from it . Further in the distance , he saw a quiet forest , where the bright red and golden yellow leaves remained on the trees . Though the ground was cold and wet , the sky was clear and the sun rose , bright , calm , and beautiful . 
 Eighteen years ! said the passenger , looking at the sun . Good God ! Imagine being buried alive for eighteen years ! When the coach reached Dover late in the morning , the head attendant at the Royal George Hotel opened the coach door . He did it with a grand gesture , because a trip from London to Dover during the winter was difficult , and making the journey was an achievement worth congratulating . 
 By that time , there was only one passenger to congratulate . The other two had gotten out at their destinations . The mildewy interior of the coach , with its damp and dirty straw , its unpleasant smell , and its darkness , was like the inside of a large dog cage . Mr . Lorry , shaking off the straw and dressed in his shaggy coat , floppy hat , and with his legs covered in mud , looked like a large dog himself . 
 Will there be a mail boat to Calais tomorrow , attendant ? Yes , sir , if we still have good weather and the wind is decent . The tide will be good for setting out at about two in the afternoon , sir . Would you like a bed , sir ? I won't go to bed until tonight , but I would like a bedroom and a barber . And then breakfast , sir ? Yes , sir . This way , sir , please . Staff ! Show him to the Concord room ! Bring the gentleman's suitcase and some hot water . Pull off the gentleman's boots . (You will find a nice coal fire there , sir . ) Bring the barber ! Get going ! 
 The Concord room was always given to passengers from the mail coach , and these passengers were always heavily bundled up when they entered . For this reason , the room was a bit of a curiosity : everyone who went in looked the same , but when they came out they all looked different . This is why a steward , two porters , several maids , and the landlady all happened to be standing around between the Concord room and the coffee room , when a sixty-year-old gentleman , dressed up in a worn but tidy brown suit with large cuffs and flaps on his pockets , passed by on his way to breakfast . 
 The gentleman in the brown suit was the only person in the coffee room that morning . His table was near the fire , and he sat so still as he waited for his food that , with the firelight on him , he looked as though he was having his portrait painted . He looked very neat , with a hand resting on each knee , and his watch ticking loudly and seriously under his flapped waistcoat , contrasting with the playful flickering of the fire . 
 He was proud of his legs and wore thin , tight brown stockings to show them off . His shoes and shoe buckles , though plain , were well-kept . He wore a strange shiny blond wig that sat tightly on his head . The wig looked like it was made from strands of silk or glass rather than from hair . His clothes , though not as nice as his stockings , were as white as the tops of the waves that broke on the beach nearby , or the sails of boats glinting in the sun far out at sea . 
 His face was calm and reserved , but his moist , bright eyes twinkled from under his wig . It must have been hard for him to train his bright eyes to take on the dull expression of the employees of Tellson's Bank . His cheeks were a healthy color , and though his face had some wrinkles , it showed few signs of anxiety . Perhaps the clerks at Tellson's Bank were mainly concerned with other people's problems , and maybe other people's problems , like secondhand clothes , are easy to put on and take off . 
 Completing his resemblance to a man having his portrait painted , Mr . Lorry fell asleep . The arrival of his breakfast woke him , and he said to the attendant , as he moved his chair up to the table : I would like you to get a room ready for a young woman who may arrive here at any time today . She may ask for Mr . Jarvis Lorry , or she may just ask for a gentleman from Tellson's Bank . Please let me know when she arrives . 
 Yes , sir . Tellson's Bank in London , sir ? Yes . Yes , sir . We often have the honor of hosting you gentlemen as you travel between London and Paris , sir . Tellson and Company employees travel a great deal , sir . Yes . We are very much a French business , as well as an English one . Yes , sir . You don't frequently do the traveling yourself , do you sir ? Not in recent years . It's been fifteen years since wesince Ilast came back from France . 
 Really , sir ? That was before I worked here , sir . Before the new owners bought this place , sir . The George Hotel was owned by other people back then , sir . 
 I believe it was . But I would bet , sir , that a bank like Tellson and Company was thriving fifty , not to mention fifteen , years ago ? You could triple that and say a hundred and fifty . Really , sir ! The waiter opened wide his mouth and eyes as he stepped back from the table . He moved his napkin from his right arm to his left , shifted into a casual stance , and stood watching while Mr . Lorry ate and drank . The waiter watched as though looking from a watchtower , as waiters have always done . When Mr . Lorry had finished breakfast , he went out for a stroll on the beach . 
 The cramped , crooked town of Dover couldn't be seen from the beach , as though it were hiding , and it extended all the way to the chalk cliffs . The sea tossed stones wildly about on the beach . It did what it liked , and what it liked was destruction . It threatened the town by crashing angrily against the cliffs . The air around the houses had such a fishy smell that one might have thought sick fish went to the water to dip themselves in it , just as sick people sometimes do . 
 Not much fishing was done in the port , but suspicious-looking people were always wandering along the water at night Dover was known as a smuggling port suspicious-looking people were always wandering along the water at night , particularly at high tide . Small businessmen who didn't work at all sometimes mysteriously came upon large fortunes for no apparent reason , and for some strange reason , nobody could tolerate the lamps being lit at night . 
 As afternoon came on , the air , which at times was clear enough that one could see the French coast , clouded over with mist and fog . Mr . Lorry's mood seemed to cloud over as well . When it got dark , he sat in front of the coffee-room fire , awaiting his dinner just as he had awaited his breakfast . He imagined he was digging again as he stared into the red coals of the fire . 
 Mr . Lorry drank a bottle of good red wine after dinner , causing him to lose interest in work . He had been sitting there for a long time and had just poured out his last glassful of winewith as happy an expression as any elderly gentleman can have after drinking most of a bottlewhen he heard the rattling of wheels coming up the street and pulling into the inn's yard . 
 He put down his glass without drinking . Mademoiselle is here ! he said . In just a few minutes the waiter came in to tell him that Miss Manette had arrived from London and would be happy to see him . So soon ? Miss Manette had had some food and drink on the journey and didn't need anymore when she arrived . She was extremely anxious to see Mr . Lorry immediately , if he was ready to meet with her . 
 Mr . Lorry tossed back the rest of his wine with an air of calm desperation , straightened his odd little wig over his ears , and followed the waiter to Miss Manette's room . The room was large and dark , and it was furnished like a funeral parlor with black horsehair furniture and heavy , dark tables . These tables had been oiled repeatedly , so that the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room were gloomily reflected in the oiled surface . The reflections made it look like the candles themselves were buried deep in graves of black mahogany , and they would give off no light until they were dug out . 
 The room was so dark that , as Mr . Lorry carefully crossed the worn Turkish carpet , he thought for a moment that Miss Manette was in a different room . Then he moved past the two tall candles and saw a young lady standing to meet him between the table and the fire . She was no older than seventeen and wore a riding cloak . She was still holding her straw traveling hat by its ribbon . 
 He looked at her short , thin , pretty figure , her golden blonde hair , her curious blue eyes , and her young , smooth forehead , which had a habit of wrinkling up in an expression that looked like a mixture of confusion , wonder , fear , and keen awareness . As he looked at her , she suddenly reminded him of a child he had held in his arms on a journey across the Channel separating England and France , on a cold day when it was hailing heavily and the sea was high . 
 The similarity passed quickly , like steam breathed on the mirror behind her would pass quickly . On the frame of that mirror behind her , figurines of black cupids , broken and headless , held out baskets of fruit to black goddesses . Mr . Lorry bowed formally to Miss Manette . 
 Please , sit down , sir , she said , in a very clear and pleasant young voice with a very slight foreign accent . I kiss your hand , miss , said Mr . Lorry , in a slightly old-fashioned manner , as he bowed formally again and sat down . I received a letter from the bank , sir , yesterday , telling me about some informationor discovery . The word isn't important , miss , either one will do . regarding what little property my poor father owned . I never met him . He has been dead so long.
 Mr . Lorry moved in his seat and looked uneasily at the line of black cupids , as if they could help anyone ! making it necessary that I travel to Paris to meet with a gentleman from the bank , who would be sent there to meet with me . That's me . That's what I thought , sir . She curtseyed to him (young ladies curtsied in those days) to acknowledge how much older and wiser he was than her . He bowed to her again . 
 I replied to the bank , sir . I told them that since I am an orphan with no friends who could go with me , I would be grateful if the gentleman from the bank could travel with me for protection . The gentleman had already left London , but I believe a messenger was sent after him to ask him to wait for me here . 
 I was happy to be given the job , said Mr . Lorry . I will be even happier to perform it . Thank you , sir . I am very grateful . The bank told me that you would explain the details of the situation to me , and that I should prepare myself to be surprised by what I hear . I have prepared myself as best I can . Naturally , I am anxious to know what this is all about . 
 Of course , said Mr . Lorry . After a pause , he adjusted his blond wig around his ears and added , It is very difficult to begin . He did not begin , and unable to decide how to proceed , looked her in the eye . Her forehead wrinkled into that unique , though attractive , expression . She raised her hand impulsively , as if trying to catch a passing shadow . 
 Have we ever met before , sir ? Would we have ? Mr . Lorry opened his hands and extended them toward her with an awkward smile . Between her eyebrows and just above her dainty little nose , which was as fine and delicate as possible , her expression deepened . She sat down thoughtfully in the chair next to which she had been standing . He watched her as she thought , and as soon as she looked up again , he continued : 
 In England , where you now live , I suppose I should speak to you the way I would speak to any young English lady . Yes , Miss Manette ? If you please , sir . Miss Manette , I am a businessman . I have a job to do . As you listen to me , don't pay any more attention to me than as if I were just a robotreally , I am not much more than that . With your permission , miss , I will tell you a story about one of my bank's customers . 
 Story ? He seemed to purposefully mistake the word she had repeated when he added quickly , Yes , customers . In the bank business we usually call our clients customers . The customer I will tell you about was a French gentleman , a talented man of sciencea doctor . Not from Beauvais ? Why , yes , from Beauvais . 
 Like your father , Monsieur Manette , this gentleman was from Beauvais . And , like your father , this gentleman was well-known in Paris . I had the honor of knowing him there . Our dealings were about business , but private . At that time I had been working at our branch in France for , oh , twenty years . May I ask , what time this was , sir ? 
 I'm talking about twenty years ago , miss . He married an English lady and I was one of the trustees of their affairs . His affairs , like the affairs of many French gentlemen and their families , were entirely in the hands of Tellson's . In a similar way , I am , or have been , a trustee of sorts for many of our customers . These relationships are entirely business , miss . They are not friendships . I have moved from one to the next over the course of my work , just as I pass from one customer to the next during my work day . In other words , I have no feelings toward these people . I am only a machine . To continue
 This sounds like my father's story , sirshe looked at him intenselyand I'm starting to think that when my mother died only two years after my father did , and I became an orphan , you were the one that brought me to England . I am almost sure it was you . Mr . Lorry took her hesitating little hand that reached forward to take his , and raised it to his lips . He then brought the young woman immediately to her chair again . Holding the back of the chair with his left hand , and using his right to rub his chin , adjust his wig , and emphasize what he said , he stood looking down into her face as she sat looking up at his . 
 Miss Manette , it was me . And you will see how I was telling the truth when I said I have no personal feelings , and the relationships I have are all professional . This is why I haven't seen you since then . No , you have been a ward of Tellson's Bank since then , and I have been busy with the bank's other business . I have no time for feelings . I spend all of my time working for the great financial machine . 
 After this strange description of his work life , Mr . Lorry flattened his blond wig on his head with both hands (which was really unnecessary , since it was already as flat as could be) and continued . So far , miss , as you have said , this is the story you have heard about your poor father . This next part is different , though . If your father had not died when he didDon't be afraid ! What a reaction ! 
 She had jumped and had grabbed his wrist with both her hands . Please , said Mr . Lorry soothingly . He took his left hand off the back of the chair and placed it on her fingers , which clasped on him in a violent tremble : Please control yourself . It's a business matter . As I was saying She looked so upset that he lost track of what he was saying , and started over : 
 As I was saying , what if Monsieur Manette had not died ? What if he had suddenly and silently disappeared ? What if he had been taken away ? It would be easy to guess what kind of place he was taken to , but what if no one could find him ? What if he had had an enemy in France who had such power that even the bravest people were afraid to whisper about him ? The power , for instance , to send anyone to prison for any length of time . What if his wife had begged the king , the queen , the members of the court , and the church for any news about him , but with no success ? If this were true , then your father's story would be the same as that of the poor doctor from Beauvais . 
 I beg you to tell me more , sir . I will . I am going to . Can you handle it ? I can handle anything but the uncertainty you're causing me right now . You speak calmly , and you are calm . That's good ! said Mr . Lorry , though his words were more convincing than his behavior . Think of it as a business matter , a job that must be done . Now if this doctor's wife , although she was a brave woman , had suffered so much before her little child was born
 The little child was a daughter , sir . Yes , a daughter . Remember , this is a business matterdon't be upset . Perhaps , the poor woman had suffered so much before her little child was born that she decided to spare the poor child the same pain by raising her to believe that her father was dead . Miss Manette kneeled down in front of him . No , don't kneel down ! In the name of Heaven , why should you kneel down to me ! For telling me the truth . Oh good , kind sir , for telling me the truth ! 
 Ait's a business matter . You're confusing me , and how can I do my job if I'm confused ? Let's be clear-headed . Please tell me now , for instance , how much nine times nine pence is , or how many shillings are in twenty guineas . That would make me feel better about your state of mind . She didn't answer him . But she remained so still after he sat her up in her chair , and her hands , as they held his wrists , were so much steadier than before , that she communicated calmness to Mr . Jarvis Lorry . 
 That's right , that's right . Be brave ! This is business ! You have business in front of you , important business . Miss Manette , this is how your mother decided to handle things . She never gave up her search for your father , though she was unsuccessful . When she diedI believe broken-heartedshe left you at two years old to grow up beautiful and happy . She didn't want you wondering whether your father died soon after going to prison , or if he wasted away over the course of many years . 
 As he spoke , he looked down with admiration and pity on her flowing golden hair , and he imagined that it might already be streaked with gray . You know that your parents didn't have much , and what they did have was given to you and your mother . No new money or any other property has been discovered . 
 He felt her grab his wrist tighter and stopped speaking . The expression on her forehead , which had so much attracted his attention , had deepened into one of pain and horror . But he has beenbeen found . He is alive . He has probably changed a lot . He might be a broken man , though we will hope for the best . Still , he's alive . Your father has been taken to the house of one of his former servants in Paris , and we are going there . I go to identify him , if I can . You go to bring him back to life . To take bring him love , duty , rest , and comfort . 
 A shiver ran through her body and his . She said , in a low , clear , awe-struck voice , as if she were in a dream : I am going to see his ghost ! It will be his ghost , not him ! Mr . Lorry quietly rubbed her hands , which held his arm . There now , there now ! You know the best and the worst of it now . You are well on your way to seeing the poor mistreated gentleman . If the journey goes well , you will soon be with him . She repeated in the same tone , as low as a whisper , I have been free , I have been happy , but his ghost has never haunted me ! 
 One more thing , said Mr . Lorry , emphasizing the words to get her attention . He was discovered under another name , his own name being either long forgotten or hidden . It wouldn't do any good to ask which was the case , or to ask if he'd been held prisoner so long by mistake or on purpose . It's best not to ask around about it because it would be dangerous . Better not to mention it , and to get him out of France , at least for a while . 
 Even I , who am safe because I am an Englishman , and even Tellson's Bank , as important as it is to the credit of the French government , need to stay out of the matter . I carry nothing in writing that directly refers to this matter . This is an entirely secret operation . All information pertaining to the matter is contained in the one line ëBrought back to life , ' which could mean anything . But what's the matter ? She doesn't hear a word ! Miss Manette ! 
 She sat completely still and silent in her chair , completely shocked . Her eyes were open and focused on him , and she still had that expression on her forehead , as if it had been carved or branded there . She was holding onto his arm so tightly that he was afraid that if he took it away he would hurt her . He stayed still and yelled out for help . 
 A wild-looking woman came running into the room ahead of some of the hotel staff . Even in his agitation , Mr . Lorry noticed she was all in red , with red hair , and wore a bizarre , tight-fitting outfit and a bonnet that looked like a soldier's hat , or a large wooden spoon , or a block of cheese . The woman detached him from Miss Manette's grip by laying a brawny hand on Mr . Lorry's chest and throwing him against the nearest wall . 
 (I think she's actually a man ! Mr . Lorry thought as he hit the wall . )Why , look at you all ! the woman yelled at the inn servants . Why don't you go get some things to help her instead of standing there staring at me ? I am not that pretty , am I ? Why don't you go get some things to help her . I'll teach you a lesson if you don't bring me smelling salts , cold water , and vinegar quickly ! 
 The servants immediately ran off , and the woman softly laid Miss Manette on a sofa . She attended to her with great skill and gentleness , calling her my precious ! and my bird ! and spreading her blonde hair out over her shoulders with great pride and care . And you in the brown ! she said , turning angrily to Mr . Lorry . Couldn't you say what you needed to say without frightening her to death ? Look at her , with her pretty pale face and her cold hands . Do you call that being a banker ? ! 
 Mr . Lorry was so unsettled by the tricky question that he could only look on from a distance with pathetic sympathy and humility . Meanwhile , the strong woman , having sent away the servants with the vague threat that she would teach them a lesson , which she didn't specify , slowly brought Miss Manette back to consciousness and placed the young lady's drooping head on her shoulder . 
 I hope she'll feel better now , said Mr . Lorry . No thanks to you in the bown , if she does , the woman responded . My pretty darling ! I hope you will accompany Miss Manette to France , said Mr . Lorry after another pause of pathetic sympathy and humility . Not very likely ! replied the strong woman . If I was supposed to travel overseas , do you suppose Fate would have put me on an island ? 
 This was another tricky question , and Mr . Jarvis Lorry went away to think about it . A large wine cask had been dropped and lay broken in the street . The accident happened while people were taking it out of a cart . The cask had rolled out quickly , its hoops burst , and it now lay on the stones just outside the door of the wine-shop , shattered like a walnut-shell . 
 Everyone nearby had stopped what they were doing and ran to drink the spilled wine . The street's cobblestones were oddly shaped and stuck out in all directions , as if they were made just to injure those who walked on them . The stones divided the spilled wine into little puddles , and a crowd proportional to each puddle's size surrounded each one . 
 Some men kneeled down and made scoops with their hands , and sipped . Or they tried to give sips to the women bending over them before the wine ran out between their fingers . Other men and women dipped old clay mugs into the puddles , or even soaked the wine up with women's headscarves then squeezed it into their babies' mouths . Others piled up mounds of mud to stop the flow of wine . Others , directed by people watching from the windows above , ran around trying to stop the little streams . Others concentrated on the red pieces of the cask , licking or chewing the wine-soaked wood eagerly .
 The sounds of laughter and amused voices , coming from men , women , and children , sounded in the street while the people drank up the wine . There was a little roughness to the event , and a lot of playfulness . There was a special camaraderie in it , an urge in everyone to join in with someone else . This led , especially among the light-hearted ones , to playful hugs , toasts , and handshakes , and even to as many as a dozen people joining hands and dancing . 
 The man who had left his saw stuck in the firewood he was cutting went back to work . The women returned to their door-steps where they had left little pots of hot ashes , in which they tried to ease the pain in their own hungry fingers and toes or in those of their children . Sleeveless men with dirty , matted hair and thin faces who had crept out of cellars into the daylight went back inside . The mood on the street returned to its natural gloom . 
 The red wine had stained the ground where it spilled on the narrow street , in the Paris suburb of Saint Antoine . It had stained many hands , faces , bare feet , and wooden shoes , too . The hands of the man who sawed wood left red marks on the logs . The forehead of the woman who nursed her baby was stained from the old rag she wrapped around her head again . Those who had greedily chewed on pieces of the cask now had a tiger-like smear across their mouths . One tall prankster wearing a long , filthy nightcap dipped his finger in the mixture of mud and wine and wrote the word blood on a wall . 
 The gloomy mood that had disappeared briefly from Saint Antoine now returned . Cold , dirt , sickness , lack of education , and poverty caused the darkness of that mood . All were serious problems , especially poverty . A few people , who had been worn down as if in a mill , and not a magical mill that makes old people young , shivered at every corner . They passed in and out at every doorway , looked from every window , fluttered in their ragged clothing , which the wind shook . 
 The mill had ground them down , making the young people seem old . The children had very old faces and harsh voices , and hunger was on every face , young and old . It was everywhere . The wrinkles of their aged faces and every breath they took suggested hunger . The tall houses and the tattered clothes that hung on the poles and clotheslines suggested hunger . The clothes sewn together from straw and rags and wood and paper suggested hunger . 
 The small bits of firewood the man was sawing , and the chimneys that had no smoke coming out of them suggested hunger . The filthy streets covered in trash but not a bit of food suggested hunger . The baker's shelves and every tiny loaf of his small supply of bad bread suggested hunger . The sausage shop , where they sold sausages made from dead dogs , suggested hunger . The rattling of chestnuts in a roaster , and the bits of potatoes , fried with just a few drops of oil , suggested hunger . 
 For the time would come when the gaunt , jobless , and hungry citizens who watched the lamplighter for so long would think up a better way to do his job . They would hang men by those ropes and pulleys , instead of lamps , revealing their inner darkness . But that time had not yet come . Instead , everyone ignored the warning signs that revolution might be on its way . 
 The wine shop was on a corner . It was nicer than most other shops , and the owner stood outside wearing a yellow jacket and green pants , watching people fight for the spilled wine . It's not my problem , he said , shrugging his shoulders . It's the market people's fault . Let them bring me another cask . Then he saw the tall prankster writing on the wall . He yelled to the man across the street . 
 Hey , Gaspard ! What are you doing over there ? The man pointed proudly to the word he had written , as pranksters often do . The joke failed , as pranksters' jokes often do as well . What are you doing ? Are you crazy ? said the owner of the wine shop , crossing the road and covering the word with a handful of mud . Why are you writing this in public ? Tell me , is there no other place you can write such words ? 
 While he was talking , he placed his clean hand (possibly by accident , possibly not) over the prankster's heart . The prankster tapped it with his own hand , jumped up quickly , and landed in a strange dancing pose , holding one of his stained shoe in his hand threateningly . The prankster was a resourceful man . 
 Put your shoe back on , said the wine shop owner . Go get some wine and leave that alone . He wiped his dirty hand on the prankster's dirty clothes , since the prankster was the reason he had gotten his hand dirty in the first place . Then he went back to the wine shop . The wine shop owner was a stocky , military-looking thirty-year-old man . He must have had a hot temper , since he wore no coat even though it was bitterly cold , though he carried a coat slung over his shoulder . 
 His sleeves were rolled up and his tan arms were bare to his elbows . He wore no hat either , just his short , curly , dark hair . He had a dark complexion , and his good eyes were spaced far apart . He was a pleasant-looking man overall , but stubborn-looking , too . He was a decisive man of strong principles . You wouldn't want to see him charging toward you on a narrow bridge , because nothing would stop him . 
 Madame Defarge , his wife , was sitting behind the shop counter when he came in . She was a large woman about the same age as he was , with alert eyes that rarely seemed to look directly at anything . She had large hands with many rings on them , a calm face , strong features , and had great self-control . There was something about her that made you think that she rarely made mistakes . Madame Defarge , being sensitive to the cold , was wrapped up in fur . She had a large , brightly colored shawl wrapped around her head , though it didn't hide her large earrings . 
 Her knitting was in front of her , where she had laid it down to pick her teeth with a toothpick . She sat picking her teeth with her right elbow supported by her left hand , and didn't say anything when her husband came in . She cleared her throat and raised her eyebrows slightly , indicating to her husband that he should look around the shop for any new customers that had arrived while he was across the street . 
 He looked around and saw an old gentleman and a young woman sitting in the corner . Other people were in the shop too : two were playing cards , two were playing dominoes , and three were standing by the counter trying to make the most of a small amount of wine . As he stepped behind the counter , he noticed the old gentleman give a look to the young woman as if to say , This is the man we're looking for . 
 What the devil are you doing here ? Monsieur Defarge thought . I don't know you . He pretended not to notice the two strangers and went to talk with the three customers drinking at the counter . How's it going , Jacques ? said one of the three to Monsieur Defarge . Has all the spilled wine been drunk ? Every drop , Jacques , answered Monsieur Defarge . 
 After this greeting by first names , Madame Defarge , while picking her teeth with her toothpick , cleared her throat again and raised her eyebrows a bit higher . It is not often , the second man said to Monsieur Defarge , that these pathetic creatures get to taste wine , or anything besides black bread and death . Don't you agree , Jacques ? 
 That's true , Jacques , Monsieur Defarge returned . After this second exchange of first names , Madame Defarge , still calmly picking her teeth , cleared her throat again and raised her eyebrows a bit higher . The third man now set down his empty cup , smacked his lips , and said : Ah ! That's even worse ! These poor animals always have a sour taste in their mouths , and their lives are hard , Jacques . Am I right , Jacques ? 
 You are right , Jacques , answered Monsieur Defarge . They completed this third exchange of first names just as Madame Defarge put down her toothpick and shifted slightly in her seat , with her eyebrows still up . Hold up . Wait , muttered Monsieur Defarge . Gentlemen , this is my wife ! The three customers took off their hats and gestured grandly to Madame Defarge . She acknowledged their respect by bowing her head and giving them a quick look . Then she looked casually around the wine shop and calmly went back to her knitting . 
 Good day , gentlemen , said her husband , who had been watching her carefully . The apartment you had asked about while I was out is on the fifth floor . The doorway of the staircase opens out onto a little courtyard close to the left here , near the window of my shop , he said , pointing with his hand . But now I remember that one of you has been there before and can lead way . Goodbye , gentlemen ! 
 They paid for the wine and left . Monsieur Defarge was watching his wife knit when the old gentleman came over and asked to speak with him . Of course , sir , Monsieur Defarge said and walked quietly with him to the door . Their conversation was short but to the point . Almost at the first word , Monsieur Defarge jumped to attention . Moments later , he nodded and went out . The gentleman motioned to the young lady , and they also went out . Madame Defarge kept knitting and pretended not to notice . 
 Mr . Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette came out of the wine shop and joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway he had just directed the three customers to . It opened onto a dark , stinking little courtyard that served as the public entrance to many houses , where a great number of people lived . In the gloomy tiled entry to the gloomy tiled staircase , Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee in front of the child of his old master and kissed her hand . Though the gesture was kind , he didn't do it kindly . In just a few seconds , he had changed . His face was no longer pleasant or friendly , but had become secretive , angry , and dangerous . 
 It is very high up , and a little difficult to get to . It's best to start slowly , Monsieur Defarge said in a stern voice to Mr . Lorry as they began to climb the stairs . Is he alone ? Mr . Lorry whispered . Alone ? God help him , who would be with him ! said Monsieur Defarge , in the same quiet voice . Is he always alone ? Yes . By his own choice ? He needs to be . He's been the same since I first saw himsince they found me and asked if I would take care of him in secret . 
 Has he changed much ? Changed ! Monsieur Defarge stopped to hit the wall with his hand , and he cursed . No direct answer could have been half as effective . Mr . Lorry's mood grew grimmer as he and the two others climbed the stairs . An old staircase like this one , located in the older and more crowded parts of Paris , would be bad enough today 1859 today . But back then they were particularly disgusting , especially to people who weren't used to them . 
 Every little apartment in one of these large buildings that opened onto the public staircase dumped its garbage on the landing . Other refuse got thrown out the windows . This unmanageable and hopeless pile of rotting garbage would have polluted the air even if it had not been the garbage of the poor , but the combination of trash and poverty made the smell almost unbearable . The three people walked through all this filth and up a steep , dark , dirty stairwell . 
 Giving in to his own troubled thoughts and to Miss Manette's anxiety , which became greater every moment , Mr . Jarvis Lorry stopped twice to rest . Each stop was made near a miserable air vent , through which any clean air that was left seemed to escape , and through which rotten air seemed to enter . Through the air vents you could taste , rather than see , parts of the neighborhood . Nothing nearby , from that spot to the great towers of Notre Dame , showed any signs of good health or good thoughts . 
 At last they reached the top of the staircase , and they stopped for the third time . They still needed to climb a steeper , narrower upper staircase to reach the attic . The owner of the wine shop walked a little ahead of them and always stayed next to Mr . Lorry , as though afraid the young lady might ask him a question . He turned around and carefully removed a key from the pocket of the coat he carried over his shoulder . 
 Then the door is locked , my friend ? asked Mr . Lorry , surprised . Oh , yes , Monsieur Defarge answered seriously . You think it's necessary to keep the poor gentleman locked up ? I think it's necessary to turn the key , Monsieur Defarge whispered in his ear , and frowned heavily . Why ? Why ! Because he has been locked up for so long that he would be afraid , go mad , tear himself apart , die , or some other terrible thing if his door were left open . 
 Is that possible ? exclaimed Mr . Lorry . Is that possible ! repeated Defarge , bitterly . Yes , and what a wonderful world we live in when such a thing is possible , and not only possible , but happensactually happens ! every day . Long live the devil . Let's keep going . They spoke too quietly for the young woman to hear , but by now fear and anxiety shook her so much that Mr . Lorry felt he should reassure her . 
 Be brave , miss ! Courage ! This is business ! The worst part will be over in a moment . It's just walking into a room , and the worst is over . Then , all the goodness , all the relief , all the happiness you'll bring him will begin . Let our good friend here help you . Our good friend Monsieur Defarge . Come , now . Business , business ! 
 They went up slowly and quietly . The staircase was short , and they were soon at the top . As they rounded a sharp turn in the staircase , they suddenly saw three men . Their heads were bent down close together at the side of the door , and they were intently looking into the room through some cracks in the wall . When they heard footsteps approach , the three men turned and stood up . They were the three men named Jacques who had been drinking in the wine shop . 
 I forgot about them when your visit surprised me , explained Monsieur Defarge . Go away , my friends ; we have business here . The three men slipped past and went silently downstairs . Since there didn't appear to be any other doors on that floor , and the wine-shop owner went straight to this one when they were alone , Mr . Lorry asked him in a whisper , a little angry : Are you making a spectacle of Monsieur Manette ? 
 I show him , in the way you just saw , to a select few . Is that proper ? I think it's proper . Who are the few ? How do you select them ? I select true men . Men with my name , Jacques , who would benefit from seeing him . I won't say anymore . You are English . You wouldn't understand . Please wait there for a moment . He motioned for them to stay back , then leaned over and looked in through the crack in the wall . Soon he raised his head and knocked two or three times on the doorapparently just to make noise . 
 For this same reason , he dragged the key across the door three or four times before clumsily putting it in the lock and loudly turning it . He slowly opened the door slowly , looked into the room , and said something . A quiet voice answered back . Neither person spoke much more than a syllable . Defarge looked back over his shoulder and motioned for them to enter . Mr . Lorry felt Miss Manette sink so he put his arm around her waist . 
 A-a-a-business , business ! he said , with a tear on his cheek that had nothing to do with business . Come in ! I'm afraid of it , she answered , trembling . Of ëit' ? Of what ? I mean of him . Of my father . Concerned by the state she was in and by the gesturing of Monsieur Defarge , Mr . Lorry pulled her arm around his neck , lifted her slightly , and rushed her into the room . He sat her down just inside the door and held her as she clung to him . 
 Defarge took out the key , closed the door , and locked it from the inside . Then he took the key and held it in his hand . He did all of this methodically , making as much noise as he could . Finally he crossed the room to the window , where he stopped and turned around . The attic had been built to be a storage room for firewood and other things . It was dim and dark . The window was actually a door in the roof , with a small pulley over it for lifting things from the street . There were no windowpanes , and it had two pieces that met in the middle to close it , like any other French door . 
 To keep out the cold , one half of the door was closed tight , and the other was opened very slightly . Such a small amount of light came through that it was hard to see anything when one first entered the room . It would have taken a long time to adjust to the darkness enough to be able to do any kind of detailed work there . Yet , that kind of work was being done in the attic . With his back to the door and his face toward the window where Monsieur Defarge stood looking at him , a white-haired man sat on a short bench , bent over and very busy , making shoes . 
 Good day ! said Monsieur Defarge to the white-haired man , who was bent over making shoes . The man looked up for a moment and answered quietly , as if he were far away : Good day ! You are still hard at work , I see ? After a long pause , the man looked up and answered . Yes , I am working . This time the man raised his haggard eyes up to him before looking down again . 
 His voice was so quiet it was pitiful and dreadful . It wasn't quiet because the man was physically weak , although being locked up and treated badly had done their part . His voice was quiet because he had been kept alone and hadn't used it . It was like the last feeble echo of a sound made a long , long time ago . It had lost so much of its liveliness and sound that it was like a beautiful color that has faded away to a faint stain . It was so low that it sounded like it was coming from underground . It was so sad and hopeless that it would have reminded a starving traveler , exhausted by wandering in the wilderness , of his home and friends just before he lied down to die . 
 The man worked silently for a few minutes . His tired eyes looked up again , not with any interest or curiosity , but mechanically , and he noticed that Monsieur Defarge had not yet left . I want to let a little more light in here , said Defarge , who was still staring at the shoemaker . Can you handle a little more light ? Monsieur Manette stopped working . He looked down at the floor beside him with a vacant air of listening , then at the floor on the other side of him , then up at Monsieur Defarge . 
 What did you say ? Can you stand a little more light ? I must stand it , if you let more in , he said , slightly stressing the word must . Defarge propped the half door open a little more . A broad shaft of light came into the attic and revealed the shoemaker with an unfinished shoe in his lap as he paused his work . A few basic tools and some leather scraps were around him at his feet and on the bench . He had a white , ragged beard that wasn't very long , a thin face , and very bright eyes . 
 The emptiness and thinness of his face would ordinarily have made his eyes look large under his dark eyebrows and tangled white hair . But they were naturally large , so now they looked unnaturally big . His yellow , tattered shirt was open at the throat , showing that his body was skinny and worn out . The old man , his old coat , his baggy stockings , and his tattered clothes had all been away from light and air for so long that they had turned a single shade of yellow , making it hard to distinguish one from the other . 
 He raised his hand to shield his eyes from the light , and even the bones of it seemed transparent . He had stopped working and sat there with a steady , empty look . He never looked at the man in front of him without first looking down on this side of himself , then on the other , as if he had forgotten how to tell where sound was coming from . He never said anything without doing this first , then forgetting to speak . 
 Are you going to finish that pair of shoes today ? asked Defarge , motioning to Mr . Lorry to come forward . What did you say ? Do you plan on finishing that pair of shoes today ? I can't say that I plan to . I guess so . I don't know . The question reminded him of his work , and he bent over the shoes and started working again . Mr . Lorry moved forward silently , leaving Miss Manette by the door . After he had stood next to Defarge for a minute or two , the shoemaker looked up . He didn't seem surprised to see another person , but the shaky fingers on one of his hands moved to his lips as he looked at him . (His lips and nails were both the same pale lead color . 
 Then he dropped his hand back to the shoes and started working again . This look and action happened in an instant . You have a visitor , you see , said Monsieur Defarge . What did you say ? There is a visitor here to see you . The shoemaker looked up as he had before , but without taking his hand off the shoes . Come ! said Defarge . Here is a man who knows a well-made shoe when he sees one . Show him that shoe you're working on . Take it , monsieur . Mr . Lorry took the shoe in his hand . 
 Tell this man what kind of shoe it is and who made it . There was a longer pause than usual before the shoemaker answered : I forget what you asked me . What did you say ? I said , won't you describe to this man what kind of shoe it is ? It is a lady's shoe . It is a young lady's walking shoe . It's in the latest style . I've never seen the style , but I've had a pattern to work from . He looked at the shoe with a slight hint of pride . 
 And who made it ? asked Defarge . Now that he didn't have the shoes to hold onto , he kept wringing his hands and stroking his beard . Every time he finished speaking , the man's mind would wander off again . Trying to keep his attention was like trying to revive a person who had fainted , or like trying to keep a dying man alive to get information from him . 
 Did you ask me what my name was ? Yes , I did . My name is One Hundred and Five , North Tower . Is that it ? One Hundred and Five , North Tower . With a weary sound that wasn't a sigh or a groan he resumed working , until the silence was broken again . You're not a professional shoemaker , are you ? asked Mr . Lorry , staring at him . The man looked wearily at Defarge as if he wanted him to answer the question for him . When Defarge didn't respond , the man looked at the ground and then back at Mr . Lorry . 
 Am I professional shoemaker ? No , I was not a professional shoemaker . I-I learned how to make shoes here . I taught myself . I asked permission to . He stared off for a few minutes , wringing his hands the whole time . Slowly he looked back toward Mr . Lorry . When he looked at him he flinched and started up again as if he had just been woken up and was continuing a conversation from the night before . 
 I asked permission to teach myself , and after fighting with them a long time they let me . I have been making shoes ever since . He held out a hand for the shoe that Mr . Lorry was holding . Mr . Lorry was still staring at him . Monsieur Manette , don't you remember me ? asked Mr . Lorry . Monsieur Manette dropped the shoe and sat staring at Mr . Lorry . Mr . Lorry put his hand on Defarge's arm . Monsieur Manette , Mr . Lorry said , laying his hand upon Defarge's arm , don't you remember this man ? Look at him . Look at me . Do you not remember an old banker ? Some old business ? An old servant ? A time long ago , Monsieur Manette ? 
 His mind clouded over again . He looked at the two men with less and less understanding , and his eyes wandered back to the ground the way they had before . Finally , sighing deeply , he picked up the shoe and went back to work . Did you recognize him , monsieur ? whispered Defarge . Yes . For just a second . At first I thought it was hopeless . But I have definitely seen , for one moment , the face that I once knew very well . Quiet ! Let's move back a little . Quiet ! 
 Miss Manette had moved away from the attic wall and was very close to the bench he sat on . There was something terrible about the fact that he was unaware of someone so close she could have reached out and touched him . No one said a word . No one made a sound . She stood next to him like a ghost as he bent over his work . After a while he put down the tool in his hand to pick up his shoemaker's knife . It was on the side of the bench opposite where she stood . He had picked it up and was leaning over to start working again when he noticed the bottom of her dress . He looked up and saw her face . 
 He stared at her with a frightened look . After a while he started to form words with his lips , although he wasn't making any sound . Little by little , in between his quick , heavy breaths , he said : What is this ? With tears running down her face , she blew him a kiss with both hands . Then she placed her hands on her heart as if she were holding his head to it . You aren't the jailer's daughter ? No , she sighed . Who are you ? 
 Still afraid to speak , she sat down next to him on the bench . He pulled away , but she placed her hand on his arm . As she did , a strange excitement struck him , and passed through him visibly . He gently put down the knife and sat there staring at her . Her long , curly blond hair had been brushed aside and fell down over her neck . Moving his hand toward her little by little , he picked up her hair and looked at it . While doing this , his mind wandered again , and with another deep sigh , he went back to his shoemaking . 
 This didn't last long , though . Letting go of his arm , she placed her hand on his shoulder . He looked at it suspiciously two or three times , as if to make sure it was really there . Then he laid down his work , reached his hand up to his neck , and removed a black string with a folded scrap of rag tied to it . Carefully he unfolded it on his knee . Inside were one or two long golden hairs , which he had wrapped around his finger long ago . 
 He took her hair in his hand again and looked closely at it . It's the same . How can that be ! When ! How ! As the intense expression reappeared on his forehead , he seemed to realize that the same expression was on her forehead too . He moved her into the light and looked at her . The night I was taken away , she had put her head on my shoulder . She was afraid I was going away , though I wasn't . When they brought me to the North Tower they found these hairs on my sleeve . Will you leave them with me ? ' I asked . ëThey can't help me escape this place physically , though they may help me escape spiritually . Those were the words I said . I remember them very well . 
 He formed these words silently with his lips many times before he could say them out loud . When he did finally speak them , he said them clearly , though slowly . How did this happen ? WAS IT YOU ? Once again the two men jumped as the old man turned toward her suddenly . But she sat completely still there as he held onto her and only said quietly , Please , gentlemen , don't come near us . Don't speak . Don't move . 
 Listen ! Monsieur Manette cried . Whose voice was that ? He let go of her as he yelled this out and tore at his white hair in a frenzy . This fit died down , much like everything had died out of him over the years except for his interest in shoemaking . He folded up the rag and tried to tie it around his neck again . He was still looking at her and sadly shaking his head . 
 No , no , no . You are too young . Too full of life . It can't be you . These are not the hands she knew , this is not the face she knew , this is not a voice she ever heard . No , no . She was , and he was , before all those slow-moving years I spent in the North Toweryears ago . What is your name , my gentle angel ? Noticing that he had softened his tone of voice and behavior , his daughter fell down on her knees in front of him and placed her hands on his chest . 
 Oh , sir ! Some other time I will tell you my name , and who my mother was , and who my father was , and how I never knew their awful story . But I can't tell you right now , not here . All I can ask right now is that you touch me and give me your blessing . Kiss me , kiss me ! Oh my dear , my dear ! His cold white hair mixed with her shining blond hair , and it was as if her hair warmed his like the light of freedom shining on him . 
 If my voiceI don't know if it does , but if soif it reminds you of a voice that was once sweet music in your ears , cry for it ! If touching my hair reminds you of the head that once rested on your chest when you were young and free , cry for it ! If I hint that a home awaits you where I will take care of you , and it reminds you of the long-empty home you remembered from afar , cry for it ! She hugged him around the neck and rocked him back and forth like a child . 
 I tell you that your agony is over , and that I've come here to take you from it , and that we're going to England to be at peace . If that causes you to think of your wasted life , and how our home country , France , has mistreated you , cry for it ! When I tell you my name , and about my father who is living , and about my mother who is dead , if you find out that I must beg my father's forgiveness because I didn't stay awake crying all night since my mother never told me of his imprisonment , cry for it ! Cry for her , then , and for me ! Gentlemen , thank God ! 
 I feel God's tears on my face and his sobbing in my heart . Thank God ! He had fallen into her arms and rested his head on her chest . The two men were so moved by the sight , and by knowing all the injustice and suffering that had happened before it , that they covered their faces to hide their tears . When it had been quiet in the attic for a while and the old man had stopped shaking and gave in to the calm that follows any storm , the two men stepped forward . They lifted the man and his daughter up off the ground . He had slowly fallen to the floor and lay there exhausted . 
 She had settled down with him , keeping her arm under his head . Her hair was draped over his face and shielded him from the light . Miss Manette raised her hand to Mr . Lorry , as he stooped over them after repeatedly blowing his nose , and said , If we can do it without upsetting him , I would like to leave for Paris right away . But do you think he is fit to travel ? asked Mr . Lorry . 
 More fit to travel , I think , than to stay in this city , where he has been treated so terribly . It's true , said Defarge , who was kneeling nearby . More importantly , Monsieur Manette will be safer outside of France . Should I hire a carriage and horses ? That's a business matter , said Mr . Lorry , going back to his professional demeanor . And if business needs to be done , then I should be the one to do it . Then will you please leave us here ? asked Miss Manette . You see how calm he is now , and you can't be afraid to leave me here with him . Why should you be ? If you will lock the door so no one can bother us , I'm sure you will find him as calm when you return as he is now . 
 In any case , I'll take care of him until you get back , and then we will move him right away . Both Mr . Lorry and Defarge thought this was a bad idea and thought one of them should stay . But someone needed to find a carriage and horses and traveling papers . The day was almost over , and they were running out of time . The two men finally decided to divide up these tasks between them , and they hurried off to do them . 
 As it grew dark , the young woman lay her head down on the hard ground next to her father and watched him . It got darker and darker , and they both lay there quietly until a light shone through the cracks in the wall . Mr . Lorry and Monsieur Defarge had made all the arrangements for the journey . They had brought traveling cloaks and blankets , as well as bread and meat , wine , and hot coffee . Monsieur Defarge put these items , and the lamp he was carrying , on the shoemaker's bench (there was no other furniture in the attic except for a simple bed) . He and Mr . Lorry woke up the old man and helped him to his feet . 
 No one would have been able to tell from the blank , frightened look on his face what the man might have been thinking . No one would have been able to tell if he knew what had happened earlier , if he remembered what they had said to him , or if he knew that he was free . They tried speaking to him , but he was so confused and slow to answer that they worried he was incoherent and decided to leave him alone . He kept grabbing his head in his hands wildly in a way that he had not been doing before . Yet , he seemed pleased by the sound of his daughter's voice and would turn toward her when she spoke . 
 In the way of a man used to obeying orders , he ate and drank what they gave him , and put on the cloak and other clothes they gave him to wear . He happily let his daughter link arms with him and held her hand with both of his . They began to go downstairs , Monsieur Defarge going first with the lamp and Mr . Lorry coming last . They hadn't gone many steps down the long main staircase when the old man stopped and looked around at the roof and walls . 
 Do you remember this place , father ? Do you remember coming up here ? What did you say ? But before she could repeat the question , he mumbled an answer . Do I remember ? No , I don't remember . It was such a long time ago . It was clear that he had no memory of being brought from the prison to the house . They heard him mumble , One Hundred and Five , North Tower , and he looked around , apparently searching for the prison walls that had held him captive for so long . 
 When they reached the courtyard he instinctively changed his stride , as if he were expecting to come upon a drawbridge . When there was no drawbridge and he saw the carriage waiting in the street , he let go of his daughter's hand and grabbed his head again . No crowd was gathered around the door . No one could be seen at any of the many windows . No one even happened to be walking by on the street . Everything was strangely silent . Only one person could be seen , and that was Madame Defarge . She leaned against the doorframe , knitting and pretending to see nothing . 
 Monsieur Manette got into a coach and his daughter followed him . Mr . Lorry was about to get in when the old man asked pitifully for his shoemaking tools and unfinished shoes . Madame Defarge yelled to her husband that she would get them . Still knitting , she went out of the lamplight and through the courtyard . She brought them back quickly and passed them into the coach , and then she immediately went back to leaning against the doorframe , knitting and pretending to see nothing . Defarge climbed up on the coach and yelled , To the barrier ! The driver cracked his whip , and the coach drove off under the dim swinging streetlamps . 
 They drove through the streets under the swinging streetlamps , which were brighter in the richer neighborhoods and dimmer in the poorer ones . They passed well-lit shops and coffee houses , festive crowds , and theaters , until they arrived at one of the city gates . There they came upon some soldiers with lanterns at a guardhouse . Give us your papers , travelers ! See here then , Monsieur Officer , said Defarge , getting down from the coach and taking the soldier aside . These papers belong to the white-haired man inside . They were put in my care , along with the man , at the He lowered his voice . There was some movement among the soldiers' lanterns , and one of the soldiers shined his lantern inside the coach . The soldier looked carefully at the white-haired old man . 
 Beneath the starssome so far from earth that experts tell us their light may not have even reached us yetthe shadows of the night were large and black . All through the cold and restless night they whispered in the ears of Mr . Jarvis Lorry , as he sat across from the man who had been buried and then dug out . He wondered how much of Monsieur Manette's senses had been lost forever , and how much of them he could get back . The shadows whispered the same question as before :  
 Tellson's Bank near Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place , even back in 1780 . It was very small , very dark , very ugly , and very uncomfortable . The partners who ran the bank were old-fashioned too . They were proud of its smallness , darkness , ugliness , and discomfort . They even boasted that their bank was all these things , and they believed that it if hadn't been so unpleasant , it wouldn't have been so well respected . The bankers liked to brag about this to their competitors . 
 The old men who worked in the cramped quarters of Tellson's Bank took their work seriously . When the bank hired a young man , they hid him away until he was old . When they hired a young man at Tellson's London office , they kept him in a dark place and aged him , like a cheese , until he had the Tellson-flavor and mold grew on him . Only then was he allowed to be seen there , studying large books and strutting around with an air of self-importance . 
 Outside of the bank was a man who did odd jobs and sometimes acted as a porter or messenger . He never came inside , unless he was called in for a particular purpose . This man was like a living shop sign for the bank . He was always there during business hours unless he was out on an errand . If he was away , his son , a dirty twelve-year-old scamp who looked just like his father , took his place . People knew that the bank put up with this man . The bank always had someone working in this position , and through time and fate , this man had ended up with the job . His last name was Cruncher , and when he was baptized in the easterly parish church of Houndsditch , he had been given the first name of Jerry . 
 It was seven-thirty on a windy March morning in Mr . Cruncher's apartment in Hanging Sword Alley , Whitefriars . The year was Anno Domini The Year of Our Lord Anno Domini 1780 . (Mr . Cruncher always called it Anna Dominoes . Apparently he thought the year of our Lord started the year the game of dominoes was invented by a woman named Anna . )
 Mr . Cruncher's apartment was not in a very good neighborhood . It had only two rooms , and only if a closet with a tiny window counted as one of them . He kept his apartment clean , though . As early as it was this windy March morning , his bedroom was already scrubbed clean , and the cups and saucers were set out for breakfast on a clean white tablecloth . 
 Mr . Cruncher was asleep under a patchwork quilt , like a Harlequin a clown from Italian comedy that wore a costume made up of multicolored patches Harlequin at home . He was sleeping heavily , but little by little he began to toss and turn in bed , with his spiky hair looking like it would tear his sheets to shreds . Finally he sat up and yelled out in frustration : 
 Bust me , if she isn't at it again ! A neatly dressed woman quickly got up off her knees in the corner , with enough speed and fear to show that she was the woman he referred to . What ! said Mr . Cruncher , looking around the bed for his boot . You're at it again , are you ? After shouting at her a second time , her threw his boot at her . His boot was covered in mud , and that mud said a lot about Mr . Cruncher's other ways of making money . While he usually came home after banking hours with clean boots , he often went out again at night , and when he woke up the next morning his boots would be covered with clay . 
 What , said Mr . Cruncher , after he missed her with the boot . What are you up to , you aggravator ? I was only praying . Praying ! You're a nice woman ! What are you doing throwing yourself down on your knees and praying against me ? I'm not praying against you . I was praying for you . No , you weren't . And if you were , I won't be made a fool of . Cruncher then spoke to their son . Your mother's a nice woman , Young Jerry , he said sarcastically , praying that your father will fail . You've got a devoted mother , very religious , kneeling down and praying that the food will be taken away from her only child . 
 Mr . Cruncher's son , who hadn't gotten dressed yet , turned away from his mother . He did not like the fact that his mother was praying that his food be taken away . And how important do you think your prayers are , you arrogant woman ? asked Mr . Cruncher . How much do you think they're worth ? They come from the heart , Jerry . They're only worth what they mean to me . 
 Muttering other phrases like Oh , yes ! You're a religious woman , aren't you ? You would never go against the best interests of your husband and child , would you ? Not you ! and making other such sarcastic comments , Mr . Cruncher went about cleaning his boots and getting ready for work . Meanwhile , his son , whose hair was slightly less spiked than his father's and whose eyes were close together like his father's , watched his mother as he had been told . He kept surprising her by jumping out of his little bedroom where he was washing up and yelling , You were about to kneel down and pray , Mother . Hey ! Father ! and then , after yelling out this false warning , jumping back into the other room again with a grin . 
 Mr . Cruncher was still in a bad mood when he came to eat breakfast . He was particularly angry when Mrs . Cruncher said grace . What are you up to now , aggravator ! Are you at it again ? His wife explained to him that she was only asking for a blessing . Don't do it ! said Mr . Cruncher while he looked around , as if he expected his wife's prayers to make the loaf of bread on the table disappear . I'm not going to let myself be blessed out of house and home . I won't let you bless my food right off of my table . Keep quiet ! 
 Blurry-eyed and sullen , as if he had been up all night at a party that had ended badly , Jerry Cruncher ate his breakfast anxiously , growling over it like an animal . Around nine o'clock he calmed himself down and , making himself as respectable and professional looking as he could , went out to start his day . 
 You could barely call his work skilled labor , even though he liked to describe himself as an honest businessman . His only equipment was a wooden stool made from a broken chair . His son , young Jerry , carried the stool every morning as he walked at his father's side and placed it under the bank window closest to Temple Bar . He would take a handful of straw from the first vehicle that passed and use it to keep his feet warm and dry , and that was where Mr . Cruncher worked . Here at his position , Mr . Cruncher was as familiar to the people in Fleet Street and the Temple Bar area as Temple Bar itself . 
 Jerry took up his position there at 8 : 45 this windy March morning , just in time to tip his three-cornered hat to the oldest clerks of Tellson's Bank as they came into work . His son stood next to him when he wasn't wandering through Temple Bar looking for boys who were smaller than himself to pick on . Jerry and young Jerry , looking very much like each other , silently watched the morning traffic on Fleet Street . Their heads were as close together as each one's eyes were , making them look like a pair of monkeys . 
 One of the regular messengers that worked in the bank poked his head out the door and said : We need a porter ! Hooray , Father ! Here's an early job to start the day with ! Having sent his father off , young Jerry sat on the stool , looked at the straw his father had been chewing on , and thought . My father's fingers are always so rusty ! mumbled young Jerry . Where does he get all that iron rust on him ? He doesn't get any iron rust on him working here at the bank ! 
 You know the Old Bailey street in London where criminals were tried and imprisoned Old Bailey , don't you ? one of the bank's oldest clerks asked Jerry . Ye-es , sir , answered Jerry , warily . I do know the Old Bailey . I thought so . And you know Mr . Lorry . I know Mr . Lorry much better than I know or ever wish to know the Old Bailey . I'm an honest businessman . He answered as if he were a reluctant witness standing trial . Good . Go find the door where they bring the witnesses in , and show the doorman this note for Mr . Lorry . He will let you in . 
 Into the courtroom , sir ? Yes . Into the courtroom . Mr . Cruncher narrowed his eyes , as if his eyes were asking each other , What do you think about this ?  Should I wait for him in court , sir ? Mr . Cruncher asked . I'll tell you . The doorman will pass your note to Mr . Lorry . Get Mr . Lorry's attention and let him know that you're there . Then wait there until he needs you . 
 Is that all , sir ? That's all . He wants a messenger nearby . Your job is to let him know that you're there if he needs you . The elderly clerk folded and addressed the note . Mr . Cruncher watched him in silence until he had sealed the paper . Then he said : I guess they're trying people for forgery this morning ? No . Treason ! That's punishable by quartering dismembering a body into four parts quartering , said Jerry . How barbaric ! It's the law , answered the old clerk , surprised at this comment . The law is the law . It's a harsh law . It's bad enough to kill him , but it's worse to torture him , sir . 
 Nonsense , answered the old clerk . It's a good law . My advice is to take care of your own health , my friend , and let the law take care of itself . It's this damp weather , sir , that affects my health , said Jerry . My job often requires me to be out in wet weather . Well , we all have different ways of earning a living . Some of us have wet jobs and some of us have dry jobs . Here is the letter . Get going . Jerry took the letter . He bowed respectfully to the man , but under his breath he muttered , You're a mean , skinny old man . Jerry told his son where he was going and left for the Old Bailey . 
 Jerry Cruncher walked through the crowd like a man who was used to moving quietly . He found the door he was looking for and handed his letter through it . In those days people paid to see the trials at the Old Bailey , just like they paid to go to the theater or to visit the Bedlam insane asylum . The Old Bailey , however , cost much more , so the doors were well guarded . The only exception was the door through which the criminals entered , which was kept wide open . 
 After a few moments , the doorman reluctantly opened the door a little way and allowed Mr . Jerry Cruncher to squeeze into the courtroom . What case is this ? Jerry whispered to the man next to him . Nothing yet . What case is next ? The treason case . The one where they're going to quarter the man ? Yep ! answered the man excitedly . They'll hang him for a while , and then they'll take him down , cut him open , disembowel him , and burn his intestines right in front of his eyes so he can watch . Then they'll cut his head off and cut his body into four pieces . That's the punishment . If they decide he's guilty , you mean ? asked Jerry . 
 Mr . Cruncher noticed the doorkeeper , who was moving toward Mr . Lorry with the note in his hand . Mr . Lorry was sitting at a table with several gentlemen in wigs . Sitting near them were the prisoner's lawyer , who had a big pile of papers in front of him , and another man who had his hands in his pockets and kept looking at the ceiling . Jerry got Mr . Lorry's attention by coughing loudly and gesturing a few times . Mr . Lorry , who had stood up to look for him , nodded to Jerry and then sat down again . 
 What's he got to do with this case ? the man next to Jerry asked about Mr . Lorry . I have no idea , said Jerry . What do you have to do with it , if I may ask ? I don't know that either , said Jerry . The judge entered and everyone in the court got settled . Jerry and the man stopped talking . Everyone focused their attention on the dock , where the prisoner was to stand trial . Two jailers who had been standing there went out of the room . They came back with the prisoner and brought him to the bar . 
 Everyone stared at him except for the wigged gentleman who was still staring at the ceiling . People peeked around pillars and corners to get a glimpse of him . Those in the back rows stood up for a better look . People standing on the ground floor stood on their tiptoes or tried to push themselves up on other people's shoulders . 
 They were all staring at a young man about twenty-five years old , tall and good-looking , with sunburned cheeks and dark eyes . He looked like a young gentleman . He was dressed plainly in black or very dark gray . His hair was long and dark and was tied in a ribbon at the back of his neck , more to keep it out of his face than for the sake of fashion . Although he was sunburned , his cheeks were pale from nervousness . Otherwise , he appeared confident . He bowed to the judge and stood quietly . 
 The way the crowd ogled the man was not flattering for the human race . If his sentence wasn't such a horrible oneif there were any chance that he would be spared from any of the terrible things that were set to happen to himpeople would have lost interest . People had come to see the body that was soon to be horribly mutilated , butchered , and torn to pieces . Whatever these people told themselves as to why they were there , the truth was they were there out of a morbid fascination . 
 The prisoner didn't flinch or act out in any way , although he knew that every person in the courtroom was already picturing him being hanged , beheaded , and cut into pieces . He stood quietly , paying close attention to the court proceedings . He rested his hands on the slab of wood in front of him . He was so calm that he didn't disturb the vinegar and herbs , which had been scattered throughout the courtroom to protect everyone against disease . 
 A mirror hung over the prisoner's head to reflect light down onto him . Over the years this mirror had reflected the images of many poor and wicked prisoners who had eventually been put to death . If that mirror were ever able to send those reflections back out , the courtroom would have been filled with ghosts . The prisoner may have thought about how disgraceful it was to have this mirror there . He shifted and a shaft of light shining across his face made him look up . When he saw his reflection , he blushed and brushed the herbs off of the bar in front of him . 
 As he made this gesture , he turned his face to his left . His eyes fell upon two people sitting near the judge's bench . His expression changed so much when he saw them that everyone who was watching turned to look . 
 The two people were a young lady a little older than twenty years old and a gentleman who was apparently her father . He was a remarkable-looking man with white hair and an indescribable intensity in his face . This intense expression made him look like an old man . But when the expression left his face , as it had now while he talked to his daughter , he looked handsome and in the prime of his life . 
 His daughter sat arm in arm with her father . Her fear and pity for the prisoner had made her pull close to him . The expression on her forehead revealed her compassion for the prisoner . This expression was so heartbreaking that it moved even those people who had had no pity for the prisoner . The crowd whispered to one another , Who are they ? 
 Jerry , who had been observing the scene while he sucked the rust off of his fingers , leaned in to hear who they were . The crowd around him had passed the question forward to the person closest to the two people . The answer was slowly passed back until it got to Jerry : They are witnesses . For which side ? asked Jerry . Against . Against which side ? Against the prisoner . The judge turned to look at the two witnesses and called them to the stand . Then he leaned back in his chair and looked at the prisoner . The attorney general stood to state his case , to prove the man guilty and send him to his death . 
 The solicitor general , following the attorney general's lead , examined the witness : a gentleman named John Barsad . He described himself exactly as the attorney general had described him . In fact , his description was almost too similar . After he had been examined , he would have modestly gotten down from the witness box . But the wigged gentleman with the stack of papers , who was seated next to Mr . Lorry , stopped him . The other wigged gentleman , sitting across from him , was still staring at the ceiling . 
 There was another buzz in the courtroom , and the attorney general called Mr . Jarvis Lorry to the stand . Mr . Jarvis Lorry , are you a clerk at Tellson's Bank ? I am . On a certain Friday night in November 1775 , did your job require that you take the mail coach from London to Dover ? It did . Were there any other passengers in the coach ? Two other passengers . Did they get out of the coach at some point during the night ? Yes , they did . Mr . Lorry , look at the prisoner . Was he one of those two passengers ? I don't know . 
 Does he resemble either of the two passengers ? Both of them were bundled up , it was dark , and we all kept to ourselves , so I can't be sure if he looked like one of the passengers or not . Mr . Lorry , imagine the prisoner wrapped up like those two passengers . Is there anything about his build or height that would make you think that he was not one of them ? No . Mr . Lorry , you cannot say for sure that he was not one of those two men ? No . 
 So you're saying he might have been one of them ? Yes . Except that I remember them both being afraid of thieves , like I was , and the prisoner doesn't look like a man who's afraid of anything . Did you ever see someone pretend to be afraid , Mr . Lorry ? I certainly have . Mr . Lorry , look at the prisoner again . Have you ever seen him before ? I have . When ? I was coming back from France a few days afterward . The prisoner got on board our ship at Calais and came back to England with me . 
 What time did he come on board ? A little after midnight . In the middle of the night . Was he the only passenger that came on board so late ? Yes . He happened to be the only one . Forget about whether he ëhappened' to be the only one . Was he the only passenger to come on board in the middle of the night ? Yes , he was . Were you traveling alone , Mr . Lorry , or were you with someone ? I was with two other people . A gentleman and a lady . They are here in the courtroom . They are here . Did you speak with the prisoner ? Hardly . The weather was stormy , and the sea was rough . I was lying on the sofa for almost the entire trip . 
 To look at such a young , beautiful woman with such pity in her eyes was harder for the prisoner than the stares of the entire crowd . He couldn't stand still while looking at her , knowing he was about to die and knowing that everyone was watching him . He brushed the herbs in front of him into little lines , like beds of flowers in a garden . His lips trembled as he tried to steady his breathing . The crowd started to buzz again . 
 Miss Manette , have you seen the prisoner before ? Yes , sir . Where ? On board the ship Mr . Lorry just mentioned . At the same time . You are the young woman Mr . Lorry referred to ? Oh ! Unfortunately , I am . Just answer the questions simply , the judge said angrily , cutting off her compassionate voice . Don't comment on them .  Miss Manette , did you talk to the prisoner at all during the journey across the Channel ? Yes , sir . Describe the conversation . 
 When the prisoner came on board , he noticed that my father was very tired and weak . She looked at her father lovingly as he stood beside her . My father was in such bad condition that I was afraid to take him inside , and I made a bed for him on the deck near the cabin steps . I sat beside him taking care of him . We were the only four passengers on board that night . The prisoner was kind enough to suggest a better way to shield my father from the wind and weather . I had not known how to do it since I didn't understand how the wind would blow once we had left the harbor . The prisoner did it for me . 
 Let me interrupt you for a moment . Did he come on board alone ? No . How many people were with him ? Two French gentlemen . Did they speak together ? They spoke together until the very last moment , when the two French gentlemen took their boat back to shore . Did they pass any papers between them ? Papers similar to these lists ? They passed some papers between them , but I don't know what they were . Were they the same shape and size as these papers ? 
 They might have been , but I'm not sure . They stood close to me , whispering to each other . They were at the top of the cabin steps , near the light of the lamp . The lamp was dim , and they spoke very quietly . I did not hear what they said . I could only see that they were looking at some papers . Tell us about your conversation with the prisoner , Miss Manette .Because I was helpless , the prisoner was as open and honest with me as he was kind and helpful to my father . She burst into tears . I hope that I will not repay him today by doing him harm . 
 The courtroom buzzed with excitement . Miss Manette , everyone here , except maybe the prisoner , understands that you do not want to give this evidence today . You know , though , that it is your duty to do so . Please continue . He told me that he was traveling on business of a delicate and difficult nature that could get certain people into trouble . Because of this , he was using a false name . He said that this business had required him to go to France on short notice and that he might need to travel back and forth between France and England for a long time to come . 
 Did he say anything about America , Miss Manette ? Be specific . He tried to explain to me how the conflict in America had developed . He said that , in his opinion , it was wrong and foolish for England to fight . He joked that George Washington might someday be as famous a man in history as England's King George III . But he didn't mean any harm by this . He was only joking to pass the time . 
 A crowd will always mimic the expression on the face of an actor in a play they are watching . Miss Manette's forehead was wrinkled up as she gave her evidence , waited for the judge to write down what she said , and watched the lawyers to see how they would react . All the people in the crowd had the same expression on their foreheads , as if they were mirrors reflecting Miss Manette . The judge looked up , angered by the comment about George Washington . 
 The attorney general signaled to the judge that he needed to call the young woman's father to testify . The judge agreed , and Dr . Manette was called to the stand . Dr . Manette , look at the prisoner . Have you ever seen him before ? Yes , once . He came to my home in London about three or three and a half years ago . Can you identify him as the man you met on board the boat from Calais , or verify that he had this conversation with your daughter ? I can't do either , sir . 
 Is there some reason why ? There is , he answered quietly . Did you spend a long time in prison in France , Dr . Manette , without a trial or even being officially accused ? A long imprisonment , he answered in a tone that provoked pity . Had you just been released on the night in question ? That's what they tell me . Do you remember that night ? 
 Not at all . I don't remember anything from a long periodI can't even say how long . I've forgotten everything from the time when I was making shoes in prison to when I found myself living in London with my daughter . I began to recognize her when I started to get my senses back . I have no memory of how it happened , though . The attorney general sat down , and so did Dr . Manette and his daughter . 
 An important fact then came up in the case . The attorney general wanted to prove that the prisoner rode with some unknown accomplice in the Dover mail coach that Friday night in November five years earlier and got out sometime in the night . From there he backtracked about twelve miles or more to a military post and dockyard , where he gathered information . They called a witness who said he saw the prisoner around that time waiting for someone in the coffee room of the hotel in the town , near the military post and dockyard .
 The prisoner's lawyer cross-examined this witness and learned nothing except that the witness had never seen the prisoner before this time . Then , the wigged gentleman who had been staring at the ceiling the whole time wrote a word or two on a small scrap of paper , crumpled it up , and threw it at the prisoner's lawyer . The lawyer opened the piece of paper , paused , and looked curiously at the prisoner . 
 You're sure you saw the prisoner ? he asked the witness . The witness said he was sure . Have you ever seen anyone who looked like the prisoner ? Not so much like him that I could confuse the two , said the witness . Look closely at my esteemed friend over there , he said , pointing to the man who had tossed the paper . Now look closely at the prisoner . Do they look like each other ? 
 Except for the fact that the friend had a sloppy , unkempt appearance , the two men looked enough alike that the witness and everyone in the courtroom were surprised to notice it . The judge asked the man to take off his wig , and once he did they looked even more alike . The judge asked Mr . Stryver , the prisoner's lawyer , if they were going to try Mr . Carton , the other man , for treason . 
 Mr . Stryver answered that no , they would not . But he would ask the witness that , if this could happen once , could it have happened another time , and if he would have been so confident if this resemblance had been pointed out sooner . As a result , the credibility of the witness was completely ruined and his testimony became useless .  
 Mr . Stryver then called a few witnesses . Mr . Cruncher listened while the attorney general told the jury that everything Mr . Stryver had told them was wrong . Barsad and Cly were better men than he had originally thought , and the prisoner was a much worse man than he had originally thought . Finally , the judge himself spoke . He said some things in favor of the prisoner , and other things against him . Overall , his remarks made the prisoner appear to be guilty . At this point , the jury gathered to discuss their verdict . The courtroom buzzed with conversation .  
 Mr . Cruncher commented to the man next to him , I bet he doesn't get any work as a lawyer . He doesn't look like the type to get any , does he ? But Mr . Carton was paying closer attention to the scene than it appeared . When Miss Manette dropped her head onto her father's chest , he was the first person to say loudly , Officer ! Assist that young woman . Help the gentleman take her out of the room . Can't you see she's about to faint ? 
 The crowd was very sympathetic to her and her father as they left the courtroom . It had apparently been very stressful for him to think back on his time in prison . The questioning had clearly upset him , and that thoughtful or brooding expression that made him look older had been on his face ever since . As he was leaving , the foreman spoke on behalf of the jury , who were once again facing forward . 
 The jury had not come to a decision and wanted to go away to deliberate further . The judge , perhaps thinking about the prisoner's comment about George Washington , was surprised . But he signaled that they could go away under careful supervision , then he left the courtroom himself . The trial had lasted all day and the lamps in the court were being lit . A rumor spread that the jury would be deliberating for a long time . The spectators took a break and left the courtroom , and the prisoner moved to the back of the dock and sat down . 
 Mr . Lorry , who had left the courtroom with Miss Manette and her father , now came back in and motioned to Jerry . Jerry could now get near him easily since the crowd had left . Jerry , you can go get something to eat , but stay close by . I'm sure you will hear when the jury comes in . Get back here as soon as they do . I want you to take the verdict back to the bank . You're the fastest messenger I know , and you'll get back to Temple Bar much faster than I can . 
 Mr . Lorry gave him a shilling , and Jerry agreed to deliver the message . At that moment , Mr . Carton came up to Mr . Lorry and tapped him on the arm . How is the young lady ? She's very upset , but her father is comforting her . She feels better now that she is out of the courtroom . I'll tell the prisoner . It wouldn't be proper if people saw a respectable banker like you speaking to him in public . 
 Mr . Lorry blushed as if he had thought of this himself . Mr . Carton went over to the bar where the prisoner was sitting . The exit was in the same direction , and Jerry , with his spiked hair , followed behind him , watching and listening intently . Mr . Darnay ! said Mr . Carton . The prisoner immediately stepped forward . I'm sure you are anxious to hear how the witness , Miss Manette , is doing . She is doing very well . She got through the worst of it . I am very sorry that I caused her distress . Could you tell her for me , with my sincerest apologies ? Yes , I will tell her if you want me to . 
 Mr . Carton's attitude was so casual that it was almost rude . He stood there , partly facing away from the prisoner , leaning with his elbow against the bar . I would like that . Thank you . What verdict do you expect , Mr . Darnay ? Carton asked , still only partly facing him . Guilty . It's smart of you to expect that , as it's the most likely . But I think their long deliberation could work in your favor . Jerry didn't hear any more of their conversation , since he wasn't allowed to hang around . He left the two men , who looked so much like each other but were so different in their behavior , standing next to each other and reflected in the mirror above them . 
 An hour and a half went by slowly . The scoundrels in the crowd passed the time eating and drinking . Jerry , seated uncomfortably on a bench after eating dinner , had dozed off , when the murmuring crowd swept him up and carried him with them into the courtroom . Jerry ! Jerry ! Mr . Lorry was already calling for him when he arrived . I'm here , sir ! It's a fight to get back through this crowd . Here I am , sir ! 
 Mr . Lorry handed a piece of paper to him through the crowd . Quick ! Do you have it ? Yes , sir . The word Acquitted had been quickly scribbled down on the paper . If you had sent the message ëBrought back to life' again I would have understood it this time , muttered Jerry . Jerry didn't have time to say or think anything else until he was out of the Old Bailey . The crowd came pouring out of the courtroom so quickly that they nearly knocked him over , and their loud buzz spread into the streets as if they were flies in search of other carrion . 
 In brighter light it would have been difficult to tell that the intelligent looking Dr . Manette was the same man who had been a shoemaker in the attic in Paris . People couldn't help but look twice at him , even when they had not heard his low , sad voice or seen the dazed absentmindedness that overcame him at times without any apparent reason . A single reminder of his time in prison , like what had happened at the trial , could send him into depression . But it could also arise on its own , and send him into a gloomy state of mind . These mood changes were completely surprising to people who did not know his troubled history . It was as if the shadow of the Bastille a large prison in Paris Bastille were on him , even though the building was three hundred miles away . 
 Only his daughter could bring him back from this melancholy brooding . She was the one thing that connected his past , before his imprisonment , to his present . The sound of her voice , the look on her face , or the touch of her hand almost always made him feel better . There had a few times when she hadn't been able to help him , but these instances were rare and she felt they were now over . 
 Mr . Darnay kissed her hand passionately and gratefully , and thanked Mr . Stryver warmly . Mr . Stryver was not much older than thirty , but he looked fifty . He was fat , loud , red , and crude . He had a way of shoving himself , morally and physically , into groups and conversations , just as he was shoving his way up in the world . 
 Mr . Stryver still wore his wig and gown , and he stood in front of Mr . Darnay in such a way that Mr . Lorry was edged out of the conversation entirely . I am happy I represented you honorably , Mr . Darnay , said Mr . Stryver . It was a villainous case they had against you , but that doesn't mean they couldn't have succeeded . I am indebted to your for life , in two senses of the word , said Mr . Darnay , shaking his hand . I did my best for you , Mr . Darnay , though I only did as well as any other man would have . 
 It was obvious that someone was expected to say , You did much better than any other could have , so Mr . Lorry said it , hoping to squeeze himself back into the conversation . Do you think so ? asked Mr . Stryver . Well ! You've been here all day and you ought to know . You're a businessman , too . Mr . Stryver had now pushed Mr . Lorry back into the group , just as he had pushed him out before . And as a businessman , said Mr . Lorry , I will ask Dr . Manette to break up this conversation and order us all to go home . Miss Lucie looks ill , Mr . Darnay has had a terrible day , and everyone is exhausted . 
 Speak for yourself , Mr . Lorry , said Stryver . I have work to do tonight . Speak for yourself . I speak for myself , for Mr . Darnay , and for Miss Lucie , answered Mr . Lorry . Don't you think I can speak for all of us , Miss Lucie ? he asked her , glancing at her father . Dr . Manette was looking at Darnay strangely . It was an intense look that grew into a frown of dislike and distrust , mixed with fear . With this expression on his face his mind had wandered off . 
 Father . said Lucie , gently taking his hand . The look faded from his face , and he turned to look at her . Shall we go home , Father ? Yes , he answered with a long sigh . Mr . Darnay had told them that he would not be released that night , so the group went their separate ways . Almost all of the lamps in the hallways had been put out , and the iron gates were noisily being shut . The courthouse would be empty until another crowd arrived the next morning hoping to see people hanged , whipped , branded , or sent to the stocks . Lucie stepped outside and walked between her father and Mr . Darnay . They called a coach , and then Lucie and her father got in and left . 
 Mr . Stryver had left them in the hallway to push his way back to the changing room . A man who had not been in their group and hadn't spoken a word to any of them was leaning against the wall in the shadows . He had silently followed them out and had watched Dr . Manette and his daughter drive away in the coach . Now he came up to where Mr . Lorry and Mr . Darnay were standing on the street . So , Mr . Lorry ! Respected businessmen can now be seen talking publicly with Mr . Darnay again ? said Mr . Carton . 
 Nobody had mentioned the role Mr . Carton had played in the events of the day . Nobody had noticed him there . He wasn't wearing his robe anymore and looked worse than he had in the courtroom . If you knew how conflicted businessmen become when they are caught between doing the right thing and the professional thing , you would find it funny , Mr . Darnay , said Mr . Carton . Mr . Lorry blushed and said in a friendly manner , You have said that before , sir . We men of business , who work for a company , cannot think only of ourselves . We have to think of what's best for the company . 
 I know , I know , answered Mr . Carton casually . Don't get upset , Mr . Lorry . You are as good a man as any , I'm sure . Better , I might say . Really , sir , continued Mr . Lorry , ignoring him . I don't know what you have to do with any of this . Excuse me for saying so but , as a much older man than yourself , I really don't think it's any of your business . Business ! I have no business , said Mr . Carton . It's a shame that you don't , sir , said Mr . Lorry . I think so , too . If you did have business , continued Mr . Lorry , perhaps you could go take care of it . Lord bless you . No ! I wouldn't do that , said Mr . Carton . 
 Well , sir ! exclaimed Mr . Lorry , angered by Carton's casual attitude , business is a good and respectable thing . Being a businessman sometimes means you have to restrain yourself from doing what you would like to do . Mr . Darnay is a kind young gentleman who understands these things . Good night , Mr . Darnay . God bless you , sir ! I hope you have a prosperous , happy life in front of you . Chair ! a small carriage drawn by one horse Chair ! 
 Mr . Lorry may have been mad at both himself and Mr . Carton , and he climbed into the chair and headed off to Tellson's Bank . Carton , who smelled like port wine and appeared to be a bit drunk , laughed and turned to Darnay : It's pretty odd that you and I are here together . This must be a strange night for you , standing here alone on the street with a man who looks just like you . I still don't feel like I belong to the world of the living , answered Charles Darnay . 
 I feel weak . Then why don't you eat dinner ? I ate dinner myself while those idiots in the jury were arguing about whether you should live or die . Let me show you the closest good tavern . Mr . Carton took his arm and led Mr . Darnay down Ludgate Hill to Fleet Street and up a covered passageway into a tavern . They were brought into a small room where Charles Darnay soon restored his strength with a simple dinner and some good wine . Carton , still as rude as ever , sat across from him at the same table with his own bottle of port . 
 Do you feel like you belong to the world of the living yet , Mr . Darnay ? I'm quite disoriented , but I'm well enough to feel like I am . You must be very happy about that ! He spoke bitterly and refilled his large wine glass . As for me , said Mr . Carton , my greatest wish is to forget that I belong to this world . It has nothing good in store for me except this wine . And I have nothing for it . You and I are very different in that way . Actually , I'm starting to think that you and I aren't that similar after all . 
 Mr . Darnay was confused by the emotions of the day , and it felt like a dream to be with this man who looked so much like himself , but behaved so roughly . He didn't know how to respond to this statement , and finally , he decided not to answer at all . Now that you've finished eating , Mr . Darnay , Carton said , why don't you propose a toast ? What toast ? Why , it's on the tip of your tongue . You should know what it is . You must . I'm sure you do . To Miss Manette , then ! To Miss Manette ! 
 Staring into Mr . Darnay's face while he drank to the toast , Carton flung his wine glass over his shoulder against the wall , where it shattered . Then he rang the bell and ordered another . That's a beautiful young lady to send away in a coach at night , Mr . Darnay ! he said , handling his new glass . Yes , said Mr . Darnay , frowning slightly . How does it feel to have such a beautiful young woman pity you and weep for you ? Is it worth being put on trial for your life to be the object of such sympathy and compassion , Mr . Darnay ? 
 Again Darnay didn't answer . She was very happy to receive your message when I gave it to her . She didn't show that she was pleased , but I think she was . This comment reminded Darnay that Carton had helped him by delivering this message . He turned the conversation to that fact and thanked him for his help . I don't want or deserve any thanks , he said casually . First of all , it was nothing . And second , I don't even know why I did it . Let me ask you a question , Mr . Darnay . 
 Of course . It's the least I could do for your favor . Do you think that I like you ? Really , Mr . Carton , answered Mr . Darnay , a bit flustered by the question , I haven't thought much about it . Think about it now . You have acted as if you liked me , but I don't think you actually do . I don't think I do like you , said Carton . I'm starting to think highly of your intelligence . Regardless of whether you like me , there isn't any reason why I shouldn't thank you for your help , and we should part on good terms , said Mr . Darnay . He got up to ring the service bell . 
 Carton answered , Not on your life ! Darnay rang the bell . Do you call us even ? Mr . Darnay answered that yes , he did . Then bring me another pint of this wine , waiter , and wake me in my room at ten o'clock . They paid the bill and Charles Darnay got up and wished Mr . Carton good night . Without wishing Darnay good night in return , Mr . Carton also got up and said defiantly , One last thing , Mr . Darnay . Do you think I am drunk ? 
 I think you have been drinking , Mr . Carton . You think ? You know I have been drinking . Yes , I know it . Then I will tell you why . I am unhappy and overworked , sir . I don't like anyone in the world , and no one likes me . I'm sorry to hear that . You might have put your skills to better use . Perhaps , Mr . Darnay . Perhaps not . Don't let your sober self get too excited . You don't know what trouble you might get yourself into . Good night ! When he was alone , Mr . Carton picked up the candle and went over to a mirror hanging on the wall . He looked at himself closely in it . 
 Do you like that man ? he mumbled to his reflection . Why should you like a man who looks like you ? There is nothing likable about you . You know that . Ah , you're confused ! How much you've changed ! That man reminds you of what you used to be like and what you might have become . That's a good reason to like him . If you traded places with him , would Miss Manette have looked at you with her blue eyes the way she looked at him ? Would she have been as concerned if you had been on trial ? Come on and say it plainly . You hate that man . 
 People drank a lot in those days . The situation is better today . The amount of alcohol that a man back then could drink in one night and still remain respectable would seem ridiculous to people today . Lawyers drank as much as people in any other profession . Mr . Stryver , who was already shoving his way to being very wealthy and successful , equaled his peers in drinking just as much as he did in matters of the law . 
 Mr . Stryver had been popular at the Old Bailey and at the Sessions lower criminal court Sessions , but he had started to leave his colleagues behind as his ambition drove him forward . The Sessions and the Old Bailey now had to summon him to get him to visit . Mr . Stryver could be seen every day shoving himself past these old colleagues into the view of the Lord Chief Justice in the Court of King's Bench , like a sunflower shoving past the nearby flowers toward the sun . 
 It was once said at the bar that although Mr . Stryver was persuasive , immoral , bold , and well prepared , he was not skilled at getting to the core of complex matters , which is one of the most important skills a lawyer needs . He was improving , though . The more cases he worked on , the better he became at finding the crux of an argument . And no matter how late he stayed up drinking with Sydney Carton , he was always well prepared the next morning . 
 Sydney Carton , who was lazy and unimpressive , was Mr . Stryver's greatest asset . You could have kept one of the king's ships afloat on the amount of liquor the two of them drank together between Hilary Term and Michaelmas two of the four terms that made up the legal year Hilary Term and Michaelmas . If Stryver was on a case , Carton was there with his hands in his pockets staring at the courtroom ceiling . They worked on cases for the circuit court , and they stayed up drinking late into the night . Carton could sometimes be seen stumbling back home , disheveled and drunk , in broad daylight .
 Ten o'clock , sir , said the man at the tavern . Ten o'clock , sir . What's the matter ? asked Carton . Ten o'clock , sir . What do you mean ? Ten o'clock at night ? Yes , sir . You told me to wake you . Oh ! I remember . Very well , very well . After a few feeble attempts to go back to sleep , which the servant prevented by continuously stirring the fire for five minutes , Mr . Carton got up . He put his hat on and walked out . He turned into Temple Bar , and he tried to revive himself by walking back and forth along the street . Then he entered Stryver's home . 
 Stryver's assistant , who never assisted him at these meetings , had gone home , and Stryver opened the door himself . He had slippers on and a loose bed gown . His collar was open to be more comfortable . He had that wild , strained look in his eyes that people of his class who drink too much have had for ages . You could see it in the portraits of Jeffreys George Jeffreys , a notorious Lord Chief Justice of England Jeffreys on down through every Drinking Age . 
 You're a little late , Memory , said Stryver . I'm here around the usual time . Maybe I'm fifteen minutes late . They went into a dirty little room , filled with books and papers , where there was a blazing fire . A kettle was steaming on the stove , an in the middle of the mess of papers , there was a table with wine , brandy , rum , sugar , and lemons . I see you've already had a bottle of wine , Sydney . Two tonight , I think . I've been eating with today's client . Or watching him eat . It's all the same . 
 That was an important point that you brought up about identifying Mr . Darnay . How did you think of it ? I thought that he was rather a good-looking man , and I thought I would have been the same kind of man , if I'd had any luck . Mr . Stryver laughed until his belly shook . You and your luck , Sydney ! Get to work , get to work . Mr . Carton loosened his clothes gloomily and went into another room . He came back with a large jug of cold water , a basin , and one or two towels . Dipping the towels in the water and partially wringing them out , he placed them sloppily on his head and sat down at the table . Now I am ready ! he said . 
 Not much work to be done tonight , Memory , said Mr . Stryver happily as he looked at his papers . How much ? Only two sets of them . Give me the worst one first . Here they are , Sydney . Fire away ! Mr . Stryver lay down on his back on the sofa on one side of the drinking table . Mr . Carton sat at his own table , which was covered with papers , on the other side , with the bottles and glasses within reach . Both of them were using the drinking table but in different ways . 
 Mr . Stryver was lying back with his hands in his waistband looking at the fire , occasionally looking over some simple document . Mr . Carton , frowning intently , worked so steadily that he didn't even look up when he reached for his glass . He often groped around for it for a minute or two before finding it . Two or three times the business he was working on became so difficult that Mr . Carton had to get up and soak his towels again . He would return from the water basin wearing the strangest combinations of wet towels on his head . These looked especially ridiculous because he was so serious about his work . 
 After a while Mr . Carton put together a small meal for the lion , Mr . Stryver , to eat . Mr . Stryver took it from him carefully . He picked out what he wanted and commented on it , and Mr . Carton responded . After they had discussed the meal , Mr . Stryver put his hands in his waistband again and lied down to think . Mr . Carton would then energize himself with a glass of punch and fresh towels , and put together a second meal . He served it to Mr . Stryver in the same manner , and he didn't finish his work until three in the morning . 
 And now that we're finished , Sydney , fill a glass of punch , said Mr . Stryver . Mr . Carton took the towels off of his head , which was steaming again . He shook himself , yawned , shivered , and did what Mr . Stryver said . You did well with those witnesses for the prosecution today , Sydney . Don't I always do well ? I'm not questioning it . What has put you in such a bad mood ? Have some punch . That will improve your mood . With a disapproving grunt , Mr . Carton did what he was told . 
 You're acting just like you did back when we were at Shrewsbury School a famous school for boys Shrewsbury School , said Stryver , nodding his head as he thought about Mr . Carton in the past and present . Sydney the seesaw ! Up one minute and down the next . In a good mood one minute , in a bad mood the next . Ah ! Mr . Carton sighed . Yes ! I'm the same Sydney , with the same bad luck . Even then , I did other boys' homework and rarely did my own . And why not ? God only knows . It was just the way I was , I guess . He sat with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out in front of him , looking at the fire . 
 Carton , said Mr . Stryver , turning toward him forcefully as if he could bully him into becoming ambitious . You've always been lazy . You have no energy or purpose . Look at me . Don't bother me , answered Sydney , with a somewhat cheerful laugh . Don't you moralize . 
 How have I done all I have done ? How do I do what I do ? Partly by paying me to help you , I suppose . But don't bother lecturing me about it . You do what you want to do . You were always on the front lines , and I was always in back . I had to push my way to the front lines . I wasn't born there , was I ? I wasn't there at your birth , but I think that you were , said Carton . He laughed again , and then they both laughed together . 
 Before Shrewsbury , and at Shrewsbury , and ever since Shrewsbury , continued Carton , you have always been ahead and I have always been behind . Even when we were in Paris studying French and French law , and trying to learn other French things that weren't very good for us , you were always going somewhere and I was always going nowhere . And whose fault was that ? On my life , I'm not sure that it wasn't your fault . You were always pushing and shoving and striving ahead . I had no chance but to sit back and waste away . It's depressing , though , to talk about the past at the beginning of a new day . Change the subject for me before I leave . 
 Well then ! Let's talk about that pretty witness , said Stryver , holding his glass . Is that a more pleasant topic ? Apparently it wasn't , for he got depressed again . Pretty witness , muttered Carton , staring into his glass . I've had enough of witnesses today and tonight . Which pretty witness are you talking about ? Miss Manette , the doctor's beautiful daughter . She ? Pretty ? said Carton . Isn't she ? No . Why , everyone in the courtroom was admiring her ! Who cares ? Who made the Old Bailey a judge of beauty ? She looked like a blond doll . 
 Do you know , Sydney , said Mr . Stryver , looking at him intently and wiping his face with his hand . You know , during the trial I thought you sympathized with the blond doll , and were interested to see what happened to that blond doll . Interested to see what happened to her ? A man can tell if a girl is about to faint right in front of his face . I agree to that , but I deny that she's beautiful . I'm done drinking . I'm going to bed . 
 Mr . Stryver followed Mr . Carton with a candle to show him the way down the stairs . The day looked cold through the grimy windows . When he left the house , it was cold and sad outside . The sky was gray and overcast . The river was dark . The whole scene looked like a lifeless desert . Clouds of dust were blowing around in the morning wind , as if the desert sand had risen far away and was about to cover London . 
 Feeling empty , with this desert all around , Mr . Carton stopped as he crossed an empty terrace and stood still . For a moment he imagined a life filled with honor , ambition , sacrifice , and hard work . It was a life filled with hope and possibility . The fantasy lasted only a moment , and then it was gone . He climbed to his room high up in a group of houses . He threw himself down on his unmade bed still wearing his clothes , his pillow wet with tears cried for his wasted life . 
 Dr . Manette's quiet apartment was on a quiet street corner near Soho Square . It was a fine Sunday afternoon four months after Mr . Darnay's trial for treason . By now the public had forgotten all about it . Mr . Jarvis Lorry walked along the sunny streets from his home in Clerkenwell to dine with Dr . Manette . After falling back a few times into being consumed by his work , Mr . Lorry had become friends with Dr . Manette , and his visits to Dr . Manette made up the happiest part of his life . 
 On this particular fine Sunday , Mr . Lorry walked toward Soho early in the afternoon for three reasons . First of all , on nice Sundays he often went out for a walk with the doctor and Lucie before lunch . Secondly , on Sundays when the weather was bad , he often spent the day with them as a family friend at their house , talking , reading , looking out the window , and generally getting through the day . Thirdly , he had his own problems to work out , and the time at the doctor's house was a good time to work them out . 
 There wasn't a nicer street corner in London than the corner where Dr . Manette lived . It was a dead end , and there was a pleasant little view of the street from the front windows of his apartment that provided a sense of being away from the commotion . There weren't many buildings north of Oxford Road back then . Trees and wildflowers flourished , and hawthorn grew all over the fields that have since disappeared . Because of this , country air flowed briskly through Soho instead of fading away into the countryside like beggars without a home . There were many peach trees nearby , growing up against the south walls of the buildings . 
 The street corner Dr . Manette lived on was well lit by sunlight early in the day , but in the hot part of the day , the corner was in shade , though not in such a large shadow that you couldn't see past it into the sunlight . It was a cool spot , calm but cheerful . It was a good place to hear echoes and escape the noise of the busy city streets . It was fitting that the doctor's quiet home was on such as a quiet street . He lived in two floors of a large stiff house where several businesses were supposedly open during the day . But they made almost no noise during the daytime , and they were completely silent at night . 
 There was a building in back that was only reachable by a courtyard where a plane tree grew . In the building there was a shop that claimed to make church organs , engrave silver , and make items out of gold . The golden arm of a mysterious giant stuck out of the wall of the front hall , as if he had beaten himself golden and might threaten to do the same to any visitors . Noise was rarely heard from these businesses , or from the one lodger who was said to live upstairs , or from the dumb maker of coach-trimmings who claimed to have an accounting house downstairs . Once in a while a stray workman , putting his coat on , would walk across the hall , or a stranger would come looking around . Sometimes you would hear a clink in the distance across the courtyard or the golden giant would make a thump . These were the only sounds to be heard . Otherwise , the sparrows in the plane tree behind the house and the echoes in the corner were the only sounds to be heard all week . 
 Here , Dr . Manette met with the few patients he had acquired by his old reputation and its revival by the rumors about his imprisonment . His knowledge of science and the clever experiments he conducted also brought him work , and he was able to earn as much money as he wanted . Mr . Jarvis Lorry knew all this about Dr . Manette and had it in mind when he rang Dr . Manette's doorbell on that fine Sunday afternoon . 
 Is Dr . Manette home ? he asked the handmaid who answered the door . The handmaid answered that he was expected home soon . Is Miss Lucie home ? The handmaid answered that she too was expected home soon . Is Miss Pross home ? The handmade answered that she might be at home but that she couldn't say for sure . Since I feel at home here myself , I'll go upstairs , said Mr . Lorry . Even though Miss Manette had known nothing about France , she apparently had innately developed the ability to make much of very little , which is one of the most useful and pleasant skills of the French people . 
 Even though it was simply furnished , the room was decorated with many little ornaments . These ornaments weren't expensive , but they were tasteful and interesting and had a delightful effect on the room . The look of everything in the apartment , from the largest to the smallest objects , the color scheme , the elegance of the variety , and contrast of little decorations , were pleasing and expressive of Miss Manette's taste . So much so that , as Mr . Lorry stood looking around , the furniture seemed to wear the same expression that he had seen so many times on Miss Manette's forehead . As a result , the tables and chairs themselves seemed to ask him if he liked the way the room had been decorated . 
 There were three rooms on each floor , and the doors of each room had been left open to air them out . Mr . Lorry , smiling as he thought of that resemblance to Lucie Manette that he saw all around him , walked from one room to another . The first room was the nicest . In it were Lucie's pet birds , flowers , books , a desk , a worktable , and a box of watercolor paints . The second room was Dr . Manette's consulting room , which they also used as a dining room . The third room was the doctor's bedroom . Light filtered in through the leaves of the plane tree outside the window and speckled the walls and floor in shifting patterns . In the corner stood the unused shoemaker's bench and a tray of tools . It looked the same as it had on the fifth floor of that miserable house near the wine shop in the suburb of Saint Antoine in Paris . 
 It's strange that he keeps that reminder of his suffering near him , said Mr . Lorry , looking around . And why is that strange ? was the unexpected question that made him jump . The question came from Miss Pross . She was the strong , wild , red woman whom he had first met at the Royal George Hotel in Dover . Mr . Lorry got along with her much better now . I should have thought Mr . Lorry began . Pooh ! You'd have thought ! said Miss Pross , and Mr . Lorry stopped talking . How are you ? the lady then asked . She said it harshly , but still trying to be friendly . 
 I am pretty well , thank you , answered Mr . Lorry meekly . How are you ? Nothing to brag about , said Miss Pross . Indeed ? Ah ! Indeed ! said Miss Pross . I am very unhappy about Miss Manette . Indeed ? For goodness sake , say something besides ëindeed , ' or you'll annoy me to death , said Miss Pross . She had a tendency to be short with people , although she was rather a tall woman . Really , then ? said Mr . Lorry , changing his phrase . ëReally' is bad , but it's better than ëindeed . ' Yes , I am very unhappy . 
 May I ask why ? I don't want dozens of people who are unworthy of Miss Manette coming here to looking for her , said Miss Pross . Do dozens of people come here for that ? Hundreds , said Miss Pross . Miss Pross had the habit , like many other people before and after her , to exaggerate her point after someone questioned it . Dear me ! said Mr . Lorry . It was the safest thing he could think to say . I have lived with heror rather , she has lived with mesince she was ten years old and paid me for it . She certainly shouldn't have if I could have afforded to take care of her or myself for nothing . It's been very hard , said Miss Pross . 
 Mr . Lorry didn't understand what exactly was very hard , so he shook his head . He used this gesture of shaking his head as a kind of magical cloak , which would fit any occasion the way a magical cloak would fit anyone . All sorts of people who are not worthy of her keep showing up , said Miss Pross . When you started itWhen I started it , Miss Pross ? Didn't you ? Who brought her father back to life ? Oh ! If that's what you mean by starting it said Mr . Lorry . 
 It wasn't ending it , was it ? As I was saying , when you started it , it was hard enough . Not that I can blame Dr . Manette , except that he doesn't deserve to have such a daughter . This isn't his fault , for it can't be expected that anyone would be worthy under the circumstances . But it really is two or three times harder to have crowds of people showing up after himI could have forgiven himto take Miss Manette's affections away from me . 
 Mr . Lorry knew that Miss Pross could be a jealous woman , but he also knew by now that she was , beneath all her odd behavior , unselfish in a way that only women can be . She was the type of woman who would , for love and admiration , commit herself like a slave to a woman . She would commit to a young woman , though she herself was old . Or to a beautiful woman , though she had never been beautiful . Or to a successful woman , though she had no accomplishments . Or to a hopeful woman , though she'd never had hope in her own life . 
 Mr . Lorry knew enough about the world to know that there is nothing better than true love and devotion that is free from selfish motives . When he thought of the rewards of the afterlife (we all sometimes think of such things) , he placed Miss Pross much closer to the lower angels than some of the most beautiful women , either naturally beautiful or who had made themselves beautiful with makeup and fine clothes , who had money at Tellson's Bank . 
 There has only ever been one man worthy of Miss Manette , said Miss Pross . That was my brother , Solomon , if he hadn't made a mistake in life . Mr . Lorry's questions about Miss Pross's personal life had taught him that Solomon was a heartless crook who had taken everything she owned and had lost it in bad investments . He had abandoned her and had left her destitute forever , and had never felt the slightest guilt about it . Mr . Lorry took very seriously Miss Pross's faith in Solomon and the fact that she only blamed him a little bit for this huge betrayal . It had an effect on his good opinion of her . 
 As we happen to be alone here together and are both businesspeople , he said when they had gone back into the drawing room and had sat down together , let me ask you a question . Does Dr . Manette ever speak to Lucie about his time making shoes in prison ? Never . And yet he keeps his bench and tools near him ? Ah ! I didn't say he never thinks of it himself , answered Miss Pross , shaking her head . Do you believe he thinks of it often ? I do , said Miss Pross . 
 Do you imagine Mr . Lorry started , but Miss Pross cut him off with : Never imagine anything . It's better to have no imagination at all . I stand corrected . Do you supposeyou do suppose still , don't you ? Now and then , said Miss Pross . Do you suppose , continued Mr . Lorry with a twinkle in his eye as he looked at her kindly , that Dr . Manette has any idea as to why he was imprisoned ? Or that he perhaps even knows who sent him to prison ? I don't suppose anything but what Miss Manette tells me . And that isÖ ? She thinks that he does . Now don't get mad at me for asking all of these questions . I am only a dull businessman . You are a businesswoman . 
 Wishing he hadn't used that adjective to describe himself , he answered , No , no . Surely not . But to get back to business . Isn't it remarkable that Dr . Manette , since he is definitely innocent of any crime , doesn't talk about that question ? Not that he should talk about it with me , although we had a business relationship long ago and now we are friends . But with his daughter , whom he is so devoted to and who is devoted to him ? Believe me , Miss Pross , I don't bring it up out of mere curiosity , but because I am deeply interested in the matter . 
 Well ! As well as I understand it , which is not well at all , he is afraid of the whole topic , said Miss Pross . Afraid ? I think it's clear enough why he would be . It's a dreadful thing to remember . Besides that , he lost part of himself in prison . Not knowing how he lost himself , or how he eventually found himself again , he might never feel certain that he won't lose himself again . That alone would make it an unpleasant subject , I would think .  
 It can't be helped , said Miss Pross , shaking her head . If you bring up the subject at all , his mood instantly changes for the worse . It's best to leave it alone . In short , we must leave it alone whether you want to or not . Sometimes he gets up in the middle of the night . We can hear him upstairs pacing up and down in his room . Miss Manette knows that in his mind he is pacing up and down in his old prison cell . She rushes to him and they continue together , pacing up and down , up and down , until he is calm again . But he never speaks a word to her of the real reason for his restlessness , and she thinks its best not to bring it up . They pace up and down together in silence until her love and companionship bring him back to his senses . 
 Miss Pross claimed not to have an imagination . But there was something in her understanding of being haunted by a single sad idea , and in her repetition of the phrase pacing up and down , that made Mr . Lorry think that she had an imagination after all . The street corner , as was mentioned earlier , was a good place for echoes . Mr . Lorry could now hear the echo of footsteps coming toward them as if the mention of pacing up and down had started it . They're here ! said Miss Pross , getting up from her chair . And soon there will be hundreds of people here to visit Miss Manette ! 
 The acoustics were so strange in the street corner that , as Mr . Lorry stood near the open window , he could hear the doctor's and Miss Manette's footsteps but still couldn't see them . He thought they would never arrive . Not only would echoes die out as though the doctor and Miss Manette had walked away , but echoes of other footsteps would be heard instead and would die away for good when it seemed like they were close by . Finally , Dr . Manette and Miss Manette appeared and Miss Pross was waiting for them at the door . 
 By lunchtime still no hundreds of people had arrived . In the management of their little household , Miss Pross was always in charge of the lower floors and did a good job with them . The lunches she made were very modest but were well cooked and well presented . They were so interesting , being half English and half French , that nothing could have been better . Miss Pross , being a very practical woman , would search Soho and other nearby neighborhoods for poor French people , and she would pay them shillings and half crowns to tell her their secret recipes . 
 She had learned such wonderful cooking skills from these poor French men and women that the woman and girl servants at the house thought of her as a witch , or Cinderella's fairy godmother . She could take a chicken , rabbit , or vegetable from the garden and turn it into whatever she wanted to like magic . On Sundays , Miss Pross ate at the same table as the doctor , but on other days she insisted on eating at unknown times , either downstairs or in her own room on the second floor . Her room was a blue room that no one was allowed to enter except for Lucie . On this occasion , Miss Pross went out of her way to make a good meal to please the beautiful Lucie , so the food was very good . 
 It was a hot day , and after lunch Lucie suggested that they take their wine out under the plane tree , where they could sit in the fresh air . As everyone always did what Lucie wanted , they all went out under the plane tree . Lucie carried the wine down for Mr . Lorry . She had taken on the role of Mr . Lorry's cup bearer , and while they sat under the plane tree talking , she made sure his glass was always full . They could see the backs of other houses from where they sat talking , and the wind blew gently through the leaves of the plane tree above their heads . 
 Hundreds of people still did not arrive . Mr . Darnay came by while they were sitting under the plane tree , but he was the only one . Dr . Manette welcomed him kindly , and so did Lucie . Miss Pross , however , suddenly started twitching in her head and body and went into the house . This often happened to her , and she would refer to it among friends as a fit of jerks . 
 The doctor was in the best health and looked especially young . At such times he looked very much like Lucie . As they sat there , side-by-side , she leaning against his shoulder and he resting his arm on the back of her chair , it was very pleasant to see the similarity . He had been talking all day about all sorts of things in an unusually lively way . Say , Dr . Manette , said Mr . Darnay as they sat under the plane tree , have you seen much of the Tower of London ? He said it in regards to the topic they were discussing at the time , which happened to be the old buildings of London . 
 Lucie and I have passed by it , but only casually . We have seen enough of it to know that it's very interesting . That's all . I have been there , as you know , said Darnay , smiling , though his face turned a bit red with anger , in a different way , and not in a way that allows someone to see much of it . They told me something interesting when I was there . What was that ? asked Lucie . Some workmen stumbled upon an old dungeon while they were making renovations . It had been built over and forgotten for many years . 
 On every stone of the inner wall there were inscriptions of dates , names , complaints , and prayers that had been carved by prisoners . On a stone in a corner , one prisoner , who it seems was eventually executed , had carved three letters . They were carved with a dull instrument , and they were done in a hurry with an unsteady hand . At first they read the letters as D . I . C . , but when they looked more carefully the last letter turned out to be a G . There was no record of a prisoner being there with those initials , and no one could guess what the name could have been . After a long time it was suggested that the letters weren't initials , but the word dig . 
 Father ! You're sick ! cried Lucie . Dr . Manette had jumped up suddenly , with his hand to his head . His behavior and look frightened them . No , my dear . I'm not sick . There are large drops of rain falling , and they made me jump . We had better go inside . He recovered almost immediately . Rain really was falling in large drops , and he showed them the rain drops on the back of his hand . But he didn't say a word about the discovery Mr . Darnay had mentioned . As they went into the house , Mr . Lorry's analytical eyes saw , or thought they saw , the same look on the doctor's face , as he turned it toward Charles Darnay , as he had when he had turned toward him in the hallways of the courthouse at the Old Bailey . 
 The look vanished so quickly , however , that Mr . Lorry doubted that he had seen anything at all . The doctor was now steadier than the arm of the golden giant in the hallway . He stopped under it to say that he was still vulnerable to slight surprises (he might always be) , and the rain had surprised him . At teatime , while Miss Pross made tea , she had another twitching fit like she had before , and hundreds of people had still not arrived to visit Miss Manette . Mr . Carton had arrived , but he was only the second person to come by . 
 It was such a hot night that , although they had the doors and windows open , they were overpowered by the heat . When they were done with the tea table , they all moved to one of the windows and looked out into the dusk . Lucie sat by her father , Darnay sat beside her , and Carton leaned against the window . The wind from the thunder gusts blew the long , white curtains up near the ceiling like the ghostly wings . 
 The rain is still falling in large , heavy , sparse drops , said Dr . Manette . The drops come slowly . The storm is on its way , said Carton . They spoke quietly , the way people speak when they are waiting for something , the way people speak in a dark room while waiting to see lightning . People were running through the streets trying to get inside before the storm broke . The street corner was filled with the echoes of footsteps coming and going , even though no one could actually be seen walking there . It sounds like so many people , and yet no one is there ! said Darnay after they had listened for a while . 
 Isn't it impressive , Mr . Darnay ? asked Lucie . Some nights I have sat here until I have imaginedbut even something silly I have imagined makes me shudder tonight , when everything is so dark and seriousLet us shudder too . Tell us what it is . It will seem like nothing to you . Such ideas are only interesting as we make them up , I think . They shouldn't be told to others . I have sometimes sat here alone at night , listening until I have imagined that all of the echoes are the echoes of the footsteps of the people that will soon be coming into our lives . 
 A lot of people will be coming into our lives if that's the case , added Sydney Carton in his moody way . The footsteps never stopped . They sped up more and more , and the corner echoed and re-echoed with their sound . Some seemed to be under the windows , and some seemed to be in the room . Some were coming and some were going . Some of them were breaking off and some stopped altogether . All were in the streets in the distance , and no one was in sight . 
 Are all these people making these footsteps destined to come to all of us here ? Or do we divide them among us ? I don't know , Mr . Darnay . I told you it was my silly imagination , but you asked to hear it . When I've let my mind wander like this , I've been alone , and then I've imagined that they were the footsteps of the people who will come into my life . And my father's life . I'll accept them into my life ! said Carton . I ask no questions and have no conditions . There are a lot of people coming toward us , Miss Manetteand I can see them by the lightning . He added the last words just after a bright flash of lightning , which illuminated him as he lounged in the window . 
 And I hear them ! he added , after a roar of thunder . Here they come , fast , fierce , and furious ! He was talking about the rush and roar of rain , and he stopped talking because he couldn't be heard over the rain . A terrific storm of thunder and lightning broke , and the thunder , lightning , and rain did not stop even for an instant until after the moon rose at midnight . The bell at Saint Paul's Cathedral struck one o'clock in the now clear air . Mr . Lorry headed home to Clerkenwell , escorted by Jerry , who wore high boots and carried a lantern . 
 There were lonely parts of the road on the way between Soho and Clerkenwell , and Mr . Lorry worried about thieves and always used Jerry for a ride home , though he usually headed home two hours earlier . What a night it has been ! said Mr . Lorry . Almost a night that would bring the dead out of their graves , Jerry . I've never seen a night that would do that . And I don't expect to , answered Jerry . Good night , Mr . Carton , said Mr . Lorry . Good night , Mr . Darnay . Do you think we'll ever see such a night together again ? They might . They might also see a great roaring crowd of people come rushing at them , too . 
 The monseigneur , one of the great and powerful lords of the court , held a reception every two weeks at his grand hotel in Paris . The monseigneur was in his private room , and the crowd of people in the outer rooms worshipped the monseigneur and treated his private room like a holy sanctuary . The monseigneur was about to have his chocolate . He could swallow anything easilya few unhappy people were even saying that he was quickly swallowing all of Francebut he couldn't eat his morning chocolate without the help of four strong men , as well as the cook . 
 Yes , it took four men . All of them were dressed extravagantly , and the one in charge had two gold watches in his pocket , following the monseigneur's noble and chaste example . One servant carried the pot of chocolate to the monseigneur , the second stirred up the chocolate with a little instrument , a third brought him his napkin , and a fourththe one with two watchespoured out the chocolate . The monseigneur couldn't have gotten rid of one of these servants without losing his admired place in the world .
 He would have brought great shame to his family crest if he had had only three servants . Having only two would have killed him . Monseigneur had been out to dinner the night before , where the Comedy and the Grand Opera had been performed . Monseigneur went out to dinner most nights , and there were always interesting people around . He was so polite and easily swayed that the Comedy and the Grand Opera influenced his opinion on matters of government and state secrets far more than the country's needs did . This wasn't good for France , as it's never good for a country to be ruled by frivolous leaders , like when the merry Stuart King Charles II Stuart ruled England . 
 The monseigneur had one truly noble idea about public business in general : to let everything continue on its own . For specific kinds of public business he had another respectable idea : that it should benefit him personally and give him more power or money . He believed that the world had been created to bring him pleasure . The text of his class , which had only been changed by one pronoun , read , The earth and its fullness are mine , says the monseigneur . 
 However , the monseigneur had slowly discovered that things were not going well in his private and public financial affairs , so he had become close with the tax collector . The monseigneur relied on the tax collector for public financial matters because he didn't understand them and had to rely on someone who could . He relied on him for private finance , because tax collectors were rich , and after many years of living in luxury the monseigneur was running out of money . He had pulled his sister out of a convent before she had become a nun (where she would have worn a veilthe cheapest garment she could wear) . Instead , he made her marry a very rich tax collector whose family was of a lower class . 
 This tax collector , who was appropriately carrying a cane with a golden apple on top , was one of the people in the other room . Most people groveled before the tax collector . All except people of a higher class like the monseigneur , and even his own wife , who looked down on him with contempt . The tax collector was an extravagant man . He had thirty horses in his stables , twenty-four manservants in his house , and six maids served his wife . Though his in-laws looked down on him , the tax collector was the most honest of the people at the monseigneur's hotel that day as he didn't hide the fact that all he did was steal and take what he could . 
 Elegant , well-bred gentlemen , who , then just as now , have been known by their lack of interest in any interesting subject , were in a fine state of exhaustion at the monseigneur's . The spies in the upper-class world of Paris would have had trouble finding one wife in the homes of these men who would admit that she was a mother . 
 The comforting part was that everyone at the monseigneur's hotel was perfectly dressed . If the day of Judgment was a day on which one's clothing were judged , everyone would have been fine for eternity . People frizzled and powdered and stuck their hair up . Their delicate skin was preserved and covered in makeup . The men wore attractive swords , and everyone smelled good . All of this would surely keep anything going forever . The elegant gentlemen of the best breeding wore little decorations that clinked as they strolled around . These golden chains rang like precious little bells . That ringing , and the rustle of silk and expensive cloth , caused a flutter in the air that stirred up the hunger of the poor in Saint Antoine far away . 
 Clothing was the one unfailing charm that kept all things in place . Everyone was dressed for a fancy ball that would never stop , from the people at the palace of the Tuileries , to monseigneur and all of the court , to the judges' chambers and all of society . All , that is , except for the poor . Even the executioner was dressed for the ball . He , according to the style , performed his job dressed up , wearing makeup and a gold-laced coat , high heels , and white silk stockings . At the gallows and the wheel an execution method in which the prisoner's limbs were broken wheel the axe was rarely usedthe executioner wore fancy clothes . He was known as Mr . Paris by Mr . Orleans and his other fellow executioners . 
 And who , at the monseigneur's party in 1780 , could possibly doubt that a system based around a made-up , gold-laced , high-heeled , silk-stocking-wearing hangman wouldn't outlast the stars themselves ! Monseigneur had taken his chocolate from his four servants and eaten it , and he opened the doors of his inner chamber and came out . When he did , everyone started bowing , scraping , fawning , and generally humiliating themselves before him . Everyone did so much bowing and praying for the monseigneur that nothing was left for Heaven , which might have been one of several reason why the monseigneur's worshippers never went there . 
 As the monseigneur walked to the distant outer rooms , reaching the far region of the Circumference of Truth , he talked and smiled to his worshippers , promising something to one person or waving to another . Then he turned , came back , and eventually went back into his room with his servants . He wasn't seen again . After the monseigneur's show was over , the flutter of people and the ringing of their precious little bells faded and went downstairs . Soon there was only one person left in the crowd . He had his hat under his arm and his snuffbox in his hand , and he slowly walked past the mirrors on the wall on the way out . 
 With a loud rattle and clatter , the carriage rushed through the streets and around corners , disregarding the safety of others in a way that's difficult to understand now . Women screamed , and men grabbed each other and pulled children out of the way . Finally , as the carriage swooped around a street corner by a fountain , one of its wheels gave a sickening little bump . Several people cried out , and the horses reared up and halted . 
 If the horses hadn't stopped , the carriage probably would have kept going . Carriages often drove on and left behind whomever they had hurt . And why not ? But the frightened driver had gotten down quickly off the top of the coach , and ten people held the horses' bridles . What's wrong ? said the man inside . He calmly looked out of the carriage . A tall man wearing a nightcap had picked up a bundle from under the horses' feet and laid it on the base of the fountain . He was kneeling down in the wet mud , howling and crying like a wild animal . 
 Excuse me , monsieur the marquis ! said a meek man in ragged clothing . It is a child . Why is he howling like that ? Is it his child ? Excuse me , monsieur the marquis . It's a shame , but yes , it is . The fountain was a little set off from the street , for the street opened into a space of about ten or twelve square yards . The tall man suddenly got up from the ground and ran toward the carriage . Monsieur the marquis reached for the handle of his sword . He's been killed ! screamed the man , extending both arms over his head desperately . He's dead ! 
 The crowd gathered around and looked at monsieur the marquis . They only looked at him carefully and eagerly , without any menace or anger . No one said anything . After the first cry they had all stayed completely silent . The voice of the meek man was flat and tame with submission . The marquis looked at them all as if they were rats that had just come out of their holes . 
 The marquis took out his purse . I'm amazed that you people can't take care of yourselves and your children . One or another of you is always getting in the way . Who knows how badly you've hurt my horses ? Here ! Give him that . He tossed a gold coin on the ground for the driver to pick up , and everyone leaned forward to watch it as it fell . The tall man cried out again desperately , He's dead ! 
 Another man , for whom everyone else made way , arrived quickly and stopped him . On seeing this late comer , the meek man fell onto his shoulder , sobbing and crying and pointing to the fountain where some women were bent over the motionless bundle . They moved around it gently , completely silent , as were the men . I know , I know , said the man who had just arrived . Be brave , Gaspard ! It is better for the poor child to die this way than to live . It has died in an instant without suffering . Could it have lived one hour as happily ? 
 You are a philosopher , said the marquis , smiling . What is your name ? My name is Defarge . What is your job ? I sell wine , monsieur the marquis . Pick that up , you philosopher and seller of wine , said the marquis , throwing down another gold coin . Spend it however you like . Are the horses all right ? Without bothering to look at the crowd again , monsieur the marquis leaned back in his chair . As the carriage drove away the marquis had the look of a gentleman who has accidentally broken some small trifle and paid for it easily . His ease was disturbed when a coin flew into the carriage and landed on the floor . 
 Stop ! said monsieur the marquis . Stop the horses ! Who threw that ? He looked to where Defarge the wine seller had been standing a moment before . But instead he saw the poor father facedown on the pavement , crying there . The only person who stood beside him was a large , dark woman who was knitting . You dogs ! said the marquis smoothly , his face unchanged except for the corners of his nose . I would happily run any of you over and eliminate you like you were insects or vermin . If I knew which one of you rascals threw that coin into the carriage , and if that person was nearby , I would crush him under the wheels . 
 The people were so used to being subservient , and had so much bad experience that they knew what a man like the marquis could do to them , legally or otherwise , that no one said or did anything . None of the men even raised an eye . Only the woman who stood there knitting looked up steadily , and looked the marquis in the face . He was too dignified to even notice . His hate-filled eyes passed over her , and over the whole crowd of vermin . He leaned back in his seat again and yelled to the driver , Go on ! 
 The carriage drove on , and other carriages came speeding by after it . Ministers , state projectors , tax collectors , doctors , lawyers , churchmen , people from the Grand Opera and the Comedyall the people who had been at the monseigneur's dinnercame whirling by . The poorer people came creeping out of their homes to look at the accident . They stayed there for hours . Soldiers and policemen came between the people and the accident and formed a barrier that they slunk behind and peeped through . 
 The father had picked up his dead child and gone off with it long ago . The women who had cared for the child while it was lying at the base of the fountain sat there watching the water flowing in the fountain and the rich people drive by . All this time the one woman who was knitting stayed there , knitting as steadily as fate In Greek myth , one of the Fates spun a thread that represented each person's destiny fate . Soon everything was back to normal : The water ran in the fountain . The swift river ran . The day ran into evening . The life in the streets ran on quietly as it always does . The poor went back to sleeping in their cramped little homes . The rich people went to their fancy dinners , and all things ran their course . 
 The landscape was beautiful . The corn had a bright color , though there wasn't very much of it . Little patches of rye grew where corn should have been . Little patches of small peas and beans also grew there , and so did little patches of most of the cheap vegetables that can be used as substitutes for wheat . The plants , like the men and women who grew them , looked like they were growing unwillingly , like they wanted to give up and die . 
 Monsieur the marquis rode in his traveling carriage , which was loaded with unnecessary things . The carriage was conducted by four horses and two guards on horseback , all struggling up a steep hill . The marquis's face was blushing red , but not because he wasn't of good breeding . The redness didn't come from within but from an external source beyond his control : the sunset . The light from the sunset shone so strongly into the traveling carriage when it reached the top of the hill that the marquis was covered in a crimson light . The light will die out soon , said the marquis as he glanced at his hands . 
 The sun was so low that it set right at that moment . When they adjusted the brakes of the wheel , the carriage slid downhill . With the smell of fire , the red glow disappeared in a cloud of dust . The sun went down as the marquis went down the hill , and there was no glow left when they took the brake off the wheel . But the impoverished countryside was still there . A little village sat at the bottom of the hill . There was a church tower , a windmill , a forest for hunting , and a cliff with a castle on it that was used as a prison . All of these were growing darker as night came on . The marquis looked around at all these objects like someone who was returning home . 
 The village had one poor street with its one poor brewery , a poor tannery , a poor tavern , a poor stable yard for exchanging horses that delivered the mail , a poor fountain , and all the usual poor parts of a village . There were poor people there too . Everyone who lived in the village was poor , and many of them were sitting in their doorways shredding a few onions and other bits of food for supper . Many were at the fountain washing off leaves , grass , and anything from the ground that was edible . Small signs of their poverty were everywhere . They were taxed by the state , by the church , and by the lord . They paid both the local tax collector and the general tax collector , according to tradition . It was amazing there was any village left at all . 
 The marquis's arrival was announced by a messenger who had come ahead of him and by the sound of the horseman cracking his whip , which wrapped around the horses' heads like a snake in the night air . The marquis's traveling carriage pulled up in front of the posting-house gate . It was near the fountain , and the peasants stopped what they were doing to look at him . He looked back at them , and , although he didn't notice it , the peasants were all slowly and surely wasting away , this wasting being the reason that people in England would think of Frenchmen as small and thin for the next hundred years or so . 
 The marquis glanced over the faces of the peasants , and they bowed their heads before him the same way he had bowed his head in front of the monseigneur . The only difference was that these people were bowing because they were suffering , not because they wanted to appease him . Just then a gray old repairer of roads joined the crowd . Bring that man over to me ! said the marquis to the messenger . The man was brought to him . He had taken off his hat and held it in his hand , and the other men crowded around him to look and listen the way the people had at the fountain in Paris . 
 Did I pass you on the road ? Yes , Monseigneur . I had the honor of seeing you on the road . I saw you coming up the hill . And at the top of the hill ? It's true , Monseigneur . What were you looking at so intently ? Monseigneur , I was looking at the man . He bent down a little , and with his tattered blue cap he pointed under the carriage . Everyone around him bent over to look under the carriage . What man , you pig ? Why were you looking there ? Excuse me , Monseigneur , he was hanging onto the chain of the brake . Who ? asked the monseigneur . The man , Monseigneur . 
 Curse these idiots ! What was the man's name ? You know all the men in this part of the country . Who was he ? Have mercy on me , Monseigneur ! He was not from this part of the country . I'd never seen him before in my life . He was hanging onto the chain ? Was he trying to suffocate himself ? That was what was amazing about it , Monseigneur . If you'll permit me . His head was hanging overlike this ! He turned himself sideways to the carriage and leaned back . He faced up and his head was hanging down . Then he got back up , fumbled with his cap , and bowed . 
 What was the man like ? He was whiter than a miller , Monseigneur . He was covered in dust and white as a ghost . Tall as a ghost too ! The description produced an immense reaction in the crowd , but everyone kept looking at the marquis . They might have been looking to see if he had any ghosts on his conscience . Really , you did well to see a thief traveling under my carriage and not say anything , said the marquis sarcastically , aware that he shouldn't let poor people bother him . Bah ! Hold him , Monsieur Gabelle ! 
 Monsieur Gabelle was the postmaster and also a tax official . He had eagerly come out to help with the interrogation . He held the man being examined by his sleeve officially . Bah ! Go aside ! said Monsieur Gabelle . Arrest this stranger if he tries to stay in your village tonight . And make sure that his business is honest , Gabelle . I am happy to be of service , Monseigneur . 
 Did he run away , fellow ? Where did that accursed man go ? The accursed man was already under the carriage with six or so of his friends , pointing out the chain with his blue cap . Some six or so other people quickly pulled him out from under the carriage and brought him to the marquis . He was out of breath . Did the man run away , you dolt , when we stopped to apply the brake ? Monseigneur , he jumped over the side of the hill , headfirst , the way a person jumps into a river . Look into it , Gabelle . Then he yelled to the driver , Let's go ! 
 The six or so people who had been looking at the chain were still near the wheels . The wheels turned so quickly that they were lucky to get out of the way and to save their skin and bones . They were all very skinny , and there wasn't much else left of them , otherwise they might not have been so lucky . The carriage burst out of the village and headed toward a rise in the road . The hill was steep , though , and soon the carriage had slowed down to a walking pace . It swung and lumbered up the hill among the sweet scents of the summer night . The horsemen were surrounded by thousands of tiny gnats , and they lashed the horses with their whips . The valet walked beside the horses . The courier could be heard as he trotted ahead into the distance . 
 At the steepest part of the hill there was a little graveyard with a cross and a large figure of Jesus Christ on it . It was a rough wooden figure done by some amateur country sculptor . He must have based the figure on a person he knew , or perhaps on himself , for it was terribly small and thin . A woman was kneeling at the foot of this figure . She turned her head as the carriage came near her and quickly got up and went to stand at the carriage door . 
 It's you , Monseigneur ! I have a petition for you . He exclaimed impatiently but looked out at her . His expression didn't change . What ? What is it ? Always petitions ! Monseigneur , for the love of God ! My husband the foresterÖWhat about your husband the forester ? It's always the same with you people . He can't afford to pay for something ? He has paid all that he has , Monseigneur . He is dead . Good ! He's quiet . Can I bring him back to life for you ? Sadly , no , Monseigneur . But he is buried over there under a sad little heap of grass . 
 So ? Monseigneur , there are so many sad little heaps of grassÖAgain , so ? She looked like an old woman , but she was in fact young . She wrung her vein-covered , rough hands together with wild energy and placed one of them on the door of the carriage . She did it tenderly as if placing her hand on someone's chest , as if the carriage could feel her touch . Listen to me , Monseigneur . Listen to my petition ! My husband died of hunger . So many people do . So many more people will die from hunger . 
 Again , so ? Can I feed them all ? God knows that I'm not asking for that , Monseigneur . My petition is that a small bit of stone or wood with my husband's name be used to mark his grave . Otherwise his burial place will soon be forgotten . No one will find it after I die of hunger too . I will be buried under a different sad little heap of grass , Monseigneur . There are so many unmarked graves . People are dying faster and faster . There is so much hunger , Monseigneur . Monseigneur ! 
 The summer air was sweet all around him , and the same air surrounded the dusty , ragged , worn-out group of peasants at the fountain close by . The repairer of roads with the blue cap was still telling the story of the man under the carriage . As the crowd grew tired of the story , they walked away one by one . Lights started to shine in the little windows of the village , and the lights in the windows went out and more stars appeared . It looked as if the lights in the windows hadn't been put out but had shot up into the sky .
 The marquis's chateau was a massive , solid building . It had a large stone courtyard in front of it , and two stone staircases on either side led up to a stone terrace in front of the main door . The whole thing was made of stone . It had heavy stone railings and large stone flowerpots with stone flowers in them . There were men's faces and lion's heads carved out of stone decorating the building everywhere . It was as if a Gorgon a woman in Greek mythology with snakes for hair who turned people who looked at her into stone Gorgon had looked at the chateau when it had been built two hundred years ago and turned it all to stone . 
 The marquis got out of his carriage and went up the wide flight of short steps , and servants with torches went before him . The light cut through the darkness , causing an owl to hoot in the roof of a large stable that was off through the trees . Otherwise it was so quiet that the torches the servants carried on the steps and held at the front door sounded as if they were burning in a small stateroom instead of in the open night air . There was no other sound besides the hooting of the owl and the sound of water in a fountain falling into its stone basin . It was as if the night were holding its breath , sighing a long , low breath , and then holding its breath again . 
 The marquis avoided the larger rooms , which were dark and had been locked for the night . With his torchbearer going in front of him , he went up a staircase to a door in a hallway . The door led him to his own private three-room apartment , consisting of a bedroom and two other rooms . The rooms had high , vaulted ceilings and cold , bare floors . There were large dogs on the hearth where they would burn wood in the fireplace during the winter . The rooms had all the luxuries befitting a marquis at this luxurious time and place in history . The style of one of the last kings , Louis XIV of Francepart of a line of kings that thought for sure they would rule foreverwas known for its elegant furniture . But there were also many objects that referred to different periods in the history of France . 
 In the third room the servants set the dinner table for two . The room was round and was in one of the house's four towers , the tops of which looked like candle extinguishers . It was a small room , high up in the chateau . The window was wide open and the wooden shutters were closed . The darkness shone through the slats of the shutters and made dark horizontal lines on the stone floor . The marquis looked at the table settings . Is that for my nephew ? The servants said he hadn't arrived yet . He had not arrived , but he was expected . 
 Ah ! He probably won't arrive tonight . But leave the table as it is anyway . I will be ready for dinner in fifteen minutes . The monseigneur was ready for dinner in fifteen minutes , and he sat down alone to his extravagant dinner . His chair was on the opposite side from the window , and he was eating his soup . He was about to take a sip from a glass of Bordeaux wine when he suddenly put it down . What is that ? he asked calmly , looking at the horizontal lines of black on the stone floor . 
 What , Monseigneur ? That ? Outside the blinds . Open the blinds . The servant opened the blinds . Well ? It's nothing , Monseigneur . There's nothing outside but the trees and the darkness . The servant who had spoken had opened the blinds wide and had looked out into the empty night . He stood at the window with the darkness behind him , looking to the marquis for further instructions . Good , said the marquis calmly . Close the blinds again . The servant closed the blinds and the marquis went back to eating his supper . He had finished half of it when he stopped eating again with his glass of wine in his hands . He had heard the sound of wheels , and the sound grew closer and quickly came up to the front of the house . 
 Find out who has arrived . It was the monseigneur's nephew . He had been a few leagues a league is about three miles leagues behind the monseigneur early in the afternoon . He had been catching up to him quickly , but not quickly enough to arrive with him at the house . At the posting house he had been told that the monseigneur was ahead of him . The servants told the nephew that supper was waiting for him and that the monseigneur wanted him to join him . He came to supper shortly after he arrived . In England , the monseigneur's nephew was known as Charles Darnay . 
 The monseigneur was polite when he arrived , but they did not shake hands . You left Paris yesterday , sir ? he asked the monseigneur as he sat down at the table . Yes , yesterday . And you ? I came here directly . From London ? Yes . It took you a long time to get here , said the marquis , smiling . No . I came directly . Excuse me ! I didn't mean a long time in your journey . I meant a long time intending to come here . I have been delayed by the nephew paused various business . Without a doubt , said the marquis calmly . 
 While the servants were there , the two men did not speak . After coffee had been served and they were alone , the nephew looked at his uncle . He looked in his eyeshis uncle's face was like a fine maskand started up a conversation . As you guess , I have come back , sir , looking for the object that took me away in the first place . It put me in great and unexpected danger . But it is a sacred object , and even if it had led to my death , I hope it would have protected me . Don't say ëto death , ' said the uncle . It's not necessary to say ëto death . '
 I doubt , sir , that if it had carried me to the very brink of death , you would have stopped me there , answered the nephew . The expression on the marquis's face , and the dents in his nose , ominously suggested that was true . The uncle made a graceful gesture of protest , but it was so apparent that he was only being polite that it wasn't very reassuring . Indeed , sir , as far as I know , you may have arranged to make my already suspicious circumstances look even more suspicious . 
 No , no , no , said the uncle , pleasantly . But whether that's true or not , continued the nephew , looking at him suspiciously , I know that you would stop me any way you could , and use any means necessary . My friend , I told you that myself , said the uncle . The two dents in his nose pulsed quietly . Do me the favor of remembering that I told you that a long time ago . I remember that . Thank you , said the marquis , very sweetly . The tone of his voice stayed in the air like the tone of a musical instrument . 
 In effect , sir , continued the nephew . I believe that it is both your bad luck and my good luck that I am not in a prison in France right now . I don't quite understand , answered the uncle , sipping his coffee . Can you explain ? I believe that if you weren't out of favor with the court , and had not been for years , that a letter de cachet official documents that could be used to send someone to prison letter de cachet would have put me in prison indefinitely . It is possible that , for the sake of our family's honor , I might even decide to inconvenience you to that extent , said the uncle calmly . Please excuse me ! I see that , luckily for me , you were received coldly two days ago at the monseigneur's reception , as usual , said the nephew . 
 I wouldn't say luckily , my friend , answered the uncle politely . I would not be so sure of that . Some time alone in a prison cell to think things over might have a better influence on your future than you have on it yourself . But it is useless to talk about this . I am , as you have said , at a disadvantage . These little things we dosending people to prison , helping the power and honor of familiesthese slight advantages that might inconvenience you are only to be gotten by being insistent . 
 So many people want them , and so few get them ! It didn't used to be like this , but France has changed for the worse in such ways . Our ancestors , not long ago , held the right of life or death over the peasants and the poor . Many such dogs have been dragged out of this very room and hanged . In my bedroom next door , one man , as far as we know , was stabbed with a poniard a small dagger poniard for saying disrespectful things about his daughter . His own daughter ! We have lost many of our privileges . There is a new way of thinking today . And the power of our position , these days , mightI won't say that it definitely would , but it mightcause us real inconvenience . All of this is very bad for us ! 
 The marquis inhaled a pinch of snuff powdered tobacco that is sniffed up the nostrils snuff and shook his head . He was as elegantly unhappy as he could be with a country where he and his family still lived . We have used the power of our family's position , both in the old days and today , to such a degree , said Darnay unhappily , that I think our name is more hated that any name in France . Let's hope so , said the uncle . Hatred of the upper classes is the involuntary respect of the low classes . 
 There isn't a person anywhere in this country who looks at me with respect . They look at me with the fear and submission of slavery . That is a compliment to the magnificence of our family , earned by living a magnificent lifestyle . Hah ! The marquis laughed and inhaled another pinch of snuff . He crossed his legs daintily . The nephew leaned his elbow on the table and covered his face with his hands . The marquis glared at him sideways with a look of sharpness , familiarity , and dislike . The expression didn't match the attitude of indifference he pretended to have . 
 The only philosophy left is oppression ! The dark respect of fear and slavery , my friend , will keep the peasants in line as long as this roof blocks out the sky , he said , looking up at the ceiling . That might not be as long as the marquis thought . If someone had shown him a picture of his chateau a few years later , and a picture of fifty others like it , he might not have been able to tell his house from the other burned , destroyed wrecks . As far as the roof , he might have discovered it blocking out the sky in a new awayshutting it out from the sight of the people who were shot by the bullets of a hundred thousand muskets . 
 Meanwhile , said the marquis , I will preserve the honor and faith of our family , if you won't . But you must be tired . Should we end our meeting for the night ? One more minute . We can continue for another hour if you want . Sir , said the nephew , we have done wrong , and we are reaping the benefits of these wrongdoings . We have done wrong ? the marquis repeated with a questioning smile , delicately pointing at his nephew and then to himself . 
 Our family . Our honorable family , whose reputation is so very important to both of us , but in such different ways . Even during my father's generation , our family did many wrongs . We hurt every person who came between us and our pleasure , whatever it was . Why am I talking about my father's time when it is also your time ? You are my father's twin brother . You inherited as much as he did and succeeded as head of this family after he died . How can I separate you from him ? Death has separated us ! said the marquis . 
 And death has left me tied to a system that is dreadful to me . I am responsible for it but am also powerless in it . I am trying to following through on my mother's dying request and the look her in eyes , which begged me to have mercy and to make up for past wrongs . I am also tortured by looking for help and power and finding none . If you are looking for help from me , nephew , you will never find it , said the marquis . He touched Darnay's chest with his finger . They were now standing by the fireplace . 
 Every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face was mean and tight . He stood there , looking quietly at his nephew , with his snuffbox in his hand . He touched his nephew's chest with his finger again , as though his finger were the tip of a small sword that he delicately ran through his nephew's chest . He said , My friend , I will die preserving the system under which I have lived . 
 When he said it , he inhaled a pinch of snuff and put the snuffbox in his pocket . Better to be a rational creature , he added after ringing a small bell on the table , and accept your natural destiny . But I can see that you are lost , Monsieur Charles . Our family's property and all of this country are lost to me , said the nephew , sadly . I am giving them up . Are they both yours to give up ? France may be , but is our family's property ? It's hardly worth mentioning because it is so little , but is it yours yet ? I have no plan to claim it yet . If I inherited it from you tomorrow
 Which I hope , for my sake , is not likely , the marquis said . Or twenty years from nowYou're too kind , said the marquis . Still , I prefer the possibility that I may live that long . I would give it up and go live a different kind of life somewhere else . It isn't much to give up . It only brings me misery . Hah ! said the marquis , looking around his finely decorated room . The room is nice-looking enough . But to see it for what it really is , under the sky by daylight , it is a crumbling tower of wastefulness . It is poorly managed , and we are in debt . We have built our fortune on the oppression , starvation , and mistreatment of others . 
 Hah ! said the marquis again , in a well-satisfied manner . If I ever inherit it , it will be given to someone who is more qualified to put it back into good condition . This way , the poor peasants who are tied to this land and who have been abused for so long may , in another generation , suffer less . But I don't want it . There is a curse on this house and all of this land . 
 What about you ? asked the uncle . Forgive my curiosity , but with your new ideas , how do you plan on making a living ? I will do what other people here in France do , and what the nobility may someday have to do . I will work . In England , perhaps ? Yes . I will not tarnish the family name there . The family name can't harm me elsewhere , since I do not use it in other countries . When the marquis had rung the bell , his valet lit the bedroom next door . Bright light now shone from it through the doorway . The marquis looked that way and listened until he had heard his valet walk away . 
 You like England a lot . You have done well for yourself there , he said , smiling calmly at his nephew . I have told you already that I may be indebted to you , sir , for my success there . Otherwise , it has been a safe haven for me . Those bragging English say that it is a safe haven for many people . Do you know another Frenchman who has also found safety there ? A doctor ? Yes . With a daughter ? Yes . Yes , said the marquis . You are tired . Good night ! 
 As the marquis smiled and bowed , there was something suspicious in his face , and there was something mysterious about his last words . The nephew noticed this , and it bothered him . At the same time , the thin lines around the marquis's eyes , lips , and nose made his expression look handsome and evil . Yes , repeated the marquis . A doctor with a daughter . Yes . So begins the new way of thinking . You are tired . Good night ! 
 It would have been as useful to question the stone faces outside the chateau as it was to question the marquis's face . The nephew looked at him as he passed him on his way out the door , but he couldn't tell what he was thinking . Good night ! said the uncle . I look forward to seeing you again in the morning . Sleep well ! He called to the servants : Bring a torch and show my nephew to his room ! Then he muttered to himself , And burn him to death in his bed , if you will . He rang the little bell again and called his valet to his own bedroom . 
 After the valet had come and gone , the marquis paced back and forth in his loose robe to prepare himself for sleep on that hot , still night . He was wearing soft slippers on his feet and he moved around the room like an elegant tiger , making no noise at all . He looked like some magical marquis in a story who could change into a tiger , and was either just about to become a tiger or change back from a tiger into a man . 
 He walked from one end of his elegant bedroom to the other , thinking about what had happened to him that day . He thought of the carriage slowly climbing up the hill at sunset . He thought of the sun setting and the carriage traveling down the hill , of the mill , the prison on the rock , the little village in the valley , the peasants at the fountain , and the repairer of roads with his blue hat pointing out the chain under the carriage . The fountain reminded him of the fountain in Paris , and he though of the bundled-up child lying on the step , the women bending over it , and the tall man waving his arms in the air and yelling , Dead ! 
 I am cooler now and am ready to go to bed , said the marquis . He left only one candle burning on the hearth , and he pulled the thin gauze curtains around the bed . He heard the sound of the wind outside in the night as he settled down to sleep . The stone faces on the chateau's outer walls looked out at the night . It was quiet and dark for three long hours . For three long hours , the horses rattled in their stables , the dogs barked , and the owl made a noise that sounded very different from the sound poets say they make . But animals are often stubborn and don't often say the lines written for them . 
 For three hours , the stone faces of men and lions on the chateau stared out at the night . All of the land was dark , and the dust settled on the quiet roads . It was so dark that the little heaps of poor grass in the graveyard were indistinguishable from one another , and the figure on the crucifix might have come down , since it was practically invisible in the darkness . In the village , the tax collectors and the people who paid the taxes were fast asleep . They may have been dreaming of large feasts , as starving people usually do , or of resting and living easily , as overworked slaves and oxen do . The thin villagers slept soundly and , in their dreams , were fed well and were free . 
 It got lighter and lighter until sunlight hit the tops of the trees and light spread over the hill . In the sunlight , the water in the chateau fountain looked red as if the water were blood , and the faces of the stone statues were also red . The birds sang loudly , and one little bird sitting on the windowsill of the marquis's bedroom sang with all its might . The closest stone face nearest seemed to stare at the bird . Its mouth was open wide , making it appear amazed and awe stricken . 
 Finally the sun was up and people began to stir in the village . Windows were opened , doors were unlocked , and people came outside shivering , chilled by the sweet morning air . Then they began the hard work that would continue for all of them throughout the day . Some went to the fountain , and some went to work in the fields . Men and women went to dig and search for food . They went to tend to the meager livestock and to lead the skinny cows to any meager pastures they could find near the roadside . A couple of people were at the church kneeling and praying at the cross . A cow they had led there tried to eat the weeds at its feet . 
 The people at the marquis's chateau woke up later than the villagers , as was their habit , but they did gradually awake . First , the boar spears and hunting knives hanging in the hallway gleamed red in the sunlight . Then doors and windows were opened . The horses in their stables turned around to see light and fresh air coming in through the doorways . The iron-grated windows were opened , revealing the leaves outside rustling and sparkling . Dogs pulled at their chains impatiently , impatient to be let loose . 
 What winds told the repairer of roads about this frenzy ? He was already working on the hilltop past the village , with his small lunch lying in a small bundle on a pile of stones . Had the birds , carrying some grains while they flew , dropped the news to him the way they sowed seeds in the ground ? No matter how he knew , that morning the repairer of roads ran as if his life depended on it . He ran down the hill with dust covering his legs to his knees , and didn't stop until he got to the fountain . 
 Everyone from the village was at the fountain . They stood around in their depressed way and whispered quietly , showing no other emotions than morbid curiosity and surprise . The cows that were being led had been brought in and tied to anything that could hold them . They stood there looking on stupidly , or lying down and chewing cud that they had picked up while walking . Some of the people of the chateau , and some from the posting house , and all the tax collectors , carried weapons . They were gathered on the other side of the street not knowing what to do . 
 The repairer of roads had already pushed into a group of fifty friends and was hitting himself on the chest with his blue cap . What did all this mean ? What did it mean that they had lifted Monsieur Gabelle behind a servant on horseback and were carrying him away on the galloping horse , like a new version of the German ballad of Leonora ? It meant that there was one stone face too many up at the chateau . Someone was dead . 
 The Gorgon had looked at the building again that night and had turned one more face to stone . The building had been waiting for this particular stone face for two hundred years . The stone face was that of the marquis on his pillow . It looked like an elegant mask that had been suddenly frightened , made angry , and had then frozen that way . A knife had been plunged into his heart . There was a piece of paper tied to the handle . On it was written : Drive him quickly to his tomb . From Jacques . 
 A year had gone by , and Mr . Charles Darnay was settled in England . He taught the French language and also had knowledge of French literature . Today he would have been a professor , but back then he was a tutor . He taught young men who had the free time and interest to study another language that was spoken all over the world , and he developed a taste for its knowledge and stories . He could also translate them well into English and read them out loud in English . 
 People with such skills were hard to find at that time . Men who were once princes , and supposed to have become kings , hadn't been forced to work as teachers yet . No ruined nobility had gone broke , lost their accounts at Tellson's Bank , and become cooks and carpenters yet . Mr . Darnay soon developed a good reputation as a tutor who made his student's time particularly pleasant and beneficial , and as a graceful translator who brought something to his translations besides what you could find in a dictionary . He knew the situation in France well , and people in England were becoming more and more interested in it . By working tirelessly , he was able to make a good living . 
 He hadn't expected things to be easy for him in London . If he had , he wouldn't have done so well . He had expected hard work , and he found it . He did the work and made the best of it , and by doing this , his success continued . He spent a certain amount of time at Cambridge , where he taught undergraduates . The school tolerated him as he secretly taught European languages , instead of the official Greek and Latin . He spent the rest of his time in London . 
 He had been in love with Lucie Manette since he had been on trial for his life . He had never heard a sound so sweet and king as the sound of her voice . He had never seen anyone more beautiful than she had been when they met , when he was about to be executed . But he hadn't told her that he loved her yet . The murder at the empty chateau , over the water and the long , dusty roads far away , had happened a year ago , and now felt like it was part of a dream . Yet he still hadn't mentioned as much as a single word to her about his feelings . 
 He found the doctor reading in an armchair near the window . The energy that had supported him when he was a prisoner had gradually come back to him , and he was now a very energetic manvery driven and decisive . His energy sometimes came and went quickly , as had happened when he first recovered his other faculties , but this didn't happen too often and was happening less and less frequently . 
 He studied a lot , slept little , handled fatigue easily , and was usually cheerful . Charles Darnay now entered the room and went toward him . The doctor put his book down and held out his hand . Charles Darnay ! I'm happy to see you ! We have been expecting you for three or four days . Mr . Stryver and Sydney Carton were both here yesterday and both said you should have visited by now . I am thankful to them for their interest in me , he answered , a little indifferent about them but very kind to the doctor . Miss Manette
 Is doing well , the doctor continued . And your return will make us all happy . She is out on some household errands , but she will be home soon . Dr . Manette , I knew she wasn't at home . I took the opportunity of her being out to come speak to you . Dr . Manette was silent . Yes ? said the doctor , controlling himself . Bring your chair over here and tell me what it is . Mr . Darnay brought over the chair as he had been told , but he had trouble saying what he wanted to say . 
 I have been lucky , Dr . Manette , to spend the last year and a half enjoying the comfort of your home , he began after a long while . I hope what I'm about to say won'tThe doctor reached out his hand to stop him . After he had kept it there a little while , he drew back his hand and asked : Is Lucie what you want to talk about ? She is . It is hard for me to talk about her at any time . It is especially hard for me to hear you talk about her in that tone , Charles Darnay . It is a tone of great admiration , true respect , and deep love , Dr . Manette ! he said respectfully . 
 The doctor was silent again . Then he replied : I believe you . I trust you . I believe you . He was so restrained and so unwilling to talk about the subject that Charles Darnay hesitated . Shall I continue , sir ? The doctor was silent again . Yes . Continue . You know what I'm about to say . But you can't know how serious I am when I say it , and how much I feel it , without knowing my true thoughts and feelings and my deepest hopes and fears . Dr . Manette , I am in love with your daughter . I am devoted to her and think only of her well-being . If there was ever love in the world , I love her . You have been in love yourself . Think of the love you once had in your life when you think of me ! 
 The doctor sat facing away from him , with his eyes on the ground . After Mr . Darnay had said these last words , Dr . Manette stretched out his hand again quickly and said : Don't speak of that , sir ! Leave that alone ! I beg you , don't bring that up ! It sounded so much like he was actually crying out in pain that Charles Darnay's ears rang long after he had stopped . He gestured with the hand he had reached out toward him . He seemed to be asking Darnay to pause . Mr . Darnay stopped speaking . 
 I'm sorry , said the doctor quietly after a while . I don't doubt that you love Lucie . You should be happy about that . He turned toward him in his chair but continued to look at the ground . He rested his chin on his hand , and his white hair hung down over his face . Have you spoken to Lucie about this ? No . Or written to her about it ? Never . It would be rude to pretend not to know that you have kept yourself away from her out of respect for me . I thank you . He extended his hand but kept looking at the ground .  Her father sat in silence , facing the ground . His breathing had sped up a little , but otherwise he repressed any signs of being upset . 
 My dear Dr . Manette , having always known this , and always seeing the two of you together , I have restrained myself as long as humanly possible . I have felt , and even feel now , that to bring my love between you is to taint your past with something not quite as good as itself . But I love her . Heaven is my witness that I love her ! I believe you , her father answered sadly . I have thought so before now . I believe you . 
 The sadness in Dr . Manette's voice struck Darnay as a reproach . But do not believe that if I were ever lucky enough to make her my wife , that I would ever come between you . If that were so , I would never have told you what I am saying now , said Darnay . Besides the fact that I know it would be impossible , I know that it would be an awful thing to do . If I had any such plan , even for many years from now , or could ever consider such a thing , I wouldn't be able to shake your hand right now . 
 He placed his hand on the doctor's hand as he spoke . No , dear Dr . Manette . Like you , I left France by choice . Like you , I left to get away from the distractions , oppressions , and unhappiness . Like you , I worked to get away and live by my own hard work . I left in search of a better future , and I only want to share in your happiness , to share your life and home , and devote myself to you until death . I don't want to take Lucie away from you as your child and friend , but to tie her closer to you , if such a thing is possible . 
 He was still holding her father's hand . Her father responded by placing his hands on the arms of his chair . He looked up at him for the first time since their conversation had started , and it was obvious that he was struggling with something . He struggled with that dark look that would on occasion appear on his face . You speak so passionately , Charles Darnay , that I thank you with all my heart . I will open my heart to you , or nearly so . Do you have any reason to believe that Lucie loves you ? 
 None . So far , none . Are you hoping to find this out from this conversation ? Not at all . I might not have the courage to do it for weeks . I might have the courage to do it tomorrow , whether it's the right time to do it or not . Are you looking for advice from me ? I'm not asking for any , sir , but I have thought that you might have some to offer , if you thought it was right to do so . Are you hoping for a promise from me ? Yes , I am . What is it ? 
 I know that without you I have no hope . I understand that , even if Miss Manette loved me alreadydon't assume that I am conceited enough to think that she doesI could ever be loved by her if you didn't approve . If that is so , do you see what else is involved in it ? I also understand that if her father spoke in favor of any of her suitors that it would persuade her more than her own opinion or anything else in the world . For this reason , Dr . Manette said Darnay , I wouldn't ask you to do that if my life depended on it . 
 I'm sure of it . Charles Darnay , people who are close to each other still have secrets , just as people who are far apart . In the first case , those secrets are subtle , delicate , and hard to penetrate . In this way , Lucie is a mystery to me . I don't know how she feels about you . May I ask you , sir , if you think she is as he hesitated , the doctor finished the thought for him . Is being courted by another man ? That is what I meant . Her father thought awhile before he answered : You have seen Mr . Carton here . Mr . Stryver is here too , sometimes . If she is being courted , it would have to be by one of these two men . Or both of them , said Darnay . 
 I hadn't thought of that . I think it's more likely that it's neither of them . You want me to promise you something . Tell me what . Promise me that if Miss Manette ever tells you that she feels the same way about me as I do about her , you will tell her what I have said and that you believe me to be telling the truth . I hope you will think well enough of me as to not speak against me . I ask nothing more than that . Just tell me the conditions that you have , which you have a right to have . 
 I make the promise without any condition , said the doctor . I believe that what you said is true . I believe your intention is to make the bond between my daughter and me stronger , not weaker . If she ever tells me that she loves you , I will give her to you . If there wereCharles Darnay , if there wereMr . Darnay had taken his hand gratefully . They were holding hands when the doctor said : 
 any ideas , reasons , fears , anything at all , new or old against the man that she was in love withany wrongdoing that he was not directly responsible forI would forget them all for the sake of her happiness . She is everything to me . More to me than suffering , more to me than injusticeÖWell ! This is pointless talk . The way he had stopped speaking , and the way he was looking at him , was so strange that Darnay's hand turned cold under the doctor's touch . The doctor slowly let go of him . 
 You said something to me , said Dr . Manette , smiling . What was it you said to me ? He didn't know how to answer . Then he remembered that the doctor had spoken about there being a condition to his promise . Darnay was relieved to think of it , and answered : Your confidence in me should be returned with confidence in you . You may remember that the name I go by now , although it is only slightly changed from my mother's , is not my own . I want to tell you what my name really is and why I am in England . Stop ! said the doctor from Beauvais . 
 I want to tell you . So that you will trust me and I will have no secrets from you . Stop ! For a moment the doctor had covered his own ears with his hands , and a second later he had covered Darnay's mouth with them . Tell me when I ask you , not now . If you are successful and Lucie loves you , tell me the morning you get married . Do you promise ? Of course . Give me your hand . She will be home soon . It's better that she doesn't see us together tonight . Go ! God bless you ! 
 It was dark when Charles Darnay left , and it was darker an hour later when Lucie came home . She hurried into the room alone since Miss Pross had gone straight upstairs and was surprised to find the reading chair empty . Father ? she called to him . Father dear ? There was no answer , but she heard a faint hammering sound in his bedroom . She tiptoed into the next room and looked into his door and came running back , frightened and crying . What should I do ? What should I do ? 
 Her indecision only lasted a moment . She hurried back and knocked on his door , and she called out to him softly . The hammering stopped when she spoke , and he came out to her . They paced up and down together for a long time . She got out of bed and went to watch him sleep that night . He slept heavily , and his tray of shoemaking tools and his unfinished shoes were all laid out the way they always were . Mix another bowl of punch , Sydney , said Mr . Stryver to Mr . Carton that same night , or early in the morning . I have something to say to you . 
 Sydney Carton had been working twice as hard that night , and the night before . He had been working hard for many nights in a row , clearing out a lot of Mr . Stryver's papers before going on a long vacation . The papers had finally been cleared out , and Mr . Stryver's debts had been paid up . Everything was finished until November , when the weather would turn foggy , and legal matters would become complex and foggy too , and there would be work for him again . 
 Sydney wasn't very lively or very sober after working so hard . He had needed extra wet towels on his head to get him through the night . He had needed an extra amount of wine to drink before the towels . He was in bad shape . He pulled the towels off his head and threw them into the basin where he had been dipping them now and again for the last six hours . Are you mixing that other bowl of punch ? asked Stryver . He had his hands in his waistband , and he looked over from the sofa where he was lying on his back . I am . 
 Now look here ! I'm going to tell you something that will surprise you . It might make you think that I'm not as smart as you think I am . I plan on getting married . Do you ? Yes . And I'm not even marrying for money . What do you say to that ? I don't have much to say . Who is she ? Guess . Do I know her ? Guess . It's five o'clock in the morning ! I'm not going to guess . I'm too tired . If you want me to guess you'll have to ask me at lunch . 
 In that case I'll tell you , said Stryver . He sat up slowly . Sydney , I have trouble explaining myself to you because you're an insensitive idiot . And you , returned Sydney sarcastically , who was busy mixing the punch , are such a sensitive and poetic spiritCome on ! Stryver replied , laughing arrogantly . I don't claim to be a romantic . I hope I know better than to be that . But I am more sensitive than you are . 
 You're luckier , you mean . That's not what I mean . I mean I am a man of moremoreSay ëchivalry' while you're at it , suggested Carton . Good ! I'll say chivalry . What I mean is that I am a man who cares more about being attractive to women than you do . I work harder at it and I'm better at it , said Stryver . He puffed up his chest as Carton mixed the punch . Go on , said Sydney Carton . 
 No . But before I go on , said Stryver , shaking his head in his bullying way , I'll prove my point . You've been to Dr . Manette's house as often as I have , perhaps even more . I've been embarrassed by how depressed you act there ! You behave in a such silent and sullen and downcast way that I am embarrassed by you , Sydney ! It is good for a lawyer to be ashamed about something , answered Sydney . You should thank me . 
 You won't get off that easy , answered Stryver , shoving the response at him . No , Sydney , it's my duty to tell you . I'm telling you to your face to help you . You aren't suited for that kind of company . You are an unpleasant man . Sydney drank a large glass of the punch he had made and laughed . Look at me ! said Stryver , turning toward him . I don't need put in any effort to make myself attractive like you do . I am more independent than you are . I make a lot of money and have a good position . So why do I do it ? 
 I've never seen you do it yet , Carton muttered to himself . I do it because it's smart to do it . I do it on principle . And look at me ! I do well for myself . You aren't doing well with your story about your plans to marry , answered Carton casually . I wish you would stay on the subject . And back to medon't you understand that I am hopeless ? He looked angry when he asked the question . You have no business being hopeless , answered Stryver harshly . I have no business being anything as far as I know , said Sydney Carton . Who is the lady ? 
 Now don't get uncomfortable when I tell you who it is , Sydney , said Mr . Stryver in a falsely friendly way . I know you don't mean half of the things you say . And even if you meant all of it , it wouldn't matter to me . I'm saying this because you mentioned the young lady to me in a negative way . I did ? You did . Right here in this apartment . Sydney Carton looked at his punch , and he looked at his satisfied friend . He drank his punch and looked at his friend again . 
 You called her a golden-haired doll . The young lady is Miss Manette . If you were someone who had any sensitivity or compassion in that way , Sydney , I might have been unhappy about what you said . But you aren't . You have no sense at all . Therefore I am no more upset by what you said than I would be if a man who knows nothing about art criticized one of my paintings . Or if a man who knows nothing about music criticized a piece I had written . Sydney Carton drank his punch quickly . He drank it by the glassful . He kept looking at Stryver . 
 Now you know all about it , Syd , said Mr . Stryver . I don't care about money . She is a charming woman , and I have decided to make myself happy . Overall I think I can afford to be happy . I will be a husband who is already somewhat wealthy , and I am doing better and better for myself . I have some respect . It is lucky for her , but she deserves good luck . Are you surprised ? Carton , still drinking his punch , answered Why should I be surprised ? Do you approve ? Carton was still drinking his punch . Why shouldn't I approve ? 
 Well ! said Carton's friend Stryver , you're taking it better than I thought you would . And you aren't as protective of me as I would have thought . Though you know pretty well that your old friend is pretty strong willed . Yes , Sydney , I am tired of continuing this lifestyle . I think it's nice for a man to have a home to go back to when he wants to (when he doesn't , he can always stay away) . I feel that Miss Manette will be presentable in any company and will make me look good . So I have decided to marry her . And now , Sydney , old friend , I want to say something to you about your hopes . You are doing poorly for yourself , I know . You really are . 
 Now , let me suggest , continued Stryver , that you face the reality of your future . I have faced it in a different way . You should face it in your own way . Get married . Find someone to take care of you . Forget that you don't enjoy spending time with women , or understand them , or want to get married . Find someone . Find a respectable woman who has a little property . Find some landlady or hotelkeeper and marry her , in case your health goes . That's what you need to do . Think about it , Sydney .  I'll think about it , said Sydney . 
 Mr . Stryver , having made up his mind to be nice enough to marry Lucie Manette , decided to give her the good news before he left town on his long vacation . After thinking it over for a while he decided that it would be best to ask her right away and get it over with . Then they could take their time deciding whether they should get married a week or two before Michaelmas term sometime in late October Michaelmas term or during the Christmas vacation between Michaelmas and Hilary term between November 25 and January 11 Hilary term . 
 He had no doubt that she would want to marry him and was sure she would say yes . He thought of it as a court case . If he argued his case in practical termsthe only terms worth consideringit was a clear case without any weaknesses . He called himself as a witness for the plaintiff . His evidence was unbeatable . The counsel for the defendant gave up his case , and the jury didn't even need to stop to discuss their verdict . After trying the case , Mr . Stryver , Chief Justice , knew that it was an open-and-shut case . 
 Accordingly , Mr . Stryver decided to begin his long vacation with a formal offer to take Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens . If that didn't work , he would take her to Ranelagh . If that failed too , he would go to her house in Soho and tell her how he felt about her there .  Mr . Stryver shoved his way through the streets from Temple Bar toward Soho at the beginning of his long vacation . As he headed toward Soho , while he was still on Saint Dunstan's side of Temple Bar , he rushed in his all-out way along the sidewalk , shoving aside all weaker people . Anybody who had seen him would have noticed how invulnerable and strong he was . 
 His path took him past Tellson's Bank , and since he did his banking at Tellson's and knew that Mr . Lorry was a close friend of the Manettes , he decided to go in and tell Mr . Lorry about his plans to propose to Miss Manette . He pushed open the creaky door and stumbled down the two steps leading into the bank and walked past the two old cashiers . He shoved his way into the small , dirty back office where Mr . Lorry sat . In front of him were large books with lined columns of numbers in them . There were horizontal iron bars on his window , as if the window had been ruled for crunching numbers too , and everything under the clouds were a math problem . 
 Hello ! said Mr . Stryver . How do you do ? I hope you are well ! Mr . Stryver's oddest characteristic was that he always appeared too big for whatever space he was in . He seemed so large in Tellson's that old clerks in far corners looked up in protest as though he were squeezing them against the wall . The head of the bank , reading a paper far away , lowered it unhappily , as if Mr . Stryver had head-butted him in the stomach . 
 Mr . Lorry said in a quiet , professional tone , How do you do , Mr . Stryver ? How do you do , sir ? He shook Mr . Stryver's hand . There was a strangeness in the way Mr . Lorry shook hands . All the clerks at Tellson's shook hands this way when the head of the bank was there . He shook hands in an impersonal way , as if he were shaking hands on behalf of the whole company . Can I do anything for you , Mr . Stryver ? asked Mr . Lorry in a professional way . Why , no , thank you . This is a personal visit , Mr . Lorry . I have come to have a word with you in private . 
 Oh , really ? said Mr . Lorry . He leaned down so that he could hear him but kept looking at the head of the bank far away . I am going , said Mr . Stryver , leaning on the desk . When he did , although the desk was very large , it looked as though there weren't even half enough desk for him . I am going to ask your friend , Miss Manette , to marry me , Mr . Lorry . Oh dear me ! yelled Mr . Lorry , rubbing his chin and looking at Mr . Stryver doubtfully . Oh , dear me , ' sir ? repeated Stryver , pulling away . Oh , dear you , sir ? What do you mean , Mr . Lorry ? 
 I mean it in a friendly way , answered Mr . Lorry professionally . It speaks well for you , and , in short , I wish you everything you desire . But really , you know , Mr . Stryver Mr . Lorry paused . He shook his head at him strangely , as if he couldn't help thinking , You know , you are just too large ! Well ! said Stryver , slapping the desk with his hand , opening his eyes wide , and taking a deep breath . If I understand what you're saying , Mr . Lorry , then you think she will not accept ! 
 Mr . Lorry adjusted his little wig at his ears and bit the feather tip of his quill pen . Damn it all , sir ! said Stryver . He looked at him intensely . Aren't I good enough to marry her ? Oh , dear , yes ! Yes , you're good enough ! said Mr . Lorry . If the question is if you're good enough , then yes , you're good enough . Aren't I successful ? asked Stryver . Oh ! If you're asking if you are successful , then yes . You are successful , said Mr . Lorry . And aren't I becoming more successful ? If the question is if you're becoming more successful , then no one can doubt that , said Mr . Lorry , who was thrilled to be able to agree with him . Then what on earth do you mean , Mr . Lorry ? asked Mr . Stryver , visibly hurt . 
 Well ! Iwere you on your way to Miss Manette's house right now ? asked Mr . Lorry . I'm going straight there ! said Stryver , with a thump of his fat fist on the desk . I think I wouldn't do that if I were you . Why not ? asked Stryver . Now I want to know the truth from you . He pointed his finger at him and shook it . You are a businessman and you must have a reason . Tell me your reason . Why wouldn't you go ? Because I wouldn't do such a thing unless I had some reason to think that I would succeed , said Mr . Lorry . Damn me ! yelled Stryver . Doesn't that beat all ! 
 Mr . Lorry looked at the head banker in the corner and looked back at Mr . Stryver , who was now angry . You are a businessman . You are old and experienced . You work in a bank , said Mr . Stryver . And just having told you three good reasons why I should succeed , you say there is no reason at all ! You say it with your head on your shoulders ! Mr . Stryver commented on it as if it would have been less surprising if he had said it with his head off his shoulders . 
 When I talk about success , I'm talking about success with the young lady . And when I talk about reasons why you would be likely to succeed , I talk about reasons that would persuade the young lady . The young lady , my good sir , said Mr . Lorry tapping Stryver gently on the arm , The young lady's happiness is the most important thing . Then what you're telling me , Mr . Lorry , said Stryver turning toward him , is that you think Miss Manette is an idiot ? 
 Not exactly . What I mean , Mr . Stryver , said Mr . Lorry , who was turning red in the face , is that I will not let anyone speak badly of Miss Manette . If I knew any manand I hope I do notwho had such poor taste and such a bad temper that he couldn't keep himself from speaking badly of Miss Manette here at my desk , even the fact that we are in Tellson's Bank wouldn't stop me from telling him off . 
 The fact that Mr . Stryver was so angry but had to keep his voice down made his veins stand out . Mr . Lorry's veins , as calm as they usually were , were just as bad now that it was his turn to speak . That is what I'm trying to tell you , sir , said Mr . Lorry . Let's be clear about that . Mr . Stryver sucked on the end of a ruler for a little while , then stood tapping the ruler against his teeth , which probably gave him a toothache . He broke the awkward silence by saying : This is strange to me , Mr . Lorry . You are telling me not to go to Miss Manette's house in Soho and offer myself to her . Me ! Stryver , the successful lawyer of the King's Bench bar ? 
 Are you asking me for advice , Mr . Stryver ? Yes , I am . Very good . Then I have given you my advice and you have repeated it correctly . All I can say to that , laughed Stryver , who was clearly annoyed , is that thisha , ha ! This beats everything ! Now understand , continued Mr . Lorry . As a businessman , I am not qualified to say anything about this . As a businessman , I know nothing about love and marriage . But as an old man who carried Miss Manette in his arms when she was a baby , and as a trusted friend of Miss Manette and of her father who cares very much for both of them , I have spoken . Remember , I did not come to you with this advice . You came to me . Now , do you think I might be wrong ? 
 Not I ! said Stryver , whistling . I can't seem to find third parties with common sense . I can only find it in myself . I believe I have sense in certain matters . You believe nonsense . It's new to me , but I think you might be right . I believe what I believe , Mr . Stryver . And understand , sir , said Mr . Lorry , quickly turning red again , I will notnot even in Tellson's Bankhave another man alive criticize me for it . I beg your pardon ! said Stryver . 
 Then I give you my pardon . Thank you . Well , Mr . Stryver , I was about to say that it might hurt to realize that you are wrong . It might hurt Dr . Manette to have to explain it to you . It might hurt Miss Manette very much to have to explain it to you . You know that I am lucky enough to have a close relationship with the family . If you don't mind , without committing you or representing you in any way , I will try to gather some more information and judge its meaning so I can give you the best advice . If you then disagree with my advice , you can try it out for yourself . If , on the other hand , you agree with it , it might spare everyone a lot of trouble . What do you say ? 
 How long would I have to stay in town ? Oh ! Only a few hours . I could go to the Manette's house in Soho tonight and come to your apartment afterward . Then I agree , said Stryver . I won't go there now . I'm not so anxious that I need to do that . I agree and I will wait for you to go there tonight . Good day . Then Mr . Stryver turned away and charged out of Tellson's Bank . He caused such a forceful breeze to follow him that it almost knocked over the two old clerks . 
 The two old men were always bowing to the customers on their way out , and many people believed that after they had bowed a customer out , they just kept bowing in the empty office until another customer came in and brought them back upright . Mr . Stryver was smart enough to realize that the banker wouldn't have said so much about his opinion unless he were sure of it . As unprepared as he was to receive Mr . Lorry's unwanted advice , he followed it . And now , said Mr . Stryver , pointing his finger and shaking it at all of Temple Bar , my way out of this is to prove you're all wrong . 
 He soothed himself with a trick used by lawyers at the Old Bailey . You won't prove me wrong , Miss Manette , said Mr . Stryver . I'll prove myself wrong . So , when Mr . Lorry came to Mr . Stryver's place at ten o'clock that night , Mr . Stryver had surrounded himself with piles of books and papers . He seemed to have no interest in their conversation from the morning . He even acted surprised when he saw Mr . Lorry and pretended to be preoccupied and distracted . 
 Well ! said Mr . Lorry pleasantly , after spending half an hour trying unsuccessfully to get Mr . Stryver to bring up the subject . I have been to Soho . To Soho ? repeated Mr . Stryver indifferently . Oh , yes , of course ! What was I thinking ? And I'm sure , said Mr . lorry , that I was right when we talked this morning . My opinion has been confirmed , and I repeat the same advice to you . I'm sorry for your sake and sorry for her father's sake , said Mr . Stryver in his friendliest way . I know this must be a difficult subject for the family . Let's not talk about it again . 
 I don't understand you , said Mr . Lorry . Apparently not , he answered , nodding his head . It doesn't matter . But it does matter , Mr . Lorry said . No it doesn't . I promise you it doesn't . I had thought that Miss Manette was a sensible , ambitious woman . I was mistaken . But there is no harm done . Young women have made similar mistakes many times before and have been sorry for them when they ended up poor and forgotten .
 In an unselfish way , I am sorry that the marriage is not happening because it would have been bad for me from a practical point of view . In a selfish way , I am glad that it's not happening , because it would have been bad for me from a practical point of view . It's obvious that I wouldn't have gained anything by it . There is no harm done . I haven't proposed to Miss Manette , and , just between you and me , I am not sure , now that I think about it , that I should have even thought about it . 
 Mr . Lorry , you can't control the changing fancies of empty-headed girls . You can't expect to , or you will always be disappointed . Now , please , let's not talk about it anymore . I tell you , I'm sorry about it for their sake , but I am happy about it for my own sake . I am grateful to you for letting me talk to you about it and for giving me your advice . You know Miss Manette better than I do . You were right . It never would have worked . 
 Mr . Lorry was so surprised that he stared blankly at Mr . Stryver as Mr . Stryver shoved him toward the front door and pretended to be in a good mood . Make the best of it , my dear sir , said Stryver . Let's talk no more about it . Thanks again for allowing me to talk to get your opinion . Good night ! Mr . Lorry was standing outside in the darkness before he knew where he was , and Mr . Stryver was lying on his sofa , blinking at the ceiling . 
 If Sydney Carton ever made a good impression anywhere , it was certainly never at Dr . Manette's house . He had been going there regularly for a whole year , and he always spent his time there lying around in a grumpy mood . When he said anything , he spoke well , but his apathy cast a shadow over him , and his good heart rarely shined through . He did , however , like the streets that surrounded the Manettes' house , and the cobblestones that made them up . 
 Many nights he would end up wandering sadly around their neighborhood , after drinking wine all night had failed to improve his mood . Many times he would be wandering near their house at sunrise , and often he would still be there when the first rays of sun hit the church steeple and tall buildings . Perhaps these quiet mornings made him think happy thoughts that he forgot about at other times during the day . Lately , he had spent less time than ever in his unmade bed at Temple Court . Often , after he had come home and thrown himself on it for just a few minutes , he would get up again and wander around the Manettes' neighborhood . 
 One day in August , when Mr . Stryver (after telling Mr . Carton that he had decided not to get married) had gone to Devonshire , Mr . Carton wandered around near the Manette's house . The sight and smell of flowers in the city gave a sense of goodness to even the worst people , a feeling of health to the sickliest , and an air of youth to the oldest . At first Mr . Carton wandered aimlessly . Then he was struck by an idea . He walked purposefully to Dr . Manette's door . 
 The servant brought him upstairs and he found Lucie working there alone . She had never been comfortable when he was around , and she was a little embarrassed when he arrived and sat down near her at her table . She looked at his face after they exchanged a few pleasantries and noticed that something was different about him . You look sick , Mr . Carton ! No . But I live an unhealthy lifestyle , Miss Manette . What can you expect from someone as decadent as I am ? Forgive me for asking , but wouldn't it be better to live a better life ? 
 God knows it's a shame that I don't ! Then why not change the way you live ? She looked at him gently again , surprised and sad to see that he was crying . His voice sounded sad , too , as he answered : It's too late for that . I will never be better than I am now . I'll only get worse and worse . He leaned his elbow on the table and covered his eyes with his hand . The table trembled as he cried on it silently . She had never seen him so vulnerable , and it was upsetting to her . He could tell that she was upset , so without looking at her , he said : Please forgive me , Miss Manette . I'm crying because of what I'm about to say to you . Will you listen to me ? 
 If it will make you happy , Mr . Carton , I would be glad to . God bless you for being so kind . After a little while he removed his hand from his face , and he spoke steadily . Don't be afraid to listen to me . Don't pull away from what I say . I am like someone who has died young . My whole life is a missed opportunity . No , Mr . Carton . I bet the best is still to come . I'm sure that you might make yourself proud . That's nice of you to say , Miss Manette . And although I know it isn't true , I will never forget it . 
 She was pale and shaking , and he tried to soothe her . He was filled with a misery and self-loathing that made the conversation unlike any other . I am a wasteful , drunken , poor , abused creature . If it had been possible for you to love me , Miss Manette , I would have known that , although I was happy , I would only make you unhappy . I would bring you sorrow and regret . I would disgrace you and bring you down with me . I know that you have no feelings for me , and I don't ask you to . I am even happy that you don't . 
 Can't I help you , even though I don't love you , Mr . Carton ? Forgive me , but can't I help you put your life on a better path ? Can't I repay your trust in me ? I know you are putting trust in me by telling me this , she said modestly after hesitating a bit , with genuine tears . I know that you wouldn't tell anyone else this . Can't I turn this into something that will help you , Mr . Carton ? He shook his head . You can't help me at all . No , Miss Manette . If you will listen to me a little while longer , you will have done everything you could do for me . 
 I want you to know that you have been my last hope . I haven't been so lost that the sight of you with your father , and of this house that you've made into a home , has made me remember things that I thought I had forgotten forever . Since I've known you , I have been bothered by a remorse that I thought would never bother me again . I have heard voices encouraging me to be better that I thought had disappeared forever . I have had vague thoughts about starting over again . I have imagined myself giving up laziness and sin and fighting for what's right in the world . It's all a dream , of course , that won't amount to anything . But I want you to know that you inspired me to have these thoughts . 
 Nothing will come of it ? Oh , Mr . Carton , think about it again ! Try to start over ! No , Miss Manette . All this time I have known that I do not deserve it . And yet I have been weak enough , and still am weak enough , to want you to know how you took me , a poor , broken man , and made me want to be a better man . But still , I will only waste away and amount to nothing . Since I have caused you to be more unhappy than you were before you knew me , Mr . Carton
 Don't say that , Miss Manette . If anyone could have saved me , it would have been you . You will not be the reason I get worse . Since the condition that you have described is partly my faultthat's what you mean , if I can say it plainlycan't I be of service to you ? Am I not able to help you at all ? The most good that I can do now , Miss Manette , is why I have come here . Let me live the rest of my wasteful life knowing that I told you my feelings and that there was still something left in me now worth pitying . 
 I beg you again and again to believe that you are able to do better things with your life , Mr . Carton ! Don't beg me to believe it anymore , Miss Manette . I know what I am . I'm upsetting you , so I will finish what I have to say . Will you let me believe , when I remember this day , that I told you the last secret of my life and that you kept it ? And that no one will ever know about it ? If that will bring you comfort , yes . Not even the person you love the most ? 
 Mr . Carton , she answered after pausing nervously , it's your secret , not mine . I promise to respect that and to tell no one . Thank you . And again , God bless you . He kissed her hand and walked toward the door . Don't worry . I will never continue this conversation with you again , Miss Manette . I will never mention it . That couldn't be more certain than if I were dead . When I die , I will cherish my one good memory . I shall thank and bless you for the fact that the last good words I spoke about myself were spoken to you . And that my name , my faults , and my cares were told to you . Otherwise I hope you are happy and carefree ! 
 He was acting so unlike he ever had before , and it was so sad to think about what he threw away with his wasted and debauched life , that Lucie Manette cried for him . He stood there looking at her . Take comfort ! he said . I am not worth crying over , Miss Manette . An hour or two from now , when I join my lowlife friends and their sinful habits , I will be less worth your tears than any poor wretch on the streets . Take comfort ! But in my heart , when I think of you , I will always be the man I am now , although on the outside I will be the man you have always known me to be . My last request is that you will believe this . 
 I will , Mr . Carton . I will leave soon , freeing you from me . You and I have nothing in common , and there is a wide gap between us . But this is my last request . It is useless to say it , I know , but I can't help myself . I would do anything for you or the people you care about . If I were capable of making a sacrifice for you , I would sacrifice anything for you or the people you love . 
 Think of me now and again , in quiet times , and know that I mean what I say . Sometime soon you will get married and have a family . Oh , Miss Manette , when you look down one day and see the resemblance of your husband's face in your child smiling up at you , or when you see a beautiful little girl like yourself at your feet , remember now and then that there is a man who would die to keep someone you love beside you . 
 He said a final Farewell , God bless you ! and left . Mr . Jeremiah Cruncher saw many different things move past him as he sat on his stool on Fleet Street , with his grubby little son beside him . Who could sit on Fleet Street during the busy hours of the day and not be overwhelmed by the noise and sight of the two great streams of people going about their day ? One was always heading west , and the other always heading east . Both were always heading toward the valleys past where the sun sets . 
 Mr . Cruncher sat watching the two streams with a straw in his mouth , looking like a country farmer who has sat for hundreds of years keeping watch over one stream . Jerry , though , didn't expect that the stream would ever dry up . He wouldn't want it to dry up , since a small amount of his income came from helping timid , well-dressed older women cross from Tellson Bank's side of the street to the other side . 
 As short as these encounters were , Mr . Cruncher always became so friendly with these women that he would tell them that he wanted to drink to their health . They gave him money to do just that , adding to his income . There was a time when a poet might sit on a stool in public and contemplate the men he saw . Mr . Cruncher , sitting on his stool in public , wasn't a poet . He thought as little as possible and just looked around . 
 He happened to be sitting and staring at a time when there weren't many people out , so there were very few women to help across the street . He was doing so poorly that he started to suspect that his wife must have been praying against him . Just then an unusual group came hurrying down Fleet Street heading west . Mr . Cruncher looked their way and could see some kind of funeral moving along . He could tell that people were angry about it . 
 Young Jerry , said Mr . Cruncher , turning to his son . It's a funeral . Hooray , Father ! cried Young Jerry . The boy yelled his cheer with mysterious significance . His father was so upset by his cheer that he waited until no one was looking and then smacked the boy on the ear . What do you mean ? What are you hooraying at ? What are you trying to tell your father , you young punk ? This boy is too much for me ! said Mr . Cruncher , looking at his son . Him and his hoorays ! Don't let me hear any more out of you or I'll hit you again . Do you hear me ? I wasn't doing anything wrong , protested Young Jerry , rubbing his cheek . 
 Stop it then , said Mr . Cruncher . I don't want to hear you say you did nothing wrong . Get up on that stool and look at the crowd . His son obeyed , and the crowd came closer . They were crying and wailing around a dingy hearse and a dingy funeral coach . There was only one mourner in the funeral coach . He was dressed in the dingy mourning clothes considered appropriate for the situation . He didn't seem happy to be there , though , as the mob was growing larger around the coach . They were making fun of him and making faces at him . They kept yelling out , Yah ! Spies ! Tst ! Yaha ! Spies ! with many other insults too offensive to repeat . 
 Mr . Cruncher always liked funerals . He always paid close attention to them and got excited when a funeral went past Tellson's Bank . Naturally , therefore , he was especially excited about a funeral with such an unusual crowd following it . He asked the first man who ran into him : What's happening , my friend ? What's it all about ? I don't know , said the man . The man went back to yelling at the coach , Spies ! Yaha ! Tst ! Spies ! He asked another man . Who is it ? I don't know , answered the other man . Still , he cupped his hands around his mouth and loudly shouted , Spies ! Yaha ! Tst , tst ! Spiies ! 
 After a while , a person with more information ran into him . This person told Mr . Cruncher that the funeral was of a man named Roger Cly . Was he a spy ? asked Mr . Cruncher . He was an Old Bailey spy , answered the man . He went on yelling at the coach , Yaha ! Tst ! Yah ! Old Bailey spiiies ! Why , of course ! said Jerry , remembering the trial he had helped with . I've seen him . Is he dead ? Dead as mutton meat from a sheep mutton , answered the other man . And he can't be too dead . Have 'em out ! Spies ! Pull them out ! Spies ! 
 The mob thought that this was a good idea , since it was the only idea anyone had suggested . They all started repeating the man's suggestion to have 'em out and pull 'em out . They pushed so close to the two vehicles that they came to a stop . Once the crowd opened the doors of the coach , the one mourner came out by himself and was taken by the crowd for a moment . He was so quick , though , that a moment later he had gotten away from them and was running down a side street after slipping out of his coat , hat , long hat band , white handkerchief , and other symbols of mourning . 
 The crowd tore his clothes to pieces and threw them around happily . The shopkeepers nearby quickly closed up their shops , for in those days mobs stopped at nothing and could cause a lot of destruction . They had already gone so far as to open the hearse to take the coffin out when some genius suggested instead that they bring it to its destination while they celebrate the death . Since there weren't many good ideas being suggested , this too was accepted happily by the mob . Immediately , the coach was filled with eight people inside and twelve outside , while as many people as could fit climbed onto the roof . 
 The undertakers in charge complained about this takeover of the funeral procession . The river , however , was dangerously close by , and several members of the crowd mentioned how effective a dunking in cold water could be in getting stubborn officials to change their minds . The undertakers didn't complain too much after that . The new procession started with a chimneysweep driving the hearse , with the regular driver sitting beside him and directing him . The pie maker , aided by his cabinet minister , drove the mourning coach .
 Thus the procession continued down the street , with the crowd drinking beer , smoking pipes , singing songs , and some people doing mocking impressions of people in mourning . More and more people joined the mob as it went , and all the shops closed as it approached . It was heading for the old church of Saint Pancras , far off in the country . Eventually it arrived there , and the crowd insisted on all going into the burial ground . There they finally buried the dead Roger Cly as they wanted , and to their great satisfaction . 
 With the dead man buried , and the crowd needing some other entertainment for itself , another genius (or perhaps the same one) had the idea of accusing unsuspecting passers-by of being Old Bailey spies and harassing them . The mob chased down dozens of innocent people who had never even been near the Old Bailey in their lives and knocked them around and abused them . The transition to breaking windows and robbing pubs came easily and naturally . Finally , after several hours , when several summerhouses had been pulled down and some fences had been broken and used as weapons by some of the more violent people , a rumor started that the Guards were coming . 
 As the rumor spread , the crowd started to disperse . The Guards may or may not have actually ever come , but this is how mobs usually ended . Mr . Cruncher didn't take part in the final events , but had stayed at the churchyard to talk with the undertakers . The churchyard was calming to him . He got a pipe from a nearby pub and smoked it as he looked at the fences and thoughtfully considered the graveyard . Jerry , said Mr . Cruncher , talking to himself in his usual way . You saw that Cly man that day at the Old Bailey . You saw with your own eyes that he was a young , respectable-looking man . 
 He finished his pipe and thought to himself awhile longer . Then he turned around and headed back so that he would be seen at his place outside of Tellson's Bank at closing time . Whether his thoughts on death had made him feel sick , or whether he had been feeling unhealthy before that , or whether he wanted to pay a visit to an important man doesn't matter . What matters is that he made a short visit to his doctor , a respected surgeon , on his way back . 
 Young Jerry had covered for his father in his absence and told him that there had been no work while he was gone . The bank closed , the old clerks came out , the watchmen took their place , and Mr . Cruncher and his son went home to tea . I tell you , now , Mr . Cruncher told his wife as he came in , if , as an honest businessman , my plans go wrong tonight , I'll know that you have been praying against me and I'll punish you for it just the same as if I'd seen you do it . The unhappy Mrs . Cruncher shook her head . 
 Why , you're doing it in front of my face ! said Mr . Cruncher , angry and anxious . I'm not saying anything . Well , then , don't think anything either . You might as well kneel down and pray as think . You might as well betray me one way or another . Just stop it altogether . Yes , Jerry , said his wife . Yes , Jerry , ' repeated Mr . Cruncher sitting down to his tea . Ah ! That's right . ëYes , Jerry . ' That's about all you are allowed to say . You may say ëYes , Jerry . 'Mr . Cruncher didn't mean anything particular with these words , but he used them sarcastically , as people often do , to express unhappiness . 
 You and your Yes , Jerry , ' said Mr . Cruncher , taking a bite of his bread and butter . He seemed to take an invisible oyster out of his saucer and eat it . Ah ! I think so . I believe you . You're going out tonight ? asked his decent wife after he had taken another bite . Yes , I am . Can I go with you , Father ? asked his son quickly . No , you can't . I'm going fishing , as your mother knows . That's where I'm going . I'm going fishing . Your fishing rod gets pretty rusty , doesn't it , Father ? Never mind that . Are you going to bring any fish home , Father ? If I don't , you'll have very little food tomorrow , answered his father , shaking his head . That's enough questions from you . I'm not going out until you've been in bed for a long time . 
 He spent the rest of the night watching Mrs . Cruncher closely . He kept talking to her so that she wouldn't have time to think any evil thoughts about him . He told his son to keep talking to her too for the same reason , and he harassed the woman by talking about all the complaints he had against her rather than leave her to her own thoughts for a moment . The most religious person couldn't have believed more in the power of honest prayer than he believed in his wife's plotting against him . It was as if a person who says he doesn't believe in ghosts were frightened by a ghost story . 
 And remember ! said Mr . Cruncher . Don't play around tomorrow ! If I , an honest businessman , am able to put a joint of meat on the table , you won't decide to not eat it and only eat bread . And if I , an honest businessman , am able to get a little bit of beer , you won't decide to only drink water . When in Rome , do as the Romans do . Rome will treat you poorly if you don't . I am your Rome , you know . Then he began mumbling again : 
 You , turning down your own food and drink ! I don't know why you make it so hard for me to find food and drink , with your kneeling and praying and heartless behavior . Look at our son . He is your son , isn't he ? He's as thin as a board . You call yourself a mother ? Don't you know that a mother's first duty is to make her son fat and healthy ? Young Jerry was moved by this , and he begged his mother to perform the first duty of a mother and , whatever other parental duties she neglected , to put special emphasis on making him fat and healthy . 
 This is how the Cruncher family spent the evening until Young Jerry was sent to bed . Mr . Cruncher also sent Mrs . Cruncher to bed , and she obeyed . Mr . Cruncher spent the early part of the night smoking pipes alone and didn't go out on his errand until nearly one o'clock in the morning . Around that time , he got up from his chair , took a key out of his pocket , opened a locked cupboard , and took out a sack , a large crowbar , a rope , a chain , and other fishing equipment . Gathering these things about him , he muttered a last insult to Mrs . Cruncher , put out the light , and went out . 
 Young Jerry , who had only pretended to undress when he was sent to bed , snuck out and followed his father . Hidden by the darkness , he followed him out of the room , down the stairs , through the courtyard , and into the streets . He wasn't worried about getting back into the house again without a key . There were many lodgers staying there , and the front door was always left ajar all night . Young Jerry was driven by a wish to learn the skills and secrets his father of his father's honest work . He kept close to the house fronts , walls , and doorways as he kept his eyes on his father . His father was heading north and had not gone far when he was joined by another follower of Izaak Walton an English writer who wrote about fishing Izaak Walton , and the two men walked on together . 
 Within half an hour from when they set out , they were beyond the street lamps and the sleeping watchmen and were out on a deserted road . Another fisherman was picked up there . He joined them so quietly that if Young Jerry had been superstitious he might have thought that the second follower had actually split in two and become two people . 
 The three men continued on , and Young Jerry followed them , until the three stopped under a bank hanging out over the road . On the top of the bank there was a low brick wall , and on top of the wall was an iron railing . In the shadow of the bank and wall the three men turned into a hidden lane . The wall , which was about eight or ten feet high there , formed one side of the lane . Young Jerry crouched down in a corner and peeked into the lane . The next thing Young Jerry saw was his father in the moonlight . He was climbing an iron gate and soon had climbed over it . Then the second , and then the third man also climbed over it . They all landed quietly on the ground on the other side of the gate and lied there a littlelistening perhaps . Then they crawled away on their hands and knees . 
 It was Young Jerry's turn to go over to the gate , and he did it holding his breath . Crouching down in a corner again , he looked in and saw the three men crawling through some dirty grass . They were in a large churchyard . All of the gravestones looked like white ghosts that were watching them , and the church tower looked the ghost of an ugly giant . They hadn't crawled far when they stopped and stood up . Then they began to dig . 
 But Young Jerry was so anxious to know what the men were doing that he stopped and went back again . The men were still digging when he peeked in through the gate a second time . They seemed to have found something . There was a noise like a screw being turned coming from the ground , and the men's fingers strained as if they were lifting something heavy . Little by little the heavy object broke through the dirt and came to the surface . Young Jerry knew very well what it was . When he saw it , and saw his father about to open it , he was so scared since he'd never seen anything like that before that he ran away again . He didn't stop running until he had run a mile or more . 
 He wouldn't even have stopped then if he hadn't run out of breath . It was like he was running a ghostly race and he desperately wanted to reach the finish line . He felt like the coffin he had seen was chasing him , and he imagined it hopping behind him , standing upright on its narrow end . It was always close to catching him and was sometimes hopping right beside him . He imagined it grabbing his arm , and he wanted to get away from it . It seemed to be everywhere at once . He ran out into the road and avoided dark alleys , fearing it would come hopping out after him like a boy's kite without its tail and wings . 
 He imagined it hiding in doorways too . It would rub its shoulders against doors and lift them up to its ears as if it were laughing . It came out of the shadows on the road and lied on its back to trip him . All this time he still pictured it hopping behind him and gaining on him , so when Young Jerry got to his front door he was so tired he was half dead . But even then it wouldn't leave him alone . He imagined that it followed him up the stairs and into his bedroom , climbed into bed with him , and still wouldn't leave him alone in his sleep . 
 Young Jerry was woken up from his disturbed sleep in his little room by the sound of his father in the family room . It was after daybreak and before sunrise . Something had gone wrong for his father . At least that's what Young Jerry assumed , since he was holding Mrs . Cruncher by the ears and knocking the back of her head against the headboard of their bed . I told you I would , said Mr . Cruncher , and I did . Jerry , Jerry , Jerry ! his wife begged . You pray that I'll fail in my business dealings , said Jerry , and then my partners and I suffer . You're supposed to honor and obey your husband . Why the devil won't you ? I try to be a good wife , Jerry , the poor woman argued , crying . 
 Is it being a good wife to sabotage your husband's business ? Is it honoring your husband to dishonor his business ? Is it obeying your husband to disobey him on the important subject of his work ? You hadn't started this terrible work back when I made those vows , Jerry . You should be satisfied to be married to an honest businessman , snapped Mr . Cruncher . Don't concern your female mind with thoughts about when he was doing his job and when he wasn't . A wife who honored and obeyed her husband would leave his work alone altogether . You call yourself a religious woman ? If you're a religious woman , give me an irreligious woman ! You have no more natural sense of duty than the bottom of the Thames River has of a wooden beam , and just like that beam , some sense needs to be knocked into you . 
 They argued quietly , until Mr . Cruncher kicked off his clay-covered boots and lied down on the floor . After taking a nervous peek at him lying on his back , with his rust-covered hands under his head for a pillow , Young Jerry lay down too and fell asleep again . There was no fish for breakfast , or much of anything else . Mr . Cruncher was in a bad mood , and he kept an iron pot lid near him in case he saw Mrs . Cruncher saying grace and wanted to throw it at her . He brushed his hair and washed up at the usual time and went off to work with his son . 
 Young Jerry walked with the stool under his arm beside his father . They walked along Fleet Street , which was sunny and crowded . Young Jerry was very different than he had been the night before when he had run away from the coffin through the darkness alone . He was sharp again in the daylight , and his fears had left with the night . Its very possible that other people on Fleet Street and in other parts of London felt the same way that beautiful morning . Father , said Young Jerry as they walked along together . He made sure to keep his father at arm's length and to hold the stool between them . What's a resurrection man ? 
 Mr . Cruncher stopped on the sidewalk before he answered . How should I know ? I thought you knew everything , Father , said Young Jerry pretending unconvincingly . Hmm . Well , answered Mr . Cruncher , starting to walk again and taking his hat off to let his spiked hair out . He's a businessman . What merchandise does he trade in , Father ? asked the quick Young Jerry . His merchandise , said Mr . Cruncher after thinking it over , is of a scientific kind . People's bodies , isn't it , Father ? asked the boy , excited . I think it's something like that , said Mr . Cruncher . 
 Oh , Father , I want to be a resurrection man when I grow up ! Mr . Cruncher felt better , but he shook his head in a doubtful and moralizing way . That depends on how you develop your skills . If you work at developing your skills , and you don't say anymore to anybody than you have to , there's no telling what you might be good at . Young Jerry was encouraged by this and walked a few yards ahead to place the stool in the shadow of Temple Bar . Mr . Cruncher said to himself , Jerry , you honest businessman , there's a chance that the boy will be good luck to you after all and will make up for his mother ! 
 People had started drinking earlier than usual at Monsieur Defarge's wine shop . As early as six o'clock in the morning , sickly faces looking into the shop's barred windows had seen the faces of other people inside , hunched over their wine glasses . Monsieur Defarge sold very weak wine even when things were going well , but nowadays his wine was especially weak . Moreover , his wine tasted sour and made the people who drank it sour and depressed . Monsieur Defarge's wine didn't fire them with a Bacchanalian Bacchus was the Roman god of wine Bacchanalian flame , but instead filled them with a low , intense heat . 
 This was the third morning in a row that the drinking had started early at Monsieur Defarge's wine shop . It started on Monday , and now it was Wednesday . The patrons had been doing more worrying than drinking , for many men had been there listening , whispering , and wandering around since the doors opened who couldn't have afforded to buy a cup of wine if their lives depended on it . These men were as eager to be there as if they could afford entire barrels of wine . They moved from chair to chair , from one corner to the other , eagerly drinking in the conversation in place of wine . 
 Even though there were more people there than usual , Monsieur Defarge was nowhere to be seen . No one missed him , though , and nobody that came into the shop looked for him or asked where he was . No one thought it was strange to see Madame Defarge sitting alone serving wine . She had a bowl in front of her filled with old coins that were as worn and beaten up as the people who had owned them . 
 Apathy and boredom might have been what the spies who stopped into the wine shop saw . The spies stopped in at every place , of the highest or lowest class , from the royal palace to the jail . Card games dragged on , people built towers out of dominoes , and customers drew shapes on the tables with spilled drops of wine . Even Madame Defarge traced the pattern on her sleeve with a toothpick and stared off into the distance . 
 This is how it was in the wine shop in Saint Antoine until the middle of the day . At noon , two men covered in dust came walking through the streets under the swinging streetlamps . One of them was Monsieur Defarge . The other was a man wearing a blue cap who repaired roads . Dusty and thirsty , the two men entered the wine shop . Their arrival had sparked some excitement in Saint Antoine , which spread as they came through town and could be seen in the faces of the townspeople watching them from their doors and windows . No one followed them down the street , however , and no one in the wine shop said anything when they came in , although everyone there was watching them . 
 Good day , gentlemen ! said Monsieur Defarge . Saying this may have been a signal to let everyone know they could speak . Together everyone answered , Good day ! The weather is bad , gentlemen , said Defarge , shaking his head . When he said this , all the men looked at each other , then they looked at the ground and sat in silence . Except for one man , who got up and left . My wife , said Defarge out loud , speaking to Madame Defarge . I have traveled some distance with this repairer of roads named Jacques . I met him by chance a day and half's travel outside of Paris . He is a good kid , this repairer of roads named Jacques . Give him a drink , my wife ! 
 Another man got up and left . Madame Defarge put a glass of wine in front of the repairer of roads named Jacques . He tipped his blue cap to everyone and drank . In his shirt he had some rough , dark bread . He ate from it now and again and sat eating and drinking at Madame Defarge's counter . A third man got up and left . Monsieur Defarge refreshed himself with a cup of wine . He took less than was given to the stranger , since wine was something that was always available to him . He stood waiting until Jacques had finished his breakfast . Monsieur Defarge didn't look directly at anyone there , and no one looked at him , not even his wife , who was now busy knitting . 
 Have you finished your meal , my friend ? asked Monsieur Defarge after a while . Yes , thank you . Come on , then ! I'll show you the apartment I said you could stay in . It's perfect for you . They left the wine shop and went out into the street , then into a courtyard , up a steep staircase , and up into an attic . This was the same attic where Dr . Manette once sat on a bench , stooped over , busily making shoes . Dr . Manette wasn't there anymore . Instead , the three men who had left the wine shop one by one were all there . Between these men and Dr . Manette there was one small connection , though , for the men had all once watched him through the holes in these walls . 
 Defarge carefully closed the door and said quietly : Jacques One , Jacques Two , Jacques Three ! This is the witness that I , Jacques Four , went to meet . He will tell you everything . Tell them , Jacques Five ! The repairer of roads wiped his dark brow with his blue cap and said , Where should I begin , monsieur ? Begin at the beginning , was Monsieur Defarge's sensible reply . I saw a man , messieurs , said the repairer of roads , a year ago this summer , hiding under the marquis's carriage , hanging by a chain . Listen to how it happened . 
 I had just finished working on a road and was leaving . The sun was setting , and the marquis's carriage was slowly climbing up a hill and the man was hanging beneath it by a chainlike this . The repairer of roads acted it all out again . He ought to have perfected his act by then , since he had been entertaining his village with it for the whole year . Jacques One jumped in and asked if he had ever seen the man before . Never , answered the repairer of roads , standing up straight again . 
 Jacques Three wanted to know how he was able to recognize him if he had never seen him before . He was very tall , said the repairer of roads quietly , with his finger on his nose . When the marquis asked me that night what the man looked like , I answered , As tall as a ghost . You should have said as short as a dwarf , answered Jacques Two . But how was I to know ? The deed hadn't been committed yet . And the man didn't tell me what he was going to do . Look ! Even then , I didn't offer up my statement . The marquis pointed me out with his finger while I was standing near our little fountain . He says , Bring that rascal to me ! ' On my word , messieurs , I didn't offer up any information . 
 He's right there , Jacques , mumbled Defarge to the man who had interrupted . Go on ! Good ! said the repairer of roads mysteriously . The tall man disappeared . They've been looking for him for how many months ? Nine ? Ten ? Eleven ? The number of months doesn't matter , said Defarge . He is well hidden , but unfortunately he's finally been found . Go on ! Once again I was working up on the hillside and the sun was about to set . I was collecting my tools to go back to my cottage in the village below where it was already dark . I looked up and I saw six soldiers coming over the hill . In the middle of them was a tall man , and his arms were tied to his sideslike this ! 
 With the help of his cap , he showed them how the man had his elbows bound to his sides with a rope that was tied behind him . I stood there , messieurs , by my pile of stones , and watched the soldiers and their prisoner walk past . The road is isolated so anything that happens there is worth watching . At first , as they got closer , I didn't notice anything besides the fact that they were six soldiers with a tall man who was tied up . They were silhouetted against the sun , so they appeared only as black outlines , except on the side the sun was setting on , where they were edged in red , messieurs . 
 Also , I could see their shadows on the hollow ridge on the other side of the road and on the hill above it . Their shadows were long and looked like the shadows of giants . Also , I saw that they were covered in dust and that they were kicking up dust as they walked closer . But when they got very close to me I recognized the tall man and he recognized me . Oh , he would have been happy to jump over the hillside again the way he had the night when he and I first met , close to that same place ! 
 He described it as if he were there , and it was obvious that he saw it all clearly . Perhaps he hadn't seen much else excitement in his life . I didn't let the soldiers see that I recognized the tall man , and he didn't let them see that he recognized me . We did all of it with our eyes . ëCome on ! ' said the leader of the group , pointing to the village . ëBring him quickly to his grave ! ' At that , they started walking faster . I followed . His arms were swollen from being tied up so tightly , and his wooden shoes were large and awkward . He was limping , walking slowly because of this , and the soldiers were prodding him forward with their gunslike this ! 
 He showed them how the man was pushed forward by the butt ends of the muskets . As they went down the hill like mad men running a race , the tall man fell . The soldiers laughed and picked him up again . His face was bleeding and covered with dust , but he couldn't touch it . So they laughed at him again . They brought him to the village , and all the villagers came running to look at him . The soldiers took him past the mill and up to the prison . All the villagers watched the prison gate open in the darkness of the night and the tall man go inside . It looked like the prison gate swallowed himlike this ! 
 All of the villagers left , continued the repairer of roads . He was on his tiptoes and speaking quietly . All of them whispered by the fountain . All of them went to sleep . All of them dreamed of the poor man , locked up behind bars in the prison on the hill , and never to come out again except to be executed . In the morning , carrying my tools on my shoulder , eating a bit of black bread as I went , I walked by the prison on my way to work . I saw him there , high up , behind the bars of an iron cage . He was looking out , covered in blood and dust , as he was the night before . His hands weren't free so he couldn't wave to me , and I was afraid to call out to him . He looked at me like he were already dead . 
 Defarge and the three men looked at one another . Their looks were angry and hate filled as they listened to the man's story . Although they were secretive , they all had a commanding presence . They looked like three judges . Jacques One and Two were sitting on an old pallet bed , and they both had their chins on their hands and their eyes focused closely on the repairer of roads . Jacques Three , equally focused on the man , was on one knee behind them . He kept running his hand over his mouth and nose . Defarge was standing between them and the man telling the story , whom he had placed in the light of the window . He kept looking back and forth from the repairer of roads to the other men . 
 Go on , Jacques , said Defarge . He was up in his iron cage for several days . The villagers looked at him secretly , for they were all afraid , but they kept looking up at him from far away . At night , when everyone had finished working for the day and had gathered to gossip at the fountain , everyone would look at the prison . Before , everyone faced the posting house . Now , they faced the prison . 
 They would whisper at the fountain that although the man had been sentenced to death , he would not be killed . They would say that a petition had been presented in Paris that proved that he had been driven insane by the death of his child . They say that a petition had been presented to the king himself . What do I know ? It's possible . Maybe yes , maybe no . Listen then , Jacques , Jacques One interrupted sternly . Know that a petition was presented to the king and queen . Everyone here , except you , saw the king take it while he was in his carriage in the street , sitting next to the queen . It was Defarge , this man here , who , risking his life , ran out in front of the horses with the petition in his hand . 
 And listen again , Jacques , said Jacques Three , who was kneeling down . He kept running his fingers over his face in a noticeably greedy way , as if hungry for something besides food and drink . The guards , on horse and on foot , surrounded Defarge as he presented the petition and beat him . Understand ? I understand , messieurs . Go on then , said Defarge . On the other hand , there are also rumors at the fountain , continued the man , that he has been brought down here to be executed right away and that he will definitely be killed . 
 There are even rumors that because he killed a marquis who ruled over his serfs a farmer who cultivated land owned by someone else and who was bought and sold with the land serfs , he is like a father to his serfs and the tall man will be executed for parricide killing a parent parricide . One old man at the fountain said that his right hand , holding a knife , will be burned off in front of his eyes . He said they'd make wounds in his arms , chest , and legs and pour boiling oil , melted lead , hot resin , wax , and sulfur into them . Finally , they will tear his arms and legs off by four strong horses . The old man said that all of this was actually done to a prisoner who tried to assassinate the last king , Louis the Fifteenth . But how should I know if he's telling the truth ? I'm not a scholar . 
 Listen once again then , Jacques ! said the man who kept touching his face greedily with his hand . The name of that prisoner was Damiens . It was all done in broad daylight , publicly , in the streets of Paris . Nothing was more noticed in the large crowd that saw it than the group of upper-class ladies who were eager and excited to see the whole thing through to the very end . To the very end , Jacques , which didn't happen until nighttime , when he had lost two legs and an arm but was still breathing . And it was donewait , how old are you ? I'm thirty-five , said the repairer of roads , who looked sixty . 
 It was done when you were over ten years old . Maybe you saw it . Enough ! said Defarge impatiently . Long live the devil ! Continue . Well ! Some say this and some say that . They don't talk about anything else . Even the fountain seems to be whispering about it . After a while , on a Sunday night when all the villagers were asleep , some soldiers came down from the prison . You could hear their guns tapping on the street as they marched . Workmen dug and hammered , and soldiers laughed and sang . In the morning , there was a gallows built forty feet high near the fountain . The repairer of roads seemed to look through the ceiling . He pointed as if he could see the gallows off in the sky . 
 Everyone stopped working and gathered there . Nobody took the cows out . The cows were there with everyone else . At midday there was a drum roll . Soldiers had marched into the prison at night , and the tall man was now with the soldiers . He's tied up like he was before , and there was a gag in his mouth , tied with a tight string that made him look like he was laughing . The man showed them what he looked like by putting his thumbs in the corners of his mouth and pulling them back toward his ears . On the top of the gallows they had attached the knife that killed the marquis . The blade was pointing up toward the air . They hanged him there forty feet in the air , and his body is still hanging , poisoning the water of the fountain . 
 The men all looked at each other . The man had started sweating while he told the story , and he used his blue cap to wipe his face . It's terrible , messieurs . How can women and children fetch water from the fountain ? Who can gather and gossip there now that a man has been killed there ? When I left the village Monday evening , as the sun was setting , I looked back from the hill and the shadow of the man hanging from the gallows fell across the church , the mill , and the prison . It seemed to fall across the whole world , messieurs ! 
 The greedy man chewed on one of his fingers as he looked at the other three , and his finger shook with a hunger for something other than food . That's all , messieurs . I left at sunset as I had been told to do , and I walked the rest of the night and half of the next day until I met this man here , as I was told . I came with him , sometimes riding a horse and sometimes walking , through the rest of yesterday and last night . And here I am ! After a gloomy silence , Jacques One said , Good ! You have done the right thing and have told your story well . Will you wait for us a little while outside ? Of course , said the repairer of roads . Defarge brought him to the top of the stairs , left him sitting there , and came back . 
 The three men had gotten up and were standing together when Defarge came back into the attic . What do you say , Jacques ? asked Jacques One . Should we put them on the list ? To be put on the list and destroyed , answered Defarge . Wonderful ! said the greedy man . The chateau and the whole family ? asked Jacques One . The chateau and the whole family , answered Defarge . Extermination . The hungry man said Wonderful ! again and began chewing another finger . 
 Jacques , answered Defarge standing up straight , even if my wife took on the job of keeping the list only in her memory , she wouldn't forget a word of it ! Not a single syllable . She has knitted it herself in her own code , and it will always be as clear to her as the sun . You can trust Madame Defarge . It would be easier for the weakest coward to take his own life than it would be to erase one letter of his name or crimes from the list that Madame Defarge is knitting . 
 The men all mumbled approvingly . Then the hungry man asked , Are we going to send the repairer of roads back home soon ? I hope so . He isn't very smart . Isn't he a bit dangerous ? He doesn't know anything , said Defarge . At least nothing more than what would get him hanged , too . I'll take responsibility for him . Let him stay with me . I'll take care of him and then send him on his way . He wants to see the world of the upper classes : the king , the queen , and the court . Let him see them on Sunday . 
 What ? shouted the hungry man , staring at him . Isn't it a bad sign that he wants to see royalty and nobility ? Jacques , said Defarge . Show a cat just a little bit of milk if you want it to thirst for it . Show a dog his natural prey if you want it to hunt it one day . They didn't say anything else . They found the repairer of roads asleep on the top stair and told him to lie down on the pallet bed and rest . He didn't need to be persuaded and was soon fast asleep . 
 Worse places than Defarge's wine shop could easily be found in Paris for an unsophisticated peasant like him . Except for a mysterious fear of Madame Defarge that bothered him constantly , his life was new and exciting . But Madame Defarge sat at the counter all day , ignoring him and determined not to show that his being had any connection to a secret plan . 
 Therefore , when Sunday came , the repairer of roads was not happy , although he claimed he was , to find out that Madame Defarge was to go with Defarge and himself to Versailles . It was additionally worrisome to have Madame Defarge knitting the whole way there on public transportation . It was also worrisome to have her in the crowd that afternoon still holding her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to see the carriage of the king and queen . 
 Bravo ! said Defarge . He gave him a fatherly pat on the back when it was all over . You're a good boy ! he said . The repairer of roads was now regaining his senses . He worried that he had done something wrong by behaving the way he had , but he had not . You are the man we want , said Defarge in his ear . You make these fools think that this will all go on forever . That makes them more disrespectful and will end this all that much sooner . Hey ! yelled the repairer of roads , thinking about what he said . That's true . 
 These fools know nothing . They hate your very breath and wish they could end your life , your life or a hundred like it rather than harm one of their own horses or dogs . But they only know what you or people like you tell them . Keep fooling them then , a bit longer . It can't fool them too much . Madame Defarge looked at him arrogantly and nodded in agreement . As far as you're concerned , she said , you would cheer and cry for anything that made an impressive show and a lot of sound . Wouldn't you ? Honestly , madame , I think so . At least for the moment . 
 If you were shown a big pile of dolls and were told to pull them apart and steal parts of them to take for yourself , you would pick out the richest and most colorful . Wouldn't you ? Honestly , madame , yes . Yes . And if you were shown a flock of birds that couldn't fly and were told to pluck off their feathers and take for them yourself , you would go after the birds with the prettiest feathers , wouldn't you ? It's true , madame . You've seen both dolls and birds today , said Madame Defarge with a wave of her hand toward where the king and queen and their attendants had been seen . Now go home ! 
 The chateau and the hut , the stone face and the hanged man , the red stain on the stone floor and the pure water in the village well , thousands of acres of land , a whole province of France , even all of France , and everything under the night skyall are just a line as thin as a hair on the timeline of man . Our whole world and all the events that take place on it , both big and little , pass in the twinkling of a star . And just as human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyze what it's made of , so more intelligent beings might be able to analyze all of the thoughts , deeds , vices , and virtues of every human being on earth . 
 Monsieur and Madame Defarge came moving along slowly in the darkness in the public vehicle , to the gate of Paris , which lay in the path to their destination . They were stopped at the barrier guardhouse , as usual . Soldiers with lanterns came toward them to ask questions , and Monsieur Defarge got down from the vehicle since he knew one or two of the soldiers and one of the policemen . He knew the policeman well and embraced him . 
 When they had reached Saint Antoine again that night , they finally got down near the edge of the town . As they walked through the black mud and garbage in the streets , Madame Defarge spoke to her husband : Say then , my friend . What did Jacques the policeman tell you ? He told me all he knows , which isn't much tonight . There's been another spy hired for our neighborhood . There might be many more , for all he knows , but he knows of one for sure . Oh , well ! said Madame Defarge , raising her eyebrows in a calm , businesslike manner . We'll need to put him on the list . What do they call him ? He's English . 
 Even better . What's his name ? Barsad , said Defarge , using the French pronunciation . But he had been so careful to get the name right that he said it perfectly . Barsad , repeated Madame Defarge . Good . What's his first name ? John . John Barsad , repeated Madame Defarge after repeating it to herself . Good . What does he look like , does anyone know ? He's about forty years old . He's about five feet nine inches tall . He has black hair and a dark complexion . He's generally handsome . He has dark eyes ; a long , thin , yellow face , and he has a hooked nose that curves toward his left cheek , which gives him a mean look . My goodness . It's a portrait ! said Madame Defarge , laughing . I'll put him on the list tomorrow . 
 They went into the wine shop , which was closed because it was midnight . Madame Defarge immediately took her place at her desk and counted the small amount of money the shop had earned while they were gone . She inspected the stock , looked through the entries in the book , made some entries herself , inspected the bartender in every way possible , and finally sent him off to bed . Then she poured out the coins in the money bowl again and began to tie them up in a handkerchief . She tied them up in a line of separate knots to keep them from being stolen during the night . All this time Defarge had his pipe in his mouth and was pacing up and down , admiring her work but staying out of her way . This is the way he handled all of their business and personal affairs in life . 
 It was a hot night , and the shop was in a filthy area of town and smelled bad . Monsieur Defarge's sense of smell wasn't delicate at all , but the wine stock seemed to smell much stronger than it had ever tasted , as did the rum , brandy , and anise a licorice-flavored liqueur anise . He waved the combination of scents away as he finished his pipe and put it down . You're tired , said Madame Defarge , looking up as she tied the coins into the handkerchief . They are only the usual smells . I'm a little tired , her husband admitted . You're a little depressed too , said Madame Defarge , who was never so focused on the shop's business that she didn't notice how her husband was doing . Oh , men , men ! 
 But , my dear ! Defarge began . But , my dear ! ' Madame Defarge repeated , nodding at him . But , my dear ! You are depressed tonight , my dear ! Well , then , said Defarge , as if she had wrung the thought out of him . It is a long time . It is a long time , repeated his wife , and when isn't it a long time ? Revenge takes a long time . It's just the way it is . It doesn't take a long time for a man to be struck by lightning , said Defarge . How long , asked Madame Defarge calmly , does it take to make and store the lightning ? Tell me . Defarge looked up thoughtfully , as if there were some sense in what she had said . 
 It doesn't take a long time , said Madame Defarge , for an earthquake to destroy a town . Well ! Tell me , how long does it take to create an earthquake ? A long time , I suppose , said Defarge . But when it is ready , it takes place and destroys everything in its path . In the meantime , it is always growing , although no one sees or hears it . Take comfort in that . 
 She tied a coin into a knot with a fierce look in her eyes , as if she were strangling an enemy . I tell you , said Madame Defarge , reaching out her right hand for emphasis , that although it is taking a long time , it is on its way . I tell you that revenge never turns back and never stops . I tell you that it is always moving forward . Look around and think about the lives of all the people we know . Consider the faces , the rage and unhappiness , that the group of Jacques comes closer to addressing every hour . Can such things last ? Bah ! You're being ridiculous . 
 My brave wife , answered Defarge , standing in front of her with his head bent down a little . His hands were clasped behind his back , like a submissive student in front of his Sunday-school teacher , I don't doubt any of what you are saying . But it's lasted a long time . It's possibleyou know well that it isthat change might not come during our lifetimes . And so what ? asked Madame Defarge , tying another knot as if she were strangling another enemy . Well ! said Defarge , with a shrug . We shall not see victory . 
 We will have helped to cause it , answered Madame Defarge , waiving her hand for emphasis . Nothing that we do is wasted . I believe with all of my soul that we shall see victory . But even if we don't , even if I knew that we would not , show me the neck of an aristocrat who is a tyrant and I wouldThen Madame Defarge , clenching her teeth , violently tied another knot in the handkerchief . Hold on ! yelled Defarge . He blushed a little , as if he felt she were calling him a coward . I too , my dear , will stop at nothing . 
 Yes ! But it is your weakness that sometimes you need to see your victim and an opportunity in front of you to keep you going . You need to stay focused without that . When the time comes , let yourself go like a tiger and a devil . But until then , keep yourself in checkalways ready to pounce , but hidden where no one can see . Madame punctuated the end of this sentence by hitting the little counter with her chain of money as if she were beating the counter's brains out . Then she gathered the heavy handkerchief under her arm calmly and told him that it was time to go to bed . 
 At noon the next day , Madame Defarge was at her usual place in the wine shop , knitting busily . There was a rose beside her , and she glanced at it now and then , but with her usual preoccupied appearance . There were a few customers there . Some were drinking and some were not . Some were standing and some were sitting or hanging around . It was a very hot day , and lots of flies were investigating the sticky little wine glasses near Madame Defarge and dropping dead at the bottoms . 
 The other flies weren't bothered by seeing the dead flies . They looked at them indifferently , as if they themselves were elephants or something else completely unrelated to them , until they too ended up dead . It's strange to think how oblivious flies are ! Perhaps the lords and ladies at the royal court were thinking just as much that sunny summer day . A person coming in through the door of the wine shop cast his shadow on Madame Defarge , and Madame Defarge felt it was someone she didn't know . She put down her knitting and started to pin her rose to her hat before she looked at the stranger . 
 It was strange . The moment Madame Defarge picked up the rose , all of the customers stopped talking and gradually left the wine shop . Good day , madame , said the newcomer . Good day , monsieur , answered Madame Defarge . She said the last words out loud , and to herself she added , Ha ! Good day to you , about forty years old , about five feet nine inches tall with black hair , a handsome appearance , a dark complexion , dark eyes , and long , thin , yellow face with a hooked nose that leans toward the left cheek , giving you a mean look ! Good day ! 
 Would you be kind enough to give me a little glass of aged cognac and a drink of cool , fresh water , madame ? Madame Defarge politely gave him what he asked . This cognac is marvelous , madame ! It was the first time anyone had complimented her cognac , and she knew enough about where it came from to know it was not good cognac . She said , however , that the cognac was flattered by his comment and she resumed her knitting . The visitor watched her fingers for a few moments and then looked around the wine shop . 
 You're very good at knitting , madame . I am used to it . It's a very pretty pattern too . You think so ? she said , smiling at him . Definitely . Can I ask what it's for ? It's just a hobby , said Madame Defarge , still smiling at him while her fingers worked quickly . It's not for a particular use ? That depends . I may find a use for it someday . If I do , wellÖ , said Madame Defarge . She took a breath and nodded in almost a flirtatious way , then I'll use it . 
 It was amazing that the people of Saint Antoine seemed to hate the rose on Madame Defarge's headband . Two men had come into the wine shop separately and had been about to order a drink . When they saw the rose they stuttered and pretended they were looking for a friend who wasn't there , then they left . Of all the people who had been there when the visitor had come in , not one of them was still there . They had all gone . The spy had been watching but hadn't noticed the sign . They had all wandered off in a poor , casual way that looked perfectly normal and innocent . 
 John , Madame Defarge thought as she knit the name into her list and kept looking at the stranger . If you stay long enough I will have knit Barsad' before you've left . Do you have a husband , madame ? I do . Children ? No children . Business seems bad . Business is very bad . All the people are poor . Ah , those poor , unlucky people ! So oppressed too , like you say . As you say , Madame Defarge said , correcting him . She skillfully knit something extra into his name that promised him nothing good . 
 Excuse me . Of course it was I who said so , but of course you think so too . I think so ? answered Madame Defarge in a high voice . My husband and I are busy enough keeping this wine shop open . We don't have time to think . All we think about here is how to survive . That is the subject we think about , and it gives us enough to think about from morning to night , without worrying about other people . I ? Think for other people ? No , no . 
 The spy was there to find any little bits of information he could . He didn't allow his confusion to show on his face . Instead he stood there looking like he just wanted to gossip casually . He leaned his elbow on Madame Defarge's little counter , occasionally sipping his cognac . Gaspard's execution is a shame , madame . Ah ! Poor Gaspard ! he sighed sympathetically . My faith ! answered Madame Defarge , casually . If people stab other people with knives , they need to pay for it . He knew beforehand what the punishment would be . He has paid the price for his crime . 
 I believe , whispered the spy , looking conspiratorial , I believe there is a lot of sympathy and anger for the poor man in this neighborhood , isn't there ? Between you and me ? Is there ? asked Madame Defarge innocently . Isn't there ? Here is my husband ! said Madame Defarge . As Monsieur Defarge came through the door of the wine shop , the spy saluted him by touching his hat and said with a smile , Good day , Jacques ! Defarge stopped walking and stared at him . 
 Good day , Jacques ! repeated the spy . He didn't speak quite as confidently or smile quite as easily this time . You are confused , monsieur , answered the owner of the wine shop . You must have confused me for someone else . That's not my name . I am Ernest Defarge . Whatever , said the spy lightheartedly , but a bit uneasily too . Good day ! Good day ! answered Defarge , coldly . I was telling your wife , whom I had the pleasure of chatting with when you entered , that I hear there is a lot of sympathy and anger in Saint Antoine about the execution of poor Gaspard . 
 No one has told me that , said Defarge , shaking his head . I know nothing about it . After he said this he walked behind the little counter and stood with his hand on the back of his wife's chair . He looked over his wife at the spy , whom either of them would have shot him with the greatest satisfaction . The spy , accustomed to his job , didn't change his casual attitude . He finished his little glass of cognac and took a sip of water . He asked for another glass of cognac , and Madame Defarge poured it for him and went back to her knitting . She hummed a little song while she knit . 
 You seem to know this quarter well . I mean , even better than I do , observed Defarge . Not at all , but I hope to get to know it better . I am extremely interested in the unfortunate people who live here . Hah ! Defarge muttered . The joy of talking with you , Monsieur Defarge , reminds me , continued the spy , that I am lucky enough to know some things about you . Really ! said Defarge , indifferently . Yes , really . I know that when Dr . Manette was released from prison , you , his old servant , took care of him . He was brought to you . You see that I know about the situation ? 
 That's true , for sure , said Defarge . His wife let him know by brushing her elbow against him as she knitted and sang that he should answer , but only as briefly as possible . His daughter came to you , said the spy . And she took Dr . Manette from you , along with a well-dressed man in brown . What is his name ? He had a little wig . Lorry ! From Tellson and Company over in England . That's true , repeated Defarge .
