 But I thinkI knowthat he does .
 If you know it , it's good enough for me .
 What do you want me to do , my darling .
 It hurts me to know that I treated him poorly , said Charles Darnay , surprised .
 I never knew this about him .
 Miss Manette's faith in MrCarton made her look so beautiful that her husband could have looked at her for hours .
 Darnay was moved by her request .
 I will always remember it , dear heart .
 I will remember it as long as I live .
 At first there were times when whatever she was working on would fall slowly out of her hands and she would look sad , even though overall she was a completely happy young wife .
 For there was something coming in the echoes , something far away and barely able to be heard , that upset her .
 She was caught between feelings of hope and doubthopes of a love still unknown to her and doubts that she would stay on earth long enough to enjoy that love .
 In the echoes she would hear the sound of footsteps at her own grave , as if she had died young , and she would think of her husband whom she had left so alone .
 In her imagination , he would mourn so much for her that his eyes would overflow with tears .
 In the years that she worked to bring them closer together and make them a happy family , Lucie heard in the echoes nothing but friendly and soothing sounds .
 Her husband was strong and prosperous .
 Her father was stable and healthy .
 Miss Pross was like an unruly charger a large , strong cavalry horse charger who had been tamed and domesticated , and snorted and pawed at the ground under the plane tree in the garden .
 MrStryver shoved his way toward success as a lawyer , like a ship plowing through rough waters , and dragged his helpful friend MrCarton along with him .
 Sydney , like a sinking boat , had a tough time being dragged along , but since he had always done so , he continued with that life .
 MrCarton's attachment to the life he was used to , unfortunately stronger in him than any desire to desert MrStryver or avoid the disgrace of this life , made that life the one MrCarton was to lead .
 He didn't think any more of being the jackal to MrStryver's lion than a real jackal would think of becoming a lion .
 Stryver was rich .
 He had married an old widow with property and three boys , who had nothing particularly exciting about them but the straight hair on their fat heads .
 But there were other echoes that were rumbling off in the distance all this time .
 And it was around Little Lucie's sixth birthday that they started to get louder , like a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising .
 One night in the middle of July 1789 , MrLorry came in late from Tellson's Bank and sat down by Lucie and her husband in the dark window .
 It was a hot , wild night , and they were all reminded of that Sunday night years before when they had sat in the same place and watched the lightning .
 I was starting to think that I'd have to spend the night at the bank , said MrLorry , pushing back his brown wig .
 We were so busy all day that we didn't know what to do first or where to go .
 There is such nervousness in Paris that there was actually a run to put money in Tellson's Bank .
 Our customers in Paris can't seem to transfer their property to us fast enough .
 They're all practically mad about sending their valuables to England .
 Looks bad , you say , my dear Darnay .
 Yes , but we don't know what sense there is in it .
 People can be so irrational .
 Some of us at Tellson's are getting old and can't be bothered with unusual things happening unless there's a good reason for it .
 Still , said Darnay , you know how gloomy and threatening the situation is over there .
 Here he is , said the doctor , coming into the dark room .
 I'm happy that you're at home .
 All of this anxiousness that I've been surrounded by all day has made me nervous for no reason .
 You're not going out , I hope .
 No .
 I'm going to play backgammon here with you , if you want , said the doctor .
 I don't think I want to , if I can speak my mind .
 I'm too worried to compete against you tonight .
 Is the tea tray still there , Lucie .
 I can't see it .
 Thank you , my dear .
 Your precious daughter is safe in bed .
 And sleeping soundly .
 It's not a theory .
 just something I like to imagine .
 It's your imagination then , my wise pet , said MrLorry , patting her hand .
 These echoes are very numerous and very loud , though , aren't they .
 Listen to them .
 Stay close to me , Jacques Three , yelled Defarge .
 And you , Jacques One and Two , split up and put yourselves in charge of as many of these patriots as you can .
 Where is my wife .
 Hey .
 Here I am .
 said Madame Defarge , as calm as ever , but not knitting today .
 Instead , Madame Defarge had an axe in her right hand and a pistol and a cruel-looking knife in her girdle .
 Where are you going , my wife .
 I'm going with you right now , said Madame Defarge .
 You'll see me leading the women soon .
 Come , then .
 yelled Defarge loudly .
 Patriots and friends , we are ready .
 To the Bastille .
 With a roar that sounded as if every person in France had yelled the word Bastille , the crowd of peasants rose up and overflowed the city .
 With alarm bells ringing , drums beating , and the crowd thundering like the sea , the attack began .
 Then there was one deep ditch , a single drawbridge , huge stone walls , eight large towers , cannon , muskets , fire , and smoke to contend with .
 One drawbridge had been taken down .
 Work , my friends , work .
 shouted Defarge .
 Work , Jacques One , Jacques Two , Jacques One Thousand , Jacques Two Thousand , Jacques Twenty-Five Thousand , in the name of all the angels or the devilswhichever you preferwork .
 So Defarge the wine seller yelled , still at his cannon , which had long before grown hot from firing .
 The force of the crowd that was sweeping him along was so powerful that he couldn't even catch a breath or turn his head until he was in the outer courtyard of the Bastille .
 There , pushed up against an angle of a wall , he struggled to look around .
 Jacques Three was almost beside him , and Madame Defarge could be seen inside in the distance , still leading some of her women .
 She had her knife in her hand .
 Everywhere there was commotion , celebration , confusion , and deafening noise .
 The prisoners .
 The records .
 The secret prison cells .
 The torture devices .
 The prisoners .
 Show me the North Tower .
 said Defarge .
 Quick .
 I promise I will if you will come with me , answered the man .
 But there is no one there .
 What does One Hundred and Five , North Tower mean .
 asked Defarge .
 Quick .
 What does it mean , monsieur .
 Does it mean a prisoner , or a cell .
 Or should I strike you dead .
 Kill him .
 yelled Jacques Three , who had come up close to him .
 Monsieur , it is a cell .
 Show it to me .
 Come this way , then .
 Jacques Three , looking hungry as usual and apparently disappointed that the conversation had taken a turn that wouldn't lead to bloodshed , held Defarge's arm as Defarge held the prison guard's .
 Their three heads had been close together during this brief conversation , and they could still barely hear each other since the crowd was so loud as it poured into the fortress and covered the courts and hallways and staircases .
 Outside , the walls shook with the roar of the crowd too , and individual yells and sounds could occasionally be heard above the uproar .
 One hundred and five , North Tower .
 Move your torch slowly over these walls so that I can see them , Defarge told the guard .
 The man obeyed , and Defarge looked at the wall carefully as the light passed over it .
 Stop .
 Look here , Jacques .
 said Jacques Three , reading greedily .
 He still had the linstock a long staff designed to hold a lit match and used to fire cannons linstock of his cannon in his hand .
 He traded the gun for the man's crowbar , turned to the worm-eaten stool and table , and smashed them to pieces .
 Nothing in the wood , and nothing in the straw , Jacques .
 Nothing .
 Let's gather all of it in the middle of the cell .
 Light them , you .
 he said to the guard .
 The guard set the little pile on fire , and it blazed high and hot .
 They bent over again to come through the low-arched door , leaving the pile burning behind them , and went back the way they came to the courtyard .
 It seemed their hearing returned as they came down , until they were in the middle of the raging crowd again .
 The crowd was in a frenzy looking for Defarge himself .
 The people of Saint Antoine wanted their wine-shop keeper in the front of the group and guarding the governor , who had defended the Bastille and shot people .
 Otherwise , the governor would not be taken to the Hotel de Ville for judgment .
 Otherwise he might escape and the people would not get revenge on their spilled blood , which had been worthless for so many years but suddenly had value .
 The crowd was dark , destructive , and violent , and its numbers and force were still unknown .
 The crowd of wavering shapes , voices of revenge , and faces hardened by suffering had no pity left in it .
 The exhausted people of Saint Antoine had had only one triumphant week to overcome their suffering with embraces and congratulations .
 Now Madame Defarge sat at her counter at the wine shop serving her customers as usual .
 Madame Defarge wasn't wearing her rose in her hair , for in one short week the large brotherhood of spies had become extremely cautious , as they knew they could soon be hanged like the streetlamps .
 Madame Defarge sat out in the morning sun with her arms folded , thinking about the wine shop and the street .
 In both locations there were several groups of people .
 They were poor and unhappy , but now they had a noticeable sense of power placed over their unhappiness .
 Even the most miserable person in the most tattered nightcap was saying , I know how hard it has become for me to make a living , but do you know how easy it has become for me take your life away from you .
 People who had been unemployed before now had the work of revenge available to them at all times .
 The fingers of the knitting women were vicious , knowing that they could tear .
 Saint Antoine looked different .
 It had been changing into this for hundreds of years , and the final changes of the past week were evident .
 A rumor rushed to them like a line of gunpowder set on fire .
 It's Monsieur Defarge , said Madame Defarge .
 Silence , everyone .
 Defarge came in out of breath , pulled off the red cap he wore , and looked around .
 Listen , everyone .
 Madame Defarge said again .
 Listen to him .
 Defarge stood there , panting as a crowd of people formed behind him outside the door and watched him with eager eyes and open mouths .
 Everyone in the wine shop had jumped to his feet .
 News from the outside world .
 How .
 yelled Madame angrily .
 The other world .
 Does everyone here remember old Foulon , who told starving people that they should eat grass , and who died and was sent to hell for it .
 Everybody does .
 they all responded .
 It's news about him .
 He is here among us .
 Among us .
 everyone responded .
 And dead .
 They all shouted so loudly that a miserable old man more than seventy years old would have known in his heart that Defarge was right .
 A moment of profound silence followed .
 Defarge and his wife looked steadily at each other .
 The Vengeance stooped over , and the bang of a drum was heard as she moved out from behind the counter at her feet .
 Instantly Madame Defarge had her knife in her girdle .
 The drum was beating in the street as if it and the drummer had come together by magic .
 The Vengeance , shrieking loudly and flinging her arms around over her head like all forty Furies snake-haired winged goddesses in Greek mythology who punished wrongdoing Furies , was running from house to house , calling the women to action .
 Nevertheless , they didn't lose a moment .
 Not a moment .
 Foulon was at the Hotel de Ville , and he might be let go .
 He would never be let go , though , if the people of Saint Antoine knew how they had suffered and been insulted and wronged .
 Men and women armed with weapons hurried from the neighborhood so fast , bringing everyone nearby with them , that within fifteen minutes no one remained in Saint Antoine but a few old women and some crying children .
 No .
 By then they were all crowded into the Hall of Examinationwhere this mean , ugly old man was or they overflowed into the nearby streets .
 Monsieur and Madame Defarge , The Vengeance , and Jacques Three were in the front and very close to him in the Hall .
 See .
 yelled Madame Defarge , pointing to him with her knife .
 See the old villain tied with ropes .
 They did well to tie a bunch of grass on his back .
 Ha , ha .
 That was done well .
 Now let him eat it .
 Madame put her knife under her arm and applauded as if she were at a play .
 It wasn't until nighttime that the men and women came back to their homes .
 Their children were crying and hungry , and the poor bakeries were filled with long lines of people who waited patiently to buy bad bread .
 While they waited hungrily , they passed the time by embracing and reliving the triumphs of the day .
 Eventually these lines of poor people broke up and they left .
 Then meager lights began to shine in the windows , and meager fires were made in the streets , where neighbors cooked together , then ate in their doorways afterward .
 It has come at last , my dear .
 But this wasn't the change that took place in the village , and in the many villages like it .
 For many years , the upper class had abused the village and had hardly even come there except to hunt .
 Sometimes they came to hunt people , sometimes animals , for which the upper class preserved pieces of wild and barren wilderness .
 No .
 The change was that the rough lower classes were appearing , rather than that the beautiful upper classes were disappearing .
 The man looked at him , looked at the village in the hollow , looked at the mill and at the prison on the crag .
 When he had seen these , he said in a dialect that was almost unintelligible : 
 How's it going , Jacques .
 All is well , Jacques .
 Touch then .
 They joined hands and the man sat on the pile of stones .
 No lunch .
 Nothing but dinner now , said the repairer of roads , looking hungry .
 It's the same everywhere , complained the man .
 No one has any lunch .
 Touch then .
 This time the repairer of roads said it after watching the man put the object in his pipe .
 They joined hands again .
 Tonight .
 asked the repairer of roads .
 Tonight , said the man , putting his pipe in his mouth .
 Where .
 Here .
 Show me .
 said the man , moving up the hill .
 See .
 answered the repairer of roads , pointing with his finger .
 You go down here , and straight through the street , and past the fountain
.
 To hell with that .
 interrupted the man , looking over the landscape .
 I don't go through the streets or past any fountains .
 Well .
 Good .
 When do you finish work .
 At sunset .
 Will you wake me up before you leave .
 I have walked two nights without stopping .
 Let me finish my pipe and I'll sleep like a baby .
 Will you wake me .
 Of course .
 Good .
 said the traveler , lifting himself up on his elbows .
 Two leagues past the top of the hill .
 The rider who had come from the chateau and the tired horse continued through the village .
 They galloped up the stony hill to the prison on the cliff .
 At the gate , a group of officers was looking at the fire , and a little ways off was a group of soldiers .
 Help , officers .
 The chateau is on fire .
 We might be able to save valuable objects from the flames if we work fast .
 Help .
 Help .
 The officers looked at the soldiers , who were looking at the fire .
 They didn't give any orders , just shrugged and answered , It has to burn .
 Less than a hundred miles away , there were other fires burning and other local officials who weren't as lucky as Monsieur Gabelle .
 That night and other nights , when the sun rose , these officials were found hanging in the once-peaceful streets , where they had been born and raised .
 Also , there were other villagers and townspeople less fortunate than the repairer of roads and his companions , whom the officials and soldiers defeated and hanged .
 Regardless , the four fierce figures who had lit the fire were steadily making their way in four different directionseast , west , north , and southand wherever someone was hanged , fire burned .
 How many people would have to die to satisfy them no official could say .
 Three years went by , and the violence in France grew worse and worse without stop , while the people around it watched in terror and wonder .
 Little Lucie Manette had three more birthdays in her peaceful home .
 August 1792 had come , and the upper class of monseigneurs had by this time fled to many different places .
 Even though you are as youthful as the youngest man that ever lived , said Charles Darnay , hesitating , I still have to suggest to you .
 I understand .
 I am too old .
 said MrLorry .
 You will face bad weather , a long journey , unreliable means of traveling , a country in turmoil , and a city that might not even be safe for you .
 Really .
 You're one to talk .
 said MrLorry .
 You wish you were going yourself .
 You're a Frenchman .
 You're a smart adviser , aren't you .
 When you were talking to Lucie , MrLorry repeated .
 Yes .
 I'm amazed that you're not ashamed to mention her name .
 Wishing you were going to France .
 However , I'm not going , said Charles Darnay , with a smile .
 The point is that you say you're going .
 How I admire your bravery and youthful spirit , MrLorry .
 Tut .
 Nonsense , sir .
 And , my dear Charles , said MrLorry , glancing at the head of the bank again , remember that getting anything out of Paris right now , no matter what it is , is almost impossible .
 Some papers and important matters were brought here just today by the strangest people you could imagine , all of whom could have been seized and had their heads chopped off as they passed through the barriers out of France .
 I'm telling you this in secretit is unprofessional for me to whisper about it , even to you .
  Any other time our packages would come and go as easily as they would here in England .
 Now , everything has stopped .
 And are you really leaving tonight .
 And you aren't taking anyone with you .
 Many different people have been suggested to me , but I don't want any of them .
 I plan to take Jerry .
 Jerry has been my bodyguard on Sunday nights for a long time and I'm used to him .
 Nobody will suspect Jerry of being anything but an English ruffian , or of having any idea in his head but to attack anyone who harms me .
 I have to say again that I admire your bravery and youthfulness .
 I say again that's nonsense .
 When I have completed this little task , maybe I will accept Tellson's offer to retire and live the easy life .
 I'll have enough time then to think about growing old .
 On the morning Charles and Lucie got married , Dr .
 Manette had made one request of Darnay : that the secret of Darnay's real name should be kept between the two of them , unless the doctor decided otherwise .
 Nobody else knew that it was Darnay's name .
 Even Charles's wife , Lucie , had no idea about it , and MrLorry couldn't know .
 No , said MrLorry , answering the head of the bank .
 I think I have asked everybody here , and no one can tell me where to find this gentleman .
 He's the nephew , I believe , or at least the unworthy successor , of the elegant marquis who was murdered , said one of them .
 I'm happy to say I never knew him .
 He was infected with new thought , said a third , looking at the address though a magnifying glass .
 He opposed the last marquis , abandoned the estates when he inherited them , and left them to the peasants .
 I hope the peasants will pay him back as he deserves .
 Hey .
 yelled Stryver .
 Did he .
 Is that the kind of man he is .
 Let's look at his infamous name .
 Damn the fellow .
 I know the man .
 Do you , by Jupiter .
 said Stryver .
 I'm sorry to hear that .
 Why .
 Why , MrDarnay .
 Didn't you hear what he did .
 Don't ask why in these times .
 But I am asking why .
 I understand how to win an argument , MrDarnay , said the bullying MrStryver .
 And I'll do it .
 If this fellow is a gentleman , I don't understand him .
 You can tell him so with my compliments .
 You can also tell him from me that after he gave up his property and title to this mob of butchers , I'm surprised he's not leading the mob himself .
 But , no , gentlemen , said Stryver , looking around and snapping his fingers , I know something about human nature , and I tell you that you'll never find a man like this man trusting the peasants he claims to sympathize with .
 No , gentlemen , he'll always turn and run away very early in a fight .
 With those words , MrStryver snapped his fingers a last time and shoved his way out into Fleet Street .
 The group around him who had been listening cheered and applauded , and MrLorry and Charles Darnay were left alone at the desk as the bank emptied out .
 Will you take the letter .
 said MrLorry .
 You know where to deliver it .
 I do .
 Will you explain that we think it was addressed here in the hopes that we would know where to forward it , and that it has been here for quite some time .
 I will .
 Are you leaving for Paris from here .
 From here at eight o'clock .
 I will come back to see you off .
 To monsieur formerly known as the marquis .
 Oh .
 You , the former marquis , where are you .
 I yell out in my sleep ëWhere is he .
 ' I ask Heaven if you will come and help me .
 But there is no answer .
 Oh , you , the former marquis , I have sent this message across the sea , hoping that you will find it at Tellson's Bank and help me .
 From this horrible prison , where every hour brings me closer to my death , I pledge my sad faith , former marquis .
 Your suffering servant .
 Gabelle .
 This started to persuade Charles Darnay that he needed to go back to Paris .
 He made his decision .
 He had to go to Paris .
 He walked back and forth thinking , until it was time to go back to Tellson's and send off MrLorry .
 As soon as he arrived in Paris he would find MrLorry again , but he wouldn't say anything about his plans now .
 A carriage with post horses was waiting at the door of the bank , and Jerry was there dressed and ready .
 I have delivered that letter , said Charles Darnay to MrLorry .
 I wouldn't let him give me a written answer , but will you take a verbal answer .
 I will , happily , said MrLorry , if it's not dangerous .
 And what is the message to the unlucky prisoner Gabelle .
 It's simply that ëhe has received the letter and will come .
 At a specific time .
 He will leave tomorrow night .
 Any particular person .
 No .
 It was the fourteenth of August , and that night Darnay sat up late and wrote two passionate letters .
 One was to Lucie , explaining his need to go to Paris and assuring her that he would not come to any harm there .
 The other letter was to the doctor , telling him to take care of Lucie and their daughter , and reassuring him as well that he would be fine .
 To both of them he wrote that he would send them letters to let them know he was safe as soon as he arrived .
 The magnet was drawing him quickly back to France now , and the winds and tides were heading toward it .
 He left his two letters with a trustworthy porter and told him to deliver them half an hour before midnight , but no sooner .
 He took a horse to Dover and started his journey .
 For the love of Heaven , justice , generosity , and of the honor of your family name .
 was what Gabelle , the poor prisoner , had said .
 Darnay recalled these words , which gave him strength as he left all that he loved on earth behind him , and sailed back toward France .
 The end of Book Two .
 Charles Darnay had only traveled a few leagues into France when he began to notice that there was no hope of his going back until he had been declared a good citizen in Paris .
 Whatever might happen to him now , he had to continue on to his destination .
 He knew that every village and barrier he passed through was another obstacle between him and England .
 He was watched so carefully that he wouldn't have felt more like a prisoner even if he had been caught in a net , or were being sent to his destination in a cage .
 If he hadn't shown them poor Gabelle's letter from Abbaye Prison , he would not have gotten that far .
 He had so much trouble at the guardhouse in this small town that he thought he was in danger .
 Because of this he was especially surprised when he was woken up in the small inn where he was staying in the middle of the night .
 Emigrant , said the official , I am going to send you to Paris with an escort .
 Citizen , I want nothing more than to get to Paris , though I don't need an escort .
 Quiet .
 said one of the men in the red caps , hitting the bedcover with the handle of his musket .
 Quiet , aristocrat .
 I have no choice , said Charles Darnay .
 Choice .
 Listen to him .
 yelled the same angry man in the red cap .
 As if we weren't doing him a favor by keeping him from being hanged from a streetlamp .
 What this patriot says is always right , said the official .
 Get up and get dressed , emigrant .
 You call me an emigrant , my friends .
 Don't you see that I'm here in France by my own choice .
 The postmaster got between the man and the rider's bridle , which is what the man was apparently moving toward .
 He said soothingly , Leave him alone .
 He will be judged in Paris .
 He lies .
 yelled the farrier .
 He is a traitor since they made the decree .
 His cursed life doesn't belong to him anymore .
 His life belongs to the people of France .
 What decree was the smith talking about .
 Darnay asked the postmaster after he had thanked him and stood next to him in the yard .
 It's a decree for selling property of emigrants .
 When was it passed .
 On the fourteenth .
 That's the day I left England .
 Everybody says it is just one of many , and that there will be more decrees , if there aren't already , that will banish all emigrants and condemn them to death if they return .
 That's what he meant when he said your life is no longer your own .
 But there are no decrees like that yet .
 At daylight they were finally at the walls of Paris .
 The barrier was closed and guarded by many men when they rode up to it .
 Where are the prisoner's papers .
 asked a resolute-looking man in charge , who was called out by the guard .
 After Darnay had waited on his horse for half an hour noticing these things , the same man in charge came out and told the guard to open the barrier .
 Then he gave the drunken sober escorts a receipt for Darnay and asked Darnay to get down off his horse .
 He did so , and the two escorts , leading Darnay's tired horse , turned and rode away without entering the city .
 Citizen Defarge , the officer said to the guard escorting Darnay as he took out a slip of paper to write on .
 Is this the emigrant Evremonde .
 This is the man .
 How old are you , Evremonde .
 Thirty-seven .
 Are you married , Evremonde .
 Yes .
 Where were you married .
 In England .
 Of course you were .
 Where is your wife , Evremonde .
 She is in England .
 Of course she is .
 You will be sent to La Force Prison , Evremonde .
 By Heaven .
 exclaimed Darnay .
 Under what law , and for what crime .
 The officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment .
 We have new laws , Evremonde , and new crimes , since you were last in France .
 He smiled cruelly as he said it and continued writing .
 Defarge gestured to Darnay with the paper that he had to follow him .
 Darnay obeyed , and two armed citizens went with them .
 Yes , answered Darnay , with a surprised look .
 My wife came to your house to take back her father .
 Yes .
 The word wife caused Defarge to say suddenly , In the name of that new invention called the guillotine , why did you come back to France .
 You heard me say it a minute ago .
 You don't believe it's the truth .
 It's a bad truth for you , said Defarge , speaking with a frown and looking straight ahead .
 Truly I feel lost here .
 Everything is so new , so different , so sudden and unjust , that I feel lost .
 Can you help me .
 No .
 Defarge kept looking straight ahead as he spoke .
 Will you answer one question for me .
 Maybe .
 Depending on what it is .
 What is it .
 In this prison that I am going to so unjustly , will I have some way of communicating with the outside world .
 You'll see .
 Am I going to be shut up there without a trial or any chance to present my case .
 You'll see .
 But , what then .
 Other people have been shut up in worse prisons before in the same way .
 But not by me , Citizen Defarge .
 Defarge looked at him for an answer .
 He walked steadily on in silence , and the quieter he became , the less Darnay hoped that Defarge might soften .
 Therefore , he said quickly : 
 I will do nothing for you , said Defarge , stubbornly .
 My duty is to my country and its people .
 I have sworn to serve them against people like you .
 I will do nothing for you .
 Charles Darnay felt that it was hopeless to beg him anymore , and he was also too proud to do so .
 As they walked on in silence , he couldn't help noticing how the people seemed to be used to seeing prisoners moving through the streets .
 Even the children barely noticed him .
 A few people passing by turned to look at him , and a few shook their fingers at him for being an aristocrat .
 But otherwise , the fact that a well-dressed man was going to prison was no more special than if a man in work clothes should be going to work .
 In one narrow , dark , and dirty street that they passed through , an excited speaker was standing on a stool and speaking to an excited audience about crimes against the people of the king and the royal family .
 The few words that Charles Darnay heard the man say let him know that the king was in prison and that all the foreign ambassadors had left Paris .
 Except for when he had been in Beauvais , he had heard no news on the road .
 His escort and the fact that he was so closely watched had isolated him .
 He knew now that France was a much more dangerous place for him currently than it had been when he had left England .
 He knew that danger had come upon him quickly and that things might get more and more dangerous for him .
 He had to admit to himself that he might not have come if he had known what would happen .
 And yet his concerns weren't as ominous as you would think , looking back on it from this happier time .
 Troubled as his future was , he didn't know his future .
 He knew so little about the coming massacrea horrible massacre that would go on for days and nights and that would taint the gathering time of the harvest with bloodshedit could have been a hundred thousand years away .
 The new invention of the guillotine was hardly known by name to him , or the people of France .
 The terrible things that would soon be done probably didn't even exist in the minds of the people who would do them yet .
 How could gentle people imagine such things .
 What the devil .
 How many more of them are there .
 exclaimed the man with the swollen face .
 I say again , what the devil .
 exclaimed the jailer to his wife .
 How many more .
 In secret , too , complained the jailer , reading the slip of paper .
 As if the prison wasn't already full to bursting .
 Come .
 said the chief , finally picking up his keys , come with me , emigrant .
 Darnay withdrew from these people instinctively , associating prisoners with crime and disgrace .
 But the greatest unreality of his long ride was now their in front of him , as he saw the refinement and grace of these prisoners , who were all members of the upper class .
 These refined manners seemed so out of place in the gloom of the prison that Charles Darnay felt as if he were surrounded by ghosts .
 These ghosts of beauty , stateliness , elegance , pride , frivolity , wit , youth , and age were all waiting here to leave earth .
 They all looked at him with eyes that had been changed by the death they had died in being imprisoned there .
 Charles Darnay revived himself and told him the information as well as he could .
 I don't understand the meaning of the phrase , but I heard them say that I was .
 The group murmured sympathetically as Charles Darnay walked across the room to a grated door , where the jailer waited for him .
