 They were both silent . 
 You have had a long life to look back on , sir ? said Carton thoughtfully . 
 I am seventy-eight years old . 
 You have worked hard all your life . You have always been busy . You are trusted , respected , and looked up to ? 
 I have been a businessman ever since I became a man . I was even a businessman when I was still a boy . 
 Look at what you are doing at the age of seventy-eight . How many people will miss you when you die ! 
 I am a lonely , old bachelor , answered Mr . Lorry , shaking his head . Nobody will weep for me when I die . 
 How can you say that ? Wouldn't Lucie weep for you ? Wouldn't her daughter ? 
 Yes , yes . Thank God . I didn't mean exactly what I said . 
 It is something to thank God for , isn't it ? 
 Of course . 
 If you could say truthfully tonight , ëNo one has any love , attachment , gratitude , or respect for me . No one thinks of me tenderly . I have done nothing good or helpful to be remembered by ! ' the years you have lived would be a curse instead of a blessing , wouldn't they ? 
 That's true , Mr . Carton . I think they would be . 
 Sydney looked at the fire again . After sitting in silence for a few moments , he said : 
 I want to ask you . Does your childhood seem like it was a long time ago ? Do the days when you sat at your mother's knee seem like a long time ago ? 
 Mr . Lorry could see that Carton had softened . He answered : 
 Twenty years ago , yes . But at this time of my life , no , it doesn't . As I get closer and closer to death , it's as if I was traveling in a circle and moving nearer and nearer to the beginning . It seems to be one of the kind ways we prepare ourselves for death . I now remember fondly many memories that I had forgotten for a long time . Memories of my pretty mother and the times when I was young . Times when the world didn't seem so harsh to me and I didn't know my own faults . 
 I understand that feeling ! exclaimed Carton , blushing . And you are the better for it ? 
 I hope so . 
 Carton ended the conversation then by getting up to help Mr . Lorry put his coat on . But youyou are young , said Mr . Lorry , returning to the subject . 
 Yes , said Carton . I am not old , but my youthful behavior was not a good way to age . Enough about me . 
 And enough about me , said Mr . Lorry . Are you going out ? 
 I'll walk with you to Lucie's gate . You know my wandering and restless habits . If I roam the streets for a long time , don't worry . I will come back in the morning . You are going to the court tomorrow ? 
 Yes , unfortunately . 
 I'll be there , but only as a member of the crowd . Barsad will find a place for me . Take my arm , sir . 
 Mr . Lorry took his arm , and they went downstairs and out into the streets . In a few minutes they were at Mr . Lorry's destination . Carton left him there , but he waited a little ways off . When the gate was shut again he went back and touched it . He had heard that Lucie went to stand outside the prison every day . She came out here , he said , looking around him . She turned this way . She must have walked on these cobblestones often . Let me follow her steps . 
 It was ten o'clock at night when he arrived in front of La Force Prison , where she had stood hundreds of times . A little wood sawyer had closed up his shop and was smoking his pipe in the shop door . 
 Good evening , citizen , said Sydney Carton . He paused as he went by , for the man was looking at him curiously . 
 Good evening , citizen . 
 How's the Republic doing ? 
 You mean the guillotine . Not bad . Sixty-three people killed today . We will make it to a hundred soon . The executioner , Samson , and his men complain sometimes of being exhausted . Ha , ha , ha ! He's funny , that Samson . Such a barber wielding our National Razor ! 
 Do you go to see executions at the guillotine very often ? 
 Do I see people getting ëa shave' ? Always . Every day . He's quite the barber . You've seen him at work ? 
 Never . 
 Go and see him when he has a good group of prisoners . Think about this , citizen . He killed sixty-three people today , in less time than it took me to smoke two pipes . Less than two pipes ! I swear ! 
 The grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking to show how he had timed the executioner . Carton wanted to beat the man to death so badly that he turned away from him . 
 But you are not English , although you dress like an Englishman ? asked the wood sawyer . 
 Yes , said Carton . He paused again and answered over his shoulder . 
 You speak like a Frenchman . 
 I studied a long time here . 
 Ah-ha , you're like a perfect Frenchman ! Good night , Englishman . 
 Good night , citizen . 
 But go and see the executioner , the little man continued , yelling after him . And take a pipe with you ! 
 Sydney had not gone far out of sight when he stopped in the middle of the street under a shining streetlamp . He wrote something down in pencil on a scrap of paper , then walked through several dark and dirty streets with the confidence of a man who remembered the way well . The streets were dirtier than usual , as even the best roads weren't cleaned during those violent times . He stopped at a chemist's shop , which was just closing up . The shop was located on a main road that went up a steep hill . It was small , dark , and crooked , and a small , dark , and crooked man owned it . 
 He said good evening to the shopkeeper , too , as he went up to the counter . He put the scrap of paper in front of him . Whew ! the chemist whistled softly as he read it . Hi , hi , hi ! 
 Sydney Carton ignored him . The chemist said : 
 This is for you , citizen ? 
 It's for me . 
 You'll make sure to keep them separate , citizen ? You know what will happen if you mix them . 
 I know perfectly well . 
 The chemist made up some small packets and gave them to Mr . Carton , who put them in the breast pocket of his inner coat one by one . He counted out the money for them , paid the shopkeeper , and left the shop quickly . There is nothing more I can do until tomorrow , he said , looking up at the moon . I can't sleep . 
 He said this aloud under the clouds that were moving quickly across the sky . He didn't say these words casually . He said them defiantly . He had the determination of a tired man who had wandered and struggled and gotten lost , but who had finally found the right path and saw the end in sight . 
 Long ago , when Carton had been famous among his early competitors as a young man with a great future ahead of him , his father had died . His mother had died years earlier . Now he thought of the solemn words that he had read at his father's grave as he walked down the dark streets covered with shadows . The moon and clouds sailed high above him . He thought , I am the resurrection and the life , says the Lord . Whoever believes in me that is dead will live again . Whoever lives and believes in me will never die . 
 Mr . Carton was alone at night in Paris , which was dominated by the guillotine . He was feeling sympathy for the sixty-three people who had been executed that day and sympathy for the people now in prison who would be executed tomorrow . There were many reasons to think about these words , and he repeated them and walked on . 
 He looked at the lit windows where people were going to sleep and could forget the horrible things happening around them for a few calm hours . He looked at the towers of the churches where no one was praying , for the people were even disgusted by religion after years of corruption by thieves , vagrants , and people acting as priests . He looked at the graveyards far away reserved for eternal sleep , as it was written on the graveyard gates . He looked at the surrounding jails and the streets along which the sixty or so condemned people were carried in carts to their deaths . This had become so common that no one even made up ghost stories about the people killed at the guillotine . He thought about the lives and deaths of everyone in Paris as they all settled down to sleep . Then Sydney Carton crossed the Seine River again and headed for better-lit streets . 
 There weren't many coaches in the streets , as people riding in coaches were often suspected . The higher classes hid among the peasants by wearing red caps and heavy shoes and walking with everyone else , but the theaters were full . As he walked past , people poured out of them cheerfully and went home , talking together . At one of the theater doors there was a little girl with her mother . They were looking for a way to cross the street through the mud . Sydney carried the child across the street . Before she had let go of his neck , he asked her for a kiss . 
 I am the resurrection and the life , says the Lord . Whoever believes in me , even though he is dead , he shall live . And whoever lives and believes in me shall never die . 
 Now that the streets were quiet and the night continued on , the words echoed around him . He was completely calm and steady . Sometimes he repeated them out loud to himself as he walked , but he heard them continuously in his head . 
 Then the night was over . He stood on a bridge listening to the water as it splashed against the river walls of the island of Paris . A beautiful cluster of houses and a cathedral shone in the moonlight . The day came on coldly , looking like a dead person's face in the sky . Then the night , with the moon and the stars , turned pale and faded away , and for a little while it seemed like death had taken over the whole world . 
 Then the glorious sun rose and it was daylight . It warmed Sydney's heart with its long , bright rays . As he shaded his eyes with his hand and looked at the sunshine , it looked like there was a bridge of light between him and the sun , and the river sparkled below it . 
 The tide was strong and fast and always there , like a friend in the stillness of the morning . He walked by the stream , far away from the houses , and fell asleep on the riverbank in the light and warmth of the sun . Then he woke up and stood there a little longer . He watched a whirlpool in the stream that turned and turned without purpose until the stream absorbed it and carried it out to sea . Like me , thought Sydney . 
 A trading boat glided into view . Its sail was the color of a dead leaf , and it floated by him and died away . As the track of water that it made disappeared , the prayer he had been repeating to himself asking mercy for all his faults and mistakes ended with the words , I am the resurrection and the life . 
 Mr . Lorry was already out when he got back . It was easy to guess where he had gone . Sydney Carton drank nothing but a little coffee and ate some bread . After he washed up and changed clothes to refresh himself , he went to Darnay's trial . 
 The court was full of noise and activity , when the court officials , whom many moved away from in fear , pushed him into a corner of the crowd . Mr . Lorry was there , and so was Dr . Manette . Lucie was there , sitting next to her father . 
 Lucie turned to look at Darnay when he was brought in . She was supportive , encouraging , and full of love and tenderness , and she was being so brave for his sake that it made him blush . It brightened his glance and made his heart beat fast . If anyone had noticed how her appearance changed Sydney Carton , they would have noticed that the exact same look was now on his face , too . 
 There was hardly any order of procedure at the unjust tribunal that assured an accused person of receiving a fair hearing . The Revolution had eliminated all of the laws , formalities , and ceremonies of the government , the terrible abuse of which caused the Revolution in the first place . 
 Everyone looked at the jury . The same patriots and republicans were on the jury that had been there the day before and would still be there the day after . There was one man among them who seemed important and eager . He had a greedy look on his face , and his fingers were constantly moving around his lips . The crowd was very happy to see him , and he looked thirsty for blood as if he were a cannibal . He was Jacques Three from Saint Antoine . The whole jury was as hungry as a jury of dogs brought together to put a deer on trial . 
 Everyone turned to look at the five judges and the public prosecutor . No one among them looked sympathetic . They all looked vicious and murderous . Then everyone looked at the other people in the crowd , and the all nodded their heads approvingly to each other before they leaned forward attentively . 
 The prosecutor stated Darnay's case . His name was Charles Evremonde , also known as Darnay . He was released yesterday . He was reaccused and taken in custody again yesterday . The formal accusation was delivered to him last night . He is suspected and denounced as an enemy of the Republic . He is an aristocrat . He comes from a family of tyrants who have been banned for using their power to oppress the peasants . Charles Evremonde , also known as Darnay , has been banned by the law and should definitely be sentenced to death . 
 In this way , in as few words or fewer , the public prosecutor pronounced his sentence . 
 The president asked if Darnay had been denounced openly or secretly . 
 The prosecutor answered , Openly , president . 
 By whom ? asked the president . 
 By three people . Ernest Defarge , a wine seller from Saint Antoine , answered the prosecutor . 
 Good . 
 Therese Defarge , his wife . 
 Good . 
 Dr . Alexandre Manette . 
 The crowd in the courtroom roared . Dr . Manette could be seen in the middle of the crowd , pale and trembling . He had stood up where he had been sitting . 
 President , I protest that this is a forgery and a fraud . You know that Darnay is my daughter's husband . My daughter , and those she loves , are much more important to me than my own life . Who and where is the liar who says that I denounced my daughter's husband ! 
 Calm down , Citizen Manette . To speak out of turn against the authority of the tribunal is breaking the law . Regarding what is more important to you than your life , nothing can be as important to a good citizen as the Republic . 
 People cheered loudly at this , and the president rang his bell and continued . 
 If the Republic demanded that you give up even your own child , you would have to sacrifice her . Listen to what will follow . In the meantime , be quiet ! 
 The crowd shouted again , and Dr . Manette sat down . He looked around him . His lips were trembling , and Lucie pulled closer to him . Jacques Three in the jury rubbed his hands together and brought his hand to his mouth as usual . 
 Defarge came forward . When the court was quiet enough for him to be heard , he quickly told the story of Manette's imprisonment and how Defarge had been a servant of Dr . Manette when he was just a boy . He told them about Manette's release , and about the state he was in when he was released and brought to the attic in Saint Antoine . This short examination came next , as the court was quick with its work : 
 You did good work at the taking of the Bastille , Citizen Defarge ? 
 I believe so . 
 At this , an excited woman yelled from the crowd , You were one of the best patriots there . Why not say so ? You were firing a cannon that day . You were among the first to enter the accursed Bastille when it fell . Patriots , I'm telling the truth ! 
 It was The Vengeance who was yelling . The crowd cheered warmly along with her , and the president rang his bell . But The Vengeance , feeling encouraged , shrieked , I defy that bell ! and the crowd cheered her again . 
 Tell the tribunal what you did at the Bastille that day , Citizen Defarge . 
 Defarge looked down at his wife . She stood at the bottom of the steps where he was standing , looking up at him steadily . I knew that this prisoner , Manette , had been held in the cell known as One Hundred and Five , North Tower . He told me so himself . He only knew himself by the name One Hundred and Five , North Tower , when he was in my care and still making shoes . While I was firing my cannon that day , I decided that when the fortress fell I would examine that cell . The Bastille fell and I went up to the cell with another citizen who is on the jury , directed by the jailer . I examined it very closely . There was a hole in the chimney where a stone had been pulled out and replaced . In it I found a paper with writing on it . This is that piece of paper . I have made it my business to examine other examples of Dr . Manette's writing . This is Dr . Manette's handwriting . I give this paper , written by Dr . Manette , to the president . 
 Let it be read . 
 Everything was dead silent and still . Darnay looked lovingly at his wife . His wife would only look away from him to look at her father with concern . Dr . Manette kept looking at the reader . Madame Defarge never looked away from Darnay , and Defarge never looked away from his wife . Everyone else looked at the doctor intently , but the doctor didn't notice any of them . The paper was read , as follows . 
 I , Alexandre Manette , an unfortunate doctor , born in Beauvais and later a resident of Paris , am writing this paper in my cell in the Bastille in December 1767 . I write it a few moments at a time , under very difficult conditions . I plan to hide it in the wall of the chimney , where I have slowly and with much difficulty made a hiding place for it . Someone might find it there when my sorrows and I have both died away . 
 I write these words with a rusty iron point and with bits of soot and charcoal from the chimney , mixed with my blood . This is December of the tenth year I have been in prison . I have no hope left . I know from warning signs I have seen in myself that I will soon lose my sense of reason , but I swear that at the moment I am in my right mind , that my memory is sharp . As these will be my last written words I swear that what I write is the truth , whether my words are ever read by men on earth or by God on the day of Judgment . 
 One cloudy moonlit night in the third week of December 1757 (I think it was December 22nd) , I was walking on a secluded part of the quay by the Seine River to get some fresh air . I was an hour away from my home on the Street of the School of Medicine when a carriage came up behind me moving very quickly . As I stood aside to let the carriage go by , fearing that it might run me over otherwise , someone put his head out of the window and a voice called to the driver to stop . 
 The carriage stopped as soon as the driver could slow down the horses , and the same voice called to me by name . I answered . The carriage was so far ahead of me by then that the two gentlemen had time to open the door and get out before I came up to it . 
 I saw that they were both wrapped up in cloaks and appeared to hide themselves . As they stood side by side near the carriage door , I could also see that they both looked to be about my age , or a bit younger . They looked very much alike in size , behavior , and voice and , as far as I could see , in face too . 
 ëYou are Dr . Manette ? ' said one . 
 I am . 
 ëDr . Manette from Beauvais , ' said the other . ëThe young doctor who was an expert surgeon and who has built a good reputation for himself here in Paris in the last year or two ? 
 ëGentlemen , ' I answered , ëI am the man that you speak of so kindly . '
 ëWe have been to your house , ' said the first man . ëWe didn't find you there and were told that you were probably walking in this direction . We followed you , hoping to catch up . Will you please get in our carriage ? '
 They were both intimidating . As they said this , they both moved so that I was between them and the carriage door . They were armed , and I was not . 
 ëExcuse me , gentlemen , ' I said , ëbut I usually ask who is seeking my help and what the patient's illness is . '
 The man who had spoken second answered this . ëDoctor , the clients who need your help are important people . We are confident in your skills and are sure you can decide for yourself what the illness is better than we can describe it . Enough . Will you please get in the carriage ? '
 I could do nothing but obey , and I got into the carriage in silence . They both got in after me , the last one in jumped in after putting up the steps . The carriage turned around and drove on as fast as before . 
 I repeat the conversation that followed exactly as it occurred . I have no doubt that it is , word for word , the same . I describe everything exactly as it happened and force my mind to stay focused on the task . The broken marks that follow indicate where I stopped writing for the moment and returned my paper to its hiding place . 
 ***
 The carriage drove beyond the city streets , passed the north barrier , and came out onto a country road . At two-thirds of a league away from the barrier , the carriage left the main road and soon stopped at a secluded house . I didn't estimate the distance then but did so afterward when I returned . The three of us got out and walked along a damp , soft path in a garden , where a neglected fountain had overflowed , to the door of the house . When they rang the bell , the door did not open right away . When a servant finally opened it , one of the two men with me slapped the servant across the face with his riding glove . 
 There was nothing unusual about this , as I had seen common people hit more often than dogs . But the second of the two men , who was also angry , hit the man in the face with his arm . Their look and behavior was so exactly alike that this was when I first noticed they were twin brothers . 
 The outer gate had been locked , and one of the brothers opened it to let us in and then locked it again . From the time we had gotten out of the carriage at the outer gate I heard cries coming from a room upstairs . I was taken straight to this room , and the cries grew louder as we climbed the stairs . I found a patient with a high fever of the brain lying on a bed . 
 The patient was a beautiful young woman , not much more than twenty years old . Her hair was torn and ragged , and her arms were tied to her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs . I noticed that these ties were all pieces of a gentleman's wardrobe . On one of them , which was a fringed ceremonial scarf , I saw the coat of arms of a noble family and the letter E . 
 I saw this in the first minute of examining the patient . In her twisting and turning she had turned over on her face on the edge of the bed . She had taken the end of the scarf in her mouth and was in danger of suffocating . The first thing I did was to reach out my hand to help her breathe , and in moving aside the scarf , I saw the embroidered coat of arms . 
 I turned her over gently and placed my hands on her chest to calm her and keep her down . I looked into her face . Her eyes were dilated and wild , and she was screaming constantly . She repeated the words , ëMy husband , my father , and my brother ! ' Then she would count to twelve and say ëHush ! ' She would pause and listen for just a moment , then she would would repeat the cry , ëMy husband , my father , and my brother ! ' and count up to twelve and say ëHush ! ' This was always exactly the same . Except for her regular pauses , she never stopped saying these words . 
 ëHow long has she been doing this ? ' I asked . 
 To distinguish between the two brothers , I will call them the older and the younger . By the older , I mean the one that seemed to be in charge . It was the older brother who replied , ëSince about this time last night . '
 ëShe has a husband , a father , and a brother ? '
 ëShe has a brother . '
 ëYou are not her brother ? '
 He answered with great contempt , ëNo . '
 ëShe has some recent connection with the number twelve ? '
 The younger brother impatiently joined in , ëDo you mean with twelve o'clock ? '
 ëSee , gentlemen , ' I said , keeping my hands on her chest , ëI am useless as you have brought me ! If I had known what I was coming to see , I could have brought what I needed . As it is , we must lose more time . There is nowhere to find medicine out here in this lonely place . '
 The older brother looked at the younger brother . He said haughtily , ëThere is a case full of medicine here . ' He took the case out of a closet and put it on the table . 
 * * *
 I opened some of the bottles , smelled them , and put the stoppers to my lips . I wouldn't have used any of them unless I wanted to narcotics that were poisons in themselves . 
 ëDo you think they won't work ? ' asked the younger brother . 
 You see , monsieur , I'm going to use them , ' I replied , and said no more . 
 After trying very hard several times , I made the patient swallow the dose I wanted her to take . I planned to do the same thing again after a while . I needed to watch how it affected her , so I sat down by the side of the bed . There was a nervous , fearful peasant woman there who was the wife of the man downstairs . She had retreated into a corner . The house was damp and falling apart , and it was furnished indifferently , suggesting it had only recently been occupied and only used temporarily . Some thick tapestries had been nailed up over the windows to deaden the sounds of the woman's screams . She continued to scream constantly and to cry out , My husband , my father , and my brother ! Then she would count up to twelve and say ëHush ! ' Her fit was so violent that I didn't untie the bandages restraining her arms . But I looked at them to make sure they weren't hurting her . The only encouraging thing about her case was that when I placed my hands on her chest it seemed to calm her for a few minutes . It didn't stop the screams , which happened as regularly as the swinging of a pendulum . 
 Since I assumed that my hand was calming her , I sat by her bedside for half an hour while the two brothers looked on . Then the older brother said : 
 ëThere is another patient . '
 I was surprised . I asked , ëIs it a serious case ? '
 ëYou'd better see for yourself , ' he answered carelessly , and picked up a lantern . 
 ***
 The other patient was lying in a back room across a second staircase . It was a kind of loft over a stable . There was a low plastered ceiling over part of it , and the rest of it was open to the edge of the tiled roof . There were beams across it . Hay and straw were stored in that part of it , as well as small pieces of firewood and piles of apples stored in sand . I had to walk through that part to get to the other side of the room . My memory is sharp , and I challenge it with these details . Here in my cell in the Bastille I see them all as clearly as I saw them that night . 
 A handsome peasant boy was lying on his back on some hay on the ground , with a cushion under his head . The boy wasn't older than seventeen . His teeth were clenched , his right hand was grabbing his chest , and his eyes were staring straight up . I couldn't see where his wound was as I kneeled over him on one knee , but I could see he was dying of a stab wound . 
 ëI am a doctor , my poor fellow , ' I said . ëLet me examine it . '
 ëI don't want you to examine it , ' he answered . ëLeave it alone . '
 The wound was under his hand . I calmed him and he let me move his hand away . The wound had come from the thrust of a sword , done twenty to twenty-four hours earlier . But no one could have saved him even it had been looked at right away . He was dying fast . As I looked at the older brother I saw him looking down at this handsome dying boy as if he were a wounded bird , or a rabbit , not at all like a fellow human . 
 ëHow did this happen , monsieur ? ' I asked one of the brothers . 
 ëHe's a crazy young peasant ! A serf ! He forced my brother to draw his sword on him , and he has been wounded by my brother's swordlike a gentleman . '
 There was no hint of pity , sorrow , or humanity in his answer . He seemed to admit that it was inconvenient to have a peasant dying there and that it would have been better if he had died unnoticed , as peasants usually did . He was unable to feel any compassion for the dying boy . 
 The boy had looked at the brother slowly as he spoke . Now he slowly looked at me . 
 ëDoctor , these nobles are very proud . But sometimes we peasants are proud , too . They steal from us , anger us , beat us , and kill us . But sometimes we still have a little pride left . Shehave you seen her , doctor ? '
 The screams and cries could be heard there , although they were quieter and in the distance . The boy referred to them as if she were lying there near us . 
 I said , ëI have seen her . '
 ëShe is my sister , Doctor . They have taken their right as nobles and have had their way with our sisters and peasant women for many years . But we have good girls among us . I know it and have heard my father say so . My sister was a good girl . She was engaged to a good young man too , a serf that belonged to this noble . We were all serfs that belonged to himthat man standing there . The other man is his brother . He is the worst of all of this terrible family . '
 It was very difficult for the boy to find the strength to speak . But he spoke with a dreadful passion . 
 ëWe were robbed by that man standing there , the way all peasants are robbed by nobles . We were taxed mercilessly and forced to work for him without pay . We were forced to grind our corn at his mill and forced to feed our poor crops to his tame birds . We weren't allowed to keep any tame birds ourselves . We were robbed and abused so much that when we did have the luck to have a bit of meat to eat , we ate it in fear , with the door barred and the shutters closed so no one would see it and take it away from us . We were robbed , hunted , and made so poor that our father told us that it was a terrible thing to bring a child into the world . He told us that we should pray that our women would be unable to give birth and that our family would die out ! '
 I had never seen someone speak of their oppression so passionately before . I had assumed that it had to be deep down inside the peasants somewhere , but I had never seen it break out until I saw this dying boy . 
 ëNevertheless , Doctor , my sister got married . Her husband was sick at the time , the poor fellow . She married the man she loved so that she could take care of him and comfort him in our cottageour doghouse , as that man would call it . She had only been married a few weeks when that man's brother saw her and was attracted to her . He asked her husband to lend her to him . What terrible husbands are there among us ! The husband was willing enough , but my sister was good and virtuous . She hated this man's brother as much as I did . What did the two brothers do then to persuade her husband to convince her to go through with it ? '
 The boy had been staring into my eyes . He slowly turned to the brothers , and I saw in their faces that everything he said was true . The pride of the boy confronted the pride of the two brothers . Even here in the Bastille I can see the gentleman's indifference and the oppressed boy's desire for revenge . 
 ëYou know , Doctor , that these nobles have the right to harness us to carts like common dogs and drive us through the fields . So , they harnessed her husband to a cart and drove him . You know that they have the right to make us stay outside on the grounds all night keeping the frogs quiet so that the nobles' sleep isn't disturbed . They kept him out in the cold mists at night and ordered him back into a harness during the day . But he was not persuaded . No ! One day at noon he was taken out of his harness to eatif he could find anything to eat . He sobbed twelve timesonce for every stroke of the bell . Then he died in her arms . '
 Nothing could have kept the boy alive except for his determination to tell how they had been wronged . He fought back death the way he forced his right hand to remain clenched over his wound . 
 ëThen , this man gave his brother permission to have his way with her . He even helped him to take her away , despite what I know she must have told his brother . You will know what she told him soon , Doctor , if you do not know already . His brother took her away for his pleasure and enjoyment for a little while . I saw her pass me on the road . When I told everyone at home , my father's heart burst and he died . He never said a word . I took my younger sisterfor I have anothersomewhere where this man could never reach her and where , at least , she will never be his slave . Then I followed the brother here . Last night I climbed in his window . I was still a common peasant , but I had a sword in my handWhere is the loft window ? It was somewhere here ? '
 The room was growing dark to him . The world was growing narrow around him . I looked around me and saw that the hay and straw had been trampled all over the floor , as if there had been a struggle there . 
 ëMy sister heard me and ran in . I told her not to come near us until he was dead . He came in , and first he threw me some pieces of money . Then he struck at me with a whip . But I , though a common peasant , struck him hard enough to make him draw his sword . Let him break his sword , stained with my peasant blood , into as many pieces as he can . He drew to defend himself and used all his skill to stab me . '
 I had seen a few moments before that the broken sword was lying among the hay . It was a gentleman's weapon . In another place , an old sword lied on the ground . It looked like it had belonged to a soldier . 
 ëNow lift me up , Doctor . Lift me up . Where is he ? '
 ëHe is not here , ' I said , supporting the boy . I assumed he was speaking of the brother . 
 ëHe ! As proud as these nobles are , he is afraid to see me . Where is the man who was here ? Turn my face so I can see him . '
 I did so , raising the boy's head against my knee . But with a sudden surge of strength , he raised himself up completely . I had to rise too or I could not have supported him . 
 ëMarquis , ' said the boy , turned toward him with his eyes opened wide and his right hand raised . ëWhen the time comes when all things are answered for , I call you and your descendants , to the very end of your family line , to answer for them . I mark you with this cross of blood to show what I do . When the time comes when these things are to be answered for , I call your brother , the worst of your terrible family , to answer for them on his own . I mark him with this cross of blood to show what I do . '
 Twice he put his hand to the wound in his chest and drew a cross in the air with his finger . He stood for a moment with his finger still raised . As it dropped , he dropped with it , and lied down dead . 
 ***
 When I went back to the bedside of the young woman , I found her screaming exactly as she had been before . I knew that this might go on for many hours and would probably end with her death . 
 I gave her the same medicines again and sat at her bedside late through the night . Her screams never became less piercing . She never stumbled over her words or changed their order . She always said , My husband , my father , and my brother ! One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten , eleven , twelve . Hush ! '
 This went on for twenty-six hours after I had first seen her . I had come and gone twice and was sitting beside her again when she began to weaken . I did what little I could to help her calm down . Soon she sank into a stupor and lied there like she was dead . 
 It was as if the wind and rain had finally stopped after a long , frightening storm . I let go of her arms and called the peasant woman to help me adjust her and her torn dress . It was then that I realized that she was newly pregnant , and it was then that I lost what little hope I had of her recovery . 
 ëIs she dead ? ' asked the marquis , whom I will still call the older brother . He came into the room wearing the boots he had been riding his horse in . 
 ëShe's not dead , ' I said . ëBut it is likely that she will die . '
 ëThese peasants' bodies are so strong ! ' he said . He looked down at her with curiosity . 
 ëThere is great strength in sorrow and despair , ' I answered . 
 At first he laughed at my words , then he frowned . He moved a chair close to mine with his foot and ordered the peasant woman to leave . He said , quietly : 
 ëDoctor , when I found my brother in this difficult situation with these beastly peasants , I suggested that we ask for your help . You have a good reputation . As a young man who is trying to make his fortune , you are aware of your own self-interest . The things that you have seen here are not to be spoken of . '
 I listened to the patient's breathing and didn't answer . 
 ëAre you paying attention , Doctor ? '
 ëMonsieur , in my profession , the things said by a patient are always kept secret , ' I said . I was careful with my answer , because I was troubled by what I had seen and heard . 
 It was so difficult to tell if she was breathing that I carefully felt her pulse and heartbeat . She was alive , but barely . Looking around , I took my seat again . The brothers were watching me carefully . 
 ***
 It is very difficult for me to write . It is so cold , and I am so afraid of being discovered and sent to an underground cell in total darkness , that I must cut my story short . I am not confusedmy memory is still sharp , and I can remember every word that was spoken between those brothers and me . 
 She lasted for a week . Toward the end I could understand a few syllables that she said to me if I put my ear close to her lips . She asked me where she was , and I told her . She asked me who I was , and I told her . I asked her for her family name , but she wouldn't tell me . She shook her head a little on her pillow and kept her secret , as the boy had done . 
 I had no chance to ask her any questions until I had told the brothers that she was fading fast and would not live another day . Until then , although no one was ever present with us except for the peasant woman and myself , one of the brothers had always sat behind the curtain at the head of the bed when I was there . When they realized that she was going to die , though , they didn't seem to care what conversation I had with her . The thought passed through my mind that it was as if I were dying too . 
 I always noticed that their pride caused them to resent the fact that the younger brother , as I call him , had had a swordfight with a peasant , and that the peasant was just a boy . The only thing that appeared to bother them was the idea that this was degrading to their family and undignified . Whenever I looked into the younger brother's eyes , I could tell that he strongly disliked me for knowing what I had heard from the boy . He was gentler and more polite to me than the older brother was , but I could see this . I also saw that it bothered the older brother , too . 
 The young woman died two hours before midnight . By my watch it was almost the exact time that I had first seen her . I was alone with her when her sad , young head drooped gently to one side , and all her earthly suffering ended . 
 The brothers were waiting in a room downstairs , impatient to ride away . I had heard them while I was alone at the bedside hitting their boots with their riding whips and pacing up and down . 
 Is she finally dead ? asked the older brother when I went in . 
 ëShe is dead , I said . 
 ëCongratulations , brother , ' was what he said as he turned around . 
 He had offered me money before , which I had avoided taking . Now he gave me a rouleau a stack of coins wrapped in a paper cylinder rouleau of gold . I took it from him but laid it on the table . I had thought about it before and had decided not to accept anything from them . 
 ëPlease excuse me , ' I said . ëBut I can't accept this under the circumstances . '
 They looked at each other but bowed to me as I bowed to them . We parted ways without saying another word . 
 ***
 I am tired , tired , tired . I am worn down by suffering , and I can't read what I have written with this thin hand of mine . 
 Early in the morning , the rouleau had been left at my door in a little box with my name written on it . Immediately , I thought anxiously about what I should do . I decided that day to write privately to the minister telling him about the patients that I had been summoned to help and where I had gone . In other words , I told him everything . I knew what influence certain people had at court and that nobles were often beyond punishment . I expected that the matter would never be heard of , but I wanted to relieve my own mind . I had kept the matter a secret from everyone , even my wife , and I decided to say this in the letter . I had no fear of being in any real danger , but I was worried that other people might be in danger if they knew what I knew . 
 I was very busy that day and couldn't finish my letter than night . I rose much earlier than my usual time the next morning to finish it . It was the last day of the year . The finished the letter was lying in front of me when I was told that a lady had arrived and was waiting to see me . 
 ***
 I am growing more and more incapable of finishing the task I have set myself . It's so cold and so dark . My senses are so dulled and I am so dreadfully unhappy . 
 The lady was young and beautiful but didn't look like she would live long . She was very upset . She told me she was the wife of the Marquis Saint Evremonde . I realized that this was the title by which the boy had addressed the older brother , and that this was what the letter E embroidered on the scarf meant . It was clear to me that I had seen the Marquis Saint Evremonde very recently . 
 My memory is still accurate , but I cannot write down the exact words of our conversation . I suspect that I am being watched more closely than before , and I don't know when I might be watched . She had partly suspected and partly discovered the main facts of the terrible story and what part her husband had played in it . She knew that I had been brought to help , but she didn't know that the girl was dead . She told me that she had hoped to secretly show her a woman's sympathy . She had hoped to keep the wrath of Heaven from her noble family , which had long mistreated the suffering commoners . 
 She believed there was a younger sister who was still alive , and she wanted most of all to help the sister . I could only tell her that the sister existed . I knew nothing beyond that . She had come to me secretly in hopes that I could tell her their name and where they lived . To this day I don't know either . 
 ***
 These scraps of paper will get me in trouble . One of them was taken away from me yesterday , with a warning . I have to finish my story today . 
 She was a good , kind lady , and she was not happy in her marriage . How could she be ! The brother distrusted and disliked her . Everything he did was in opposition to her . She was afraid of him and afraid of her husband , too . When I led her to the door there was a child in her carriage , a pretty boy between two and three years old . 
 ëFor his sake , Doctor , ' she said , pointing to him and crying , ëI would do everything I could to make up for this . He will never enjoy his inheritance otherwise . I have a fear that if no one else pays for this wrong , one day he will have to pay for it himself . I will make it the first duty of his life to give what little I have left to this wronged family , with the compassion and sympathy of his dead mother . It's not more than the value of a few jewels , if the sister can be discovered . '
 She kissed the boy and caressed him and said , ëIt's for your own sake . You will be faithful to me , won't you , little Charles ? ' The child answered bravely , ëYes ! ' I kissed her hand and she took him in her arms , and went away caressing him . I never saw her again . 
 Since she had mentioned her husband's name as if she thought I already knew it , I did not add it to my letter . I sealed my letter . I was afraid to give it to anyone else , so I delivered it myself that same day . 
 It was December 31st . Near nine o'clock that night a man dressed in black rang the bell at my gate . He demanded to see me and quietly followed my young servant , Ernest Defarge , upstairs . When my servant came into the room where I sat with my wifeoh , my wife , I loved her ! My fair young English wife ! we saw the man , who was supposed to be waiting at the gate , standing behind him . 
 He said that there was an urgent case in the Rue Saint Honore . He said it wouldn't take long . He had a coach waiting . 
 The coach brought me here to the Bastille , where I will die . When I was away from the house , a black scarf was tied tightly over my mouth from behind and my arms were pinned . The two brothers crossed the road from a dark corner . They gestured that I was the man they were looking for . The marquis took the letter I had written out of his pocket and showed it to me . He burned it in the light of the lantern he was holding and put out the burning ashes with his foot . They didn't say a word . I was brought here to my cell . It is like a living grave . 
 If God had put it in the heart of either of the brothers , in all these frightening years , to give me any news of how my wife is doingeven just to know if she were alive or deadI might have thought that God hadn't abandoned them . But now I believe that the mark of the cross that the dying boy had made with his blood is fatal to them , and that they will not receive His mercy . I , Alexandre Manette , a sad prisoner , do tonight , December 31st , 1767 , in my unbearable suffering , denounce the Evremonde brothers and all their descendants to the last of their family , to the time when these things will be answered for . I denounce them to Heaven and Earth . 
 A terrible sound was heard when the reading of the document had finishedan eager , hungry , blood-chilling scream . The story called up the most revengeful passions of the time , and every head in all of France dropped before it . 
 There was no need , in front of that tribunal , and with that terrible sound , to show that the Defarges had hidden that paper and not made it public . That they had put it with the other items taken from the Bastille that were paraded around and had kept it , waiting for the right time . There was no need to show that the family of Evremonde had been hated for a long time by the people of Saint Antoine , and was on the list of people to be executed . There is no man alive whose virtues would have saved him against such denunciation . 
 It was that much worse for Darnay that Dr . Manette , the man who was denouncing him , was a well-known citizen , his own friend , and the father of his wife . One of the hopes of the people was to imitate the questionable virtues of ancient times and for people to sacrifice themselves for the good of the public . Therefore , the president said (or else his own head would have been in danger of being cut off) that the good doctor would help the Republic even more by destroying an obnoxious family of aristocrats , and that he would doubtlessly glow with joy and pride by making his daughter a widow and her child an orphan . At that , the crowd went wild with excitement and patriotic passion , and there was not a touch of human sympathy among them . 
 The doctor has a lot of influence , does he ? murmured Madame Defarge , smiling to The Vengeance . Let's see if you can save him now , Doctor ! 
 The crowd roared every time one of the members of the jury voted . Another and another , roar after roar . 
 The vote was unanimous . He was an aristocrat , by family and in his heart . He was an enemy of the Republic and an oppressor of the people . They voted to send him back to the Conciergerie and executed within the next twenty-four hours ! 
 Lucie fainted as the sentence was pronounced , as if she had been struck down dead . But she made no sound . The strong voice inside her reminded her that she of all people could support Charles in his misery and that she shouldn't add to it . This thought quickly awoke her from the shock . 
 The judges had to leave to take part in a public demonstration outdoors , so the tribunal adjourned . The noise and movement of people leaving the courtroom by various hallways was still going on when Lucie stood and reached out to her husband . There was nothing in the expression on her face but love and consolation . 
 If I could touch him ! If I could embrace him just once ! Oh , good citizens , will you have compassion for us ? 
 There was only one jailer left , along with two of the four men who had taken him the night before . Barsad was there , too . The people had all gone outside to the demonstration in the streets . Barsad suggested to the others , Let her embrace him . It's only for a moment . They agreed silently and helped her move over the seats in the hall to a place higher up where Darnay could embrace her by leaning over the dock the area in a law court where the accused stands during a trial dock . 
 Farewell , darling . This is the last blessing I will give you . We will meet again in Heaven , where the weary finally rest ! 
 This is what Darnay said to Lucie as he held her to his chest . 
 I can bear it , my dear Charles . God above supports me . Don't worry about me . Give me a parting blessing for our daughter . 
 I send it to her through you . I kiss her by kissing you . I say farewell to her by saying it to you . 
 My husband . No ! One moment ! He was pulling himself apart from her . We will not be separated long . I feel that this will break my heart and that I will die soon , but I will take care of her while I can . When I die , God will send friends to take care of her , as He did for me . 
 Her father had followed her . He would have fallen to his knees in front of both of them , but Darnay reached out his hand and took hold of him , crying : 
 No , no ! What have you done that should make you kneel before us ? We know now how much you struggled before . We know now what you went through when you suspected my family history and when you learned that it was true . We know now the feelings of hatred toward me that you fought against and conquered for the sake of your daughter . We thank you with all our hearts , and all our love and duty . Heaven be with you ! 
 Dr . Manette's only answer was to run his hands through his white hair , then wring them with a cry of anguish . 
 It could not be otherwise , said Darnay . This was inevitable . It was always useless to ignore my poor mother's trust that first brought my deadly presence near you . Good could never come from such evil . A happier end could never come from such an unhappy beginning . Take comfort and forgive me . Heaven bless you ! 
 Lucie let go of him as the guards pulled him away . She stood watching him , her hands clasped together in a position of prayer . She had a radiant look on her face and was even smiling comfortingly . As he went out through the prisoners' door , she turned and put her head lovingly on her father's breast , tried to speak to him , and fell at his feet . 
 Then , Sydney Carton came out of the hidden corner from which he had never moved and picked her up . Only her father and Mr . Lorry were with her . His arm trembled as he raised her and supported her head , yet there was a manner about him that wasn't all pity . There was something proud in him . 
 Shall I take her to a coach ? She's so light , I won't even feel her weight . 
 He carried her easily to the door and laid her tenderly down in a coach . Her father and Mr . Lorry got into it , and Carton took his seat beside the driver . 
 They arrived at the gate where he had stopped in the dark just a few hours before to wonder which cobblestones Lucie had walked on . He lifted her again and carried her up the staircase to their apartment . There , he laid her down on a couch , and her daughter and Miss Pross wept over her . 
 Don't revive her , he said softly to Miss Pross . She is better off unconscious . She has only fainted . 
 Oh , Carton , Carton , dear Carton ! cried little Lucie . She jumped up and threw her arms around him passionately , in a burst of grief . Now that you have come , I think you'll do something to help Mamma and save Papa ! Oh , look at her , dear Carton ! Can you , of all the people who love her , stand to see her like this ? 
 He leaned over the child and laid her cheek against his face . He pulled her off of him gently and looked at her unconscious mother . 
 Before I go , he said , pausing , may I kiss her ? 
 They remembered afterward that when he bent down and kissed her face , he murmured some words . Little Lucie , who was closest to him , told them afterward , and told her grandchildren when she was an old woman , that she heard him say , A life you love . 
 When he had gone into the next room , he turned suddenly toward Mr . Lorry and her father , who were following him . He said to the doctor : 
 You had great influence as recently as yesterday , Dr . Manette . At least try to use it again . These judges and all of these men in power are very friendly to you . They know very well what you have done , don't they ? 
 Nothing about Charles was hidden from me when he was in prison . I was assured that I would definitely save him , and I did . He answered with great difficulty and very slowly . 
 Try to use your influence again . There isn't much time between now and tomorrow afternoon , but try . 
 I intend to try . I won't rest for a moment . 
 Good . I have known energy like yours to do great things before now , though never he added smiling and sighing as great as this . But try ! Our life is worth so little when we misuse it . It is worth at least this effort . Our lives would be worth nothing if it weren't . 
 I will go to the prosecutor and the president right away , said Dr . Manette . And I will go to the others whom I shouldn't name . I will write too , andbut wait ! There is a celebration in the streets . I won't be able to reach anyone until it's dark . 
 That's true . Well ! It is a desperate hope at best . It's not much more desperate if it's delayed until dark . I'll want to know how you do . But remember ! I don't expect anything . When are you likely to meet with these powerful people , Dr . Manette ? 
 Immediately after dark , I hope . Within an hour or two from now . 
 It will be dark soon after four o'clock . If I go to Mr . Lorry's at nine , will I be able to hear how you have done , either from a friend or from yourself ? 
 Yes . 
 Good luck ! 
 Mr . Lorry followed Sydney to the outer door . He touched him on the shoulder as he was going away , causing him to turn around . 
 I have no hope , said Mr . Lorry , in a quiet , sorrowful whisper . 
 Neither have I . 
 If any one of these men , or even all of these men , wanted to spare himwhich is asking a lot , for what do they care about his life , or any man's life ? I doubt that they would dare to do it after the way the crowd reacted in the courtroom today . 
 So do I . I heard the sound of an axe falling in their screams . 
 Mr . Lorry leaned his arm on the doorpost and buried his face in it . 
 Don't worry , said Carton very gently . Don't grieve . I encouraged Dr . Manette in this idea because I felt that it might one day make Lucie feel better . Otherwise , she might think to herself , 'his life was thrown away or wasted , ' and that might upset her . 
 Yes , yes , yes , answered Mr . Lorry , wiping the tears from his eyes . You're right . But he will die . There is no real hope . 
 Yes . He will die . There is no real hope , repeated Carton . 
 And with that , Carton walked confidently downstairs . 
 Sydney Carton paused in the street , unsure where to go . We're meeting at Tellson's Bank at nine o'clock , he said , thinking it over . Would it be good to be seen in public in the meantime ? I think so . It's best that people know that a man that looks like me is here in Paris . It's a smart precaution to take , and it might be necessary to prepare for later . But wait ! Let me think it over ! 
 He had started walking toward his goal , but now he stopped . He turned around once or twice in the street , which was already growing dark . He thought through his plan to see what the possible results might be . His first thought was confirmed . It's best that these people know that a man that looks like me is here , he said , finally deciding . He turned and headed toward Saint Antoine . 
 Defarge had described himself that day at the court as the owner of a wine shop in the suburb of Saint Antoine . It wasn't hard for someone who knew the city well to find his house without asking any questions . Carton found out where it was and came out of those narrow streets again . He ate dinner at an inn and fell fast asleep after dinner . For the first time in many years , he did not drink any strong alcohol . Since the night before , he had drunk nothing but a little light , weak wine , and he had poured his brandy slowly out on Mr . Lorry's hearth like a man who would never drink again . 
 It was as late as seven o'clock in the evening when he awoke refreshed and went out into the streets again . As he walked toward Saint Antoine he stopped at a shop window where there was a mirror . He slightly rearranged the messy appearance of his loose cravat a scarf or piece of fabric worn around a man's neck and tied in front cravat , the collar of his coat , and his wild hair . Having finished , he went directly to Defarge's wine shop and went in . 
 There were no other customers in the shop besides Jacques Three , the man with the restless fingers and the rough voice . Jacques Three , whom Carton had seen on the jury , stood drinking at the little counter . He was talking to Monsieur and Madame Defarge . The Vengeance was also talking with them , like a regular visitor to the shop . 
 Carton walked in , took a seat , and asked for a small measure of wine in very poor French . Madame Defarge glanced at him carelessly . Then she looked closer and closer , and went over to him herself and asked what he had ordered . 
 He repeated his order . 
 Are you English ? Madame Defarge asked , raising her dark eyebrows at him questioningly . 
 After looking at her , as if he had difficulty understanding even a single French word , he answered in a strong English accent , Yes , Madame . I am English . 
 Madame Defarge went back to the counter to get the wine . Carton picked up a journal on Jacobins a political club formed during the French Revolution Jacobins and pretended to read it as if trying to understand it . He heard her say , I swear to you , he looks like Evremonde ! 
 Defarge brought him his wine and wished him a good evening . 
 How ? Carton asked in poor French . 
 Good evening . 
 Oh ! Good evening , citizen , said Carton , filling his glass . Ah ! and good wine . I toast my glass to the Republic . 
 Defarge went back to the counter . He said , He certainly looks a little like him . Madame answered firmly , I tell you , he looks a lot like him . Jacques Three said soothingly , You have been thinking about him so much that you are starting to see him everywhere , madame . The Vengeance added , laughing , Yes ! And you are so anxious to see him one last time tomorrow at his execution ! 
 Carton pretended to work strenuously at reading his paper , following the words with his finger . He looked completely absorbed . They were all leaning their arms on the counter and were close together , speaking quietly . They all looked at him for a few moments in silence without distracting him from his Jacobin journal . Then they resumed their conversation . 
 It's true what Madame Defarge says , said Jacques Three . Why stop now ? That makes a lot of sense . Why stop now ? 
 Well , well , reasoned Defarge . But we have to stop somewhere . After all , the question is , where do we stop ? 
 We stop after they have been exterminated , said Madame Defarge . 
 Wonderful ! said Jacques Three , hoarsely . The Vengeance also enthusiastically approved . 
 Extermination is a good policy , my wife said Defarge , rather troubled . In general I have nothing against it . But Dr . Manette has suffered a great deal . You saw him today . You saw his face when they read the paper he had written in prison . 
 I saw his face ! repeated Madame Defarge hatefully and angrily . Yes . I saw his face . I see that his face is not the face of a true friend to the Republic . Let him worry about his face ! 
 And you have seen how much his daughter has suffered , said Defarge to his wife disapprovingly . Her suffering must torture him ! 
 I have seen his daughter , repeated Madame Defarge . Yes , I have seen his daughter several times . I saw her today and I have seen her other days . I have seen her in court and I have seen her in the street by the prison . Let me just raise a finger Carton thought that she raised it , although he never looked up from his paper . She let it fall with a rattle on the edge of the counter in front of her , as if it were an axe falling . 
 Madame Defarge is superb ! said Jacques Three hoarsely . 
 She is an angel ! ' said The Vengeance . She embraced Madame Defarge . 
 As far as you are concerned , continued Madame Defarge unforgivingly to her husband , if it depended on youwhich , fortunately , it does notyou would rescue Darnay right now . 
 No ! Defarge argued . Not even if I could save him just by raising this glass ! But I would end it there . I say we should stop there . 
 See you then , Jacques , said Madame Defarge wrathfully . And see you too , Vengeance . I'll see you both . Listen ! I have the Evremonde family on my list for other crimes as tyrants and oppressors . They are doomed to be destroyed and exterminated . Ask my husband if it's true . 
 It's true , Defarge agreed , without being asked . 
 Defarge found the paper we heard read today in the first days of the Revolution , when the Bastille fell . He brought it home , and in the middle of the night , when this shop was empty and closed up , we read it . Right here by the light of this lamp . Ask him if it's true . 
 It's true , agreed Defarge . 
 That night , after we had read through the paper , the lamp had burned out and the daylight was shining in above those shutters and between those iron bars . I told him I had a secret to tell him . Ask him if it's true . 
 It's true , agreed Defarge . 
 I told him my secret . I struck my chest with these two hands as I strike it now , and I told him , ëDefarge , I was raised by fishermen on the seashore . The peasant family harmed so badly by the two Evremonde brothers , as described in the paper from the Bastille , is my family . Defarge , that sister of the wounded boy who died on the ground was my sister . That husband who was killed was my sister's husband . That unborn child she carried was their child . That brother was my brother . That father was my father . Those dead people are my dead . The responsibility to bring the guilty to justice belongs to me ! ' Ask him if it's true . 
 It's true , agreed Defarge once more . 
 Then tell the wind and fire where to stop , answered Madame Defarge . But don't tell me . 
 Jacques Three and The Vengeance seemed to enjoy hearing the reasons for her wrath , and both praised her highly . Carton could feel how angry she was without looking at her . Defarge was a weak minority in the group . He added a few words about the memory of the compassionate wife of the marquis , but his wife only repeated her last answer . Tell the wind and fire where to stop , but don't tell me ! 
 Customers came into the wine shop and the group split up . Carton paid for his wine and counted out his change as though French money confused him . He asked for directions to the National Palace as if he were a stranger to the city . Madame Defarge took him to the door . She put her arm on his as she pointed out the road . Carton had the thought that he could do a good deed by lifting her arm , stabbing her in her side , and killing her . 
 Instead , he went on his way , and he was soon standing in the shadow of the prison wall . At nine o'clock , he left and went to Mr . Lorry's room again , where he found him pacing anxiously back and forth in restless anxiety . He said he had been with Lucie until just recently , and that he had only left her for a few minutes to come and keep his appointment . Dr . Manette hadn't been seen since he left the bank just before four o'clock . Lucie had some faint hope that the doctor could intervene and save Charles , but that hope was small . He had been gone for more than five hours . Where could he be ? 
 Mr . Lorry waited until ten o'clock , and Dr . Manette still hadn't returned . He didn't want to leave Lucie alone any longer , so they decided he would go back to Lucie and return to the bank again at midnight . In the meantime , Carton would wait for the doctor alone by the fire . 
 Carton waited and waited . The clock struck twelve , and Dr . Manette had still not come back . Mr . Lorry returned and learned that no one had heard from the doctor . He had brought no news of him either . Where could he be ? 
 They were discussing this question , and were starting to believe his absence might mean he'd had some success , when they heard him coming up the stairs . As soon as he entered the room , it was obvious that there was no hope . 
 They never learned whether he had really been to see anyone or whether he had been out walking the streets the whole time . He stood there staring at them , and they didn't ask him any questions . The expression on his face told them everything . 
 I can't find it , he said . And I need it . Where is it ? 
 His head and throat were bare . He looked around the room distractedly as he spoke , took his coat off , and let it drop on the floor . 
 Where is my bench ? I've been looking everywhere for my bench , and I can't find it . What have they done with the shoes I was working on ? I'm running out of time . I must finish those shoes . 
 Carton and Mr . Lorry looked at each other , devastated . 
 Come , come ! he said , whimpering miserably . Let me get to work . Give me my work . 
 When he didn't get an answer he tore at his hair and pounded his feet on the floor like an angry child . 
 Don't torture a poor , sad wretch , he begged them , screaming . Give me my work ! What will happen to us if I don't finish those shoes tonight ? 
 All was lost ! 
 It was clear that there was no point in reasoning with him or trying to revive him . Carton and Mr . Lorry both put a hand on his shoulder as if they had agreed to do so . They told him soothingly to sit down in front of the fire , and they promised him that he would have his work soon . He sank into the chair , staring into the embers , and started to cry . It was as if everything that had happened since he had been making shoes in the attic in Saint Antoine had been a dream . Mr . Lorry saw the doctor shrink into the exact same man that Defarge had kept at his shop . 
 Carton and Mr . Lorry were both terrified to see him in such horrible shape , but it wasn't the time to give in to such emotions . They both thought of Lucie . She had now lost the only person whom she could rely on and who could give her hope . Again , as if they had agreed to do so , they looked at each other and knew what they needed to do . Carton spoke first : 
 We have lost our last chance . It wasn't much . Yes . We had better take Dr . Manette to see Lucie . But before you go , will you listen to me for a moment ? Don't ask me why I demand the conditions I am about to make , or why I demand the promise I am going to ask . I have a good reason . 
 I'm sure that you do , answered Mr . Lorry . Go on . 
 Dr . Manette was rocking back and forth and moaning the whole time as he sat in a chair between them . They spoke quietly , as if they were sitting by a patient's sickbed at night . 
 Carton bent over to pick up the coat . It lay on the floor and was almost wrapped around his feet . As he did so , a small case in which the doctor carried his list of the day's duties fell on the floor . Carton picked it up , and there was a folded paper in it . We should look at this ! he said . Mr . Lorry nodded in agreement . He opened it and exclaimed , Thank God ! 
 What is it ? Mr . Lorry asked anxiously . 
 Give me a moment . Let me talk about it in context . He put his hand in his coat pocket and took out another piece of paper . This is a certificate that allows me to leave Paris . Look at it . You see ? It says , ëSydney Carton , an Englishman . '
 Mr . Lorry held it open in his hand and looked at Carton's face . 
 Hold onto it for me until tomorrow . You remember that I am going to go see Darnay tomorrow . I'd better not bring it with me into the prison . 
 Why not ? 
 I don't know . I'd prefer not to . Now , take this paper that Dr . Manette has been carrying with him . It is a similar certificate , which allows Lucie and her daughter to cross the barrier out of Paris at any time . You see ? 
 Yes ! 
 Perhaps he got it as his last safety measure yesterday . When is it dated ? It doesn't matter . Don't stay to look . Tuck it away carefully with my certificate and your own . Now , look ! I never doubted until the past hour or two that he had , or could get , a paper like this . It is valid until it is revoked , but it may be revoked soon , and I have reason to think that it will be . 
 They are not in danger ? 
 They are in great danger . They are in danger of being accused by Madame Defarge . I heard it from her own lips . I have overheard things she said tonight that make it clear they are in great danger . I didn't waste time . I went to see Barsad right away , and he confirmed it for me . He knows that a wood sawyer who lives by the prison wall is under the influence of Monsieur and Madame Defarge . They have told him to say that he has seen 'her'he never mentioned Lucie's namemaking signs and signals to the prisoners . It's easy to see that they will make the usual claimthat she is involved in a prison plot . They will accuse Lucie , and possibly her daughter and her father , since they have all been seen there . Don't look so horrified . You will save all of them . 
 I hope to Heaven that I will , Carton . But how ? 
 I will tell you how . It will depend on you , and there is no better man than you to depend on . This new accusation will certainly not take place until after tomorrow , probably not until two or three days afterward . It's more likely that it will be a week afterward . You know it is a capital crime to mourn for or sympathize with someone who is executed at the guillotine , so she and her father will without a doubt be guilty of this crime . Madame Defarge , who will stop at nothing , will add that accusation to her case and make sure that they are convicted . You follow me ? 
 I'm listening so closely , and with so much confidence that what you say is true , that for the moment I have even forgotten about this problem , Mr . Lorry said , touching the back of the doctor's chair . 
 You have money . You can pay for the quickest possible means of travel to the seacoast . You made plans to return to England some days ago . Have your horses made ready early tomorrow so that they can leave at two o'clock in the afternoon . 
 I will do it ! 
 Carton was so passionate and inspiring that it made Mr . Lorry as eager as a young man . 
 You are a good man . Did I say that there is no better man we could depend on ? Tell Lucie tonight about the danger you know regarding her child and father . Focus on that , because she would happily die along with her husband . He hesitated for a moment and then continued on as before . Tell her that , for the sake of her child and father , she needs to leave Paris with her daughter , her father , and you at that time . Tell her it was the last arrangement her husband made . Tell her that more depends on it than she would dare believe or hope . You think that her father , even as disturbed as he is , will go with her , don't you ? 
 I'm sure of it . 
 I thought so . Make these arrangements quietly and quickly in the courtyard outside . You should even go so far as to already be sitting in the carriage . The moment I come to you , take me into the carriage and drive away . 
 I should wait for you under any circumstances , yes ? 
 You have my travel certificate in your hand with the others , you know , and will save my place . Wait for nothing else except to have my place in the carriage filled , then leave for England ! 
 Why , then , said Mr . Lorry , grasping his eager , steady hand , it doesn't all depend on me , an old man . I will have a strong , young man by my side helping me . 
 With Heaven's help you will ! Promise me that nothing will make you change the plan that we have agreed on . 
 Nothing , Carton . 
 Remember this conversation tomorrow . If you change the plan , or delay for any reason , no one's life can possibly be saved , and many lives will be sacrificed . 
 I will remember it . I hope to do my part faithfully . 
 And I hope to do mine . Now , goodbye ! 
 Though he said it with a sincere smile and even kissed Mr . Lorry's hand , he didn't leave him yet . He helped him get Dr . Manette , who was rocking back and forth in front of the dying embers in the fireplace , to his feet . They helped him put a cloak and a hat on , and they lured him outside by telling him that they were looking for the hidden bench and shoes that he was crying out for . Carton walked on the other side of the doctor and protected him as they walked through the courtyard of the Manette's house . Lucie was there . She was so sad now , and she had been so happy back when Carton had told her of his feelings for her . Carton entered the courtyard and remained there for a few minutes alone , looking up at the light coming from her window . Before he went away , he said a blessing for her and said goodbye . 
 In the dark prison of the Conciergerie , the condemned prisoners waited to be executed . The number of condemned prisoners was the same as the number of weeks in a year . Fifty-two people were to be carted through the city streets to their deaths , and new prisoners were assigned to their cells before they had even left them . Before the condemned were killed , the next round of condemned prisoners had already been named . 
 Fifty-two names were read out : from the seventy-year-old farmer-general whose wealth couldn't save him , to the twenty-year-old seamstress , whose poverty and insignificance couldn't save her . Sickness caused by immoral behavior and self-neglect will infect people of any social class . The frightening moral sickness that came from unspeakable suffering , oppression , and heartless apathy also struck down its victims regardless of their position in life . 
 Charles Darnay was alone in a cell . He had no delusions about being saved since he came to the cell from the tribunal . He knew that every word of the story he had heard condemned him to death . He had fully understood that no person's influence could possibly save him . It was as if all the millions of people of France had pronounced his sentence , so one person alone could do nothing to help him . 
 Nevertheless , it wasn't easy to prepare his mind for his coming death . He kept picturing his beloved wife's face . He had many reasons to live , and it was hard to let go . When he let go of one reason to live , another made him want to hold on tighter . When he came to terms with that and let go a little , the other would tighten . His thinking was rushed , too , and his heart beat rapidly , working against his acceptance of death . If he were able to come to terms with death for a moment , the thought of his wife and child , who would have to go on living without him , would make him feel that he was being selfish . 
 But this only happened at first . Before long he had the thought that there was no shame in dying this way . The thought that many innocent people died the same way and faced it bravely every day made him feel better . He realized that he had to face death with quiet strength if he wanted his family to have any peace of mind in the future . Little by little he calmed down to a state where he could think happier thoughts and take some comfort . 
 This was his state of mind before it had grown dark on the night Darnay was condemned . He was allowed to buy a light and some things to write with , and he sat down to write until the time when the prison lamps had to be put out . 
 He wrote a long letter to Lucie and told her that he hadn't known anything about her father's imprisonment until she had told him herself . He told her he didn't know anything about his father's and uncle's roles in that imprisonment until Dr . Manette's paper had been read . He had already explained to her that he had hidden his real name from her because it was the one condition that her father had made when he agreed to let them be married . It made sense now , and the doctor had held him to this promise on the morning of their marriage . He begged her , for her father's sake , never to try to find out if her father had forgotten about the existence of the paper , or if he had remembered it after Darnay told the story about the Tower of London that Sunday long ago under the plane tree in the garden . If he had remembered any of it , he surely would have assumed it had been destroyed when the Bastille fell , since he had not heard it mentioned with the other belongings that people had found there and told the world about . He begged herthough he added that he knew asking wasn't necessaryto comfort her father by letting him know in every way she could think of that he hadn't done anything he should blame himself for . He had forgotten all about it for both of their sakes . Next , as they would one day meet in Heaven , he begged her to preserve the memory of his love for her , to overcome her sorrow , and to devote herself to their child and to comforting her father . 
 He wrote a similar letter to Dr . Manette , telling the doctor specifically that he left Lucie and their daughter in his care . He was very adamant about this and hoped this responsibility would lift him out of any hopelessness or dangerous reflection that Darnay thought he might fall into . 
 He wrote to Mr . Lorry and told him to take care of all of them . He also explained all his personal and business affairs . After that was done , he thanked him for his friendship and affection . Then he was done . He never thought about Mr . Carton . He was so focused on the others that he didn't even think of him once . 
 He had time to finish these letters before the lamps were all put out . When he lied down on his straw bed , he thought that his life was over . 
 But his life came back to him while he slept , and showed itself in happy memories . He saw himself free and happy back in the old house in Soho (though it had nothing in it that looked like the interior of the real house) . He was completely free and lighthearted , with Lucie again . She told him it was all a dream and he had never left London . He slept without dreaming for a while , and then he dreamt he had been killed and had come back to her , dead and at peace , and yet he had not changed at all . He slept without dreaming again for a while , and he woke up in the morning . He didn't know where he was or what had happened , until it flashed in his mind , This is the day I am going to die . 
 This is how he spent the hours leading up to the day when fifty-two people were to have their heads cut off . He was calm now and hoped that he could face his death with quiet bravery . But a new idea came to him that made this very difficult to do . 
 He had never seen the guillotine before . He hadn't seen how high it was off the ground , how many steps it had , or where he would stand . He didn't know how the executioner would treat him or whether the executioner's hands would be stained with blood . He didn't know which way his face would be turned or whether he would be the first person or the last person to die that day . These and many similar questions forced their way into his mind over and over again . They weren't connected with any feelings of fear fear . He wasn't aware of being afraid at all . Instead , they came from wanting to know what to do when the time came . His worry was greatly out of proportion with the few quick moments that he would actually be there . It was like another spirit inside of him other than his own was wondering about this . 
 The hours passed as he paced back and forth , and the clocks struck numbers he would never hear again : nine gone forever , ten gone forever , eleven gone forever , and twelve was on its way . After struggling hard with this strange , disturbing thought , he got the better of it . He paced up and down , softly repeating his loved ones' names to himself . The worst of his suffering was over . He could walk up and down , free from distracting thoughts , praying for himself and for them . 
 Twelve o'clock came and was gone forever . 
 He had been told that three o'clock was the hour for the executions . He knew he would be brought out sometime before that , since the tumbrils of condemned prisoners moved through the streets very slowly . Therefore , he decided to think of two o'clock as the important hour , so he could strengthen himself in the meantime and after that time focus on strengthening others . 
 Walking back and forth with his arms folded on his chest , he was a very different man from the prisoner who had walked back and forth at La Force Prison . He heard the clock strike one without surprise . The hour had gone past like most other hours . He was thankful to Heaven that he had control of himself again . He thought , There is just one more hour to go , and he turned and continued walking back and forth again . 
 He heard footsteps in the stone passageway outside the door and stopped . 
 A key turned in the lock in the door . Before the door opened , or as it was being opened , a man said quietly in English , He has never seen me here . I have kept out of his way . Go in alone . I'll wait nearby . Don't waste any time ! 
 The door was quickly opened and closed , and Sydney Carton was standing in front of him , face-to-face . He was quiet and looking at him intently , smiling with his finger to his lips . 
 There was something so cheerful and unusual about his expression that at first Darnay thought he was imagining things . But then Carton spoke , and it was Carton's real voice . He took Darnay's hand , and Darnay could feel his real grasp . 
 Of all the people on earth , am I the last person you expected to see ? he said . 
 I couldn't believe it was you . I can hardly believe it now . Darnay was suddenly worried . You aren't a prisoner , are you ? 
 No . I happen to have some power over one of the guards here . That's why I am standing here in front of you . Your wife sent me , my dear Darnay . 
 Darnay shook his hand . 
 I bring a request from her . 
 What is it ? 
 It's a serious , urgent request . She sends it to you in the most pathetic tones of her voice that you love so much and remember so well . 
 Darnay turned his face to the side . 
 There's no time to ask me why I bring it or what it means . I don't have time to tell you . You must agree to it . Take off your boots and put on mine . 
 Carton was as quick as lightning . There was a chair against the wall of the cell behind Darnay , and he had already moved forward and pushed Darnay into it . He stood over him , barefoot . 
 Put on my boots . Grab them and put them on . Quickly ! 
 Carton , there is no way to escape this place . It will never work . You will only be killed along with me . This is crazy . 
 It would be crazy if I asked you to escape . But do I ? If I ask you to go out that door and try to escape , tell me it's crazy and stay here . Exchange cravats and coats with me . While you do it , let me take this ribbon out of your hair . Shake out your hair so it looks like mine ! 
 Very quickly and with a physical strength and a mental focus that seemed supernatural , Carton made him do all these things . Darnay was like a young child in his hands . 
 Carton ! Dear Carton ! It's crazy . It can't be done . It will never work . People have tried to escape and have always failed . I beg you ! Don't get yourself killed , too . 
 Do I ask you , Darnay , to go out the door ? When I ask that , you can refuse . There's a pen , ink , and paper on this table . Is your hand steady enough for you to write ? 
 It was when you came in . 
 Steady it again and write down what I say . Quickly , my friend ! 
 Darnay grabbed his head with his hand in confusion and sat down at the table . Carton had his right hand on his breast pocket . He stood close beside him . 
 Write exactly what I say . 
 To whom should I address it ? 
 To no one . Carton still had his hand in his breast pocket . 
 Should I date it ? 
 No . 
 Darnay looked up when he asked each question . When he did , Carton looked down from where he was standing . He still had his hand in his breast pocket . 
 ëIf you remember what we said to each other long ago , you will understand this when you read it , ' Carton dictated . ëYou do remember it , I know . It is not in your nature to forget it . '
 He was pulling his hand out of his breast pocket . Darnay happened to look up quickly as he wrote . Carton's hand stopped and grabbed hold of something . 
 Have you written ëforget it' yet ? asked Carton . 
 I have . Is that a weapon in your hand ? 
 No . I am unarmed . 
 What's in your hand ? 
 You will know very soon . Keep writing . There are only a few words more . He dictated again . ëI am thankful that the time has come when I can prove them to be true . The fact that I am doing it shouldn't make you regret it or grieve . ' As he said these words , he looked at Darnay . His hand slowly and gently moved down close to Darnay's face . 
 Darnay dropped the pen onto the table and looked around him , dazed . 
 What is that vapor ? he asked . 
 Vapor ? 
 Did I inhale something ? 
 I'm not aware of anything . There can't be anything here . Pick up the pen and finish . Hurry , hurry ! 
 It was as if Darnay's memory were failing or his senses were dulled . He tried hard to stay focused . As he looked at Carton with blurred vision and shortened breath , Carton looked back at him steadily . His hand was in his breast pocket again . 
 Hurry , hurry ! 
 Darnay bent over the paper again . 
 ëIf it had been otherwise' Carton's hand was carefully moving toward Darnay's face again ëI never would have used the great opportunity . ' Carton's hand was at Darnay's face again . ëIf it had been otherwise , I would have had much more to lose . If it had been otherwise' Carton looked at the pen and saw that his writing was trailing off into meaningless scribble . 
 Carton didn't move his hand back to his breast pocket anymore . Darnay jumped up with an accusing look , but Carton was holding his hand firmly up to his nostrils . Carton's left arm caught him around the waist , and for a few seconds Darnay tried to fight with Carton , who had come to lay down his life for him . But within a minute or so , Darnay was stretched out on the ground , unconscious . 
 Quickly , but with sure hands and a sure heart , Carton dressed himself in the clothes Darnay had laid aside . He combed back his hair and tied it with the ribbon Darnay had been wearing . Then he called quietly , Enter there ! Come in ! Barsad came in . 
 You see ? said Carton , looking up . He kneeled on one knee beside the unconscious Darnay . He put the paper into his breast pocket . Are you in great danger of getting in trouble ? 
 Mr . Carton , answered Barsad , snapping his fingers timidly , this business doesn't put me in danger if you stay true to your side of the deal . 
 Don't be afraid of me . I will be true until my death . 
 You have to be , Mr . Carton , if fifty-two people are to die . If you go through with it dressed like that , I shall have nothing to fear . 
 Have no fear ! I will soon be dead and won't be able to hurt you . Everyone else , God willing , will soon be far away . Now , get help and take me to the coach . 
 You ? asked Barsad , nervously . 
 Him , man , whom I have changed places with . Do you go out at the same gate you brought me in through ? 
 Of course . 
 Tell them I was weak and faint when you brought me in and I am fainter now that you are taking me out . Tell them my final conversation with Darnay was too much for me . Such a thing has happened here oftentoo often . Your life is in your own hands . Quick ! Call for help ! 
 You swear not to betray me ? said Barsad , trembling as he paused for a moment . 
 Man , man ! answered Carton , stamping his foot . Haven't I already sworn a solemn vow to go through with this ? Why are you wasting precious time now ? Take him to the courtyard you know of and put him in the carriage yourself . Show him to Mr . Lorry and tell Mr . Lorry he only needs some fresh air to revive him . Tell him to remember what I said and the promise he made last night . Then tell him to drive away ! 
 Barsad left and Carton sat down at the table . He rested his forehead on his hands . Barsad returned immediately with two men . 
 What happened ? asked one of them , looking at the man who had fallen down . He's troubled to find out that his friend is being sent to the guillotine ? 
 A good patriot could hardly have been more upset if this nobleman had been released . 
 They picked up the unconscious man and put him on the stretcher they had brought to the door . They bent down to carry it away . 
 We're running out of time , Evremonde , Barsad said to Carton in a warning voice . 
 I know , answered Carton . Please take care of my friend and leave me alone . 
 Come on , boys , said Barsad . Lift him up and come this way . 
 The door closed , and Carton was left alone . He strained to hear any sounds that might show that they were suspicious . There were none . He heard keys turning , doors slamming shut , and footsteps walking along hallways in the distance . He didn't hear anything unusual , like people yelling or rushing around . He breathed easier for a little while . He sat down at the table and listened again until the clock struck two . 
 Then he heard sounds , but he wasn't afraid of them because he knew what they meant . Several doors opened one after another , and finally his own door opened . A jailer with a list in his hand looked inside . All he said was , Follow me , Evremonde ! Carton followed him into a large , dark room that was far away . It was a dark winter day . The shadows inside and outside made it difficult to see the other people who were brought there to have their arms tied . Some were standing up and some were seated . A few of them were crying and some were moving around nervously . But most of them were silent and still , staring at the ground . 
 He stood by the wall in a dark corner while some of the fifty-two others were brought in after him . One man stopped to embrace him as he passed by as if he knew him . Carton felt terrified he would be found out , but the man continued on . A few moments later a young woman got up from where he had seen her sitting and came over to speak to him . She had a small , girlish figure , a beautiful pale face , and large , widely opened patient eyes . 
 Citizen Evremonde , she said , touching him with her cold hand . I am a poor seamstress . I was with you in La Force Prison . 
 He murmured , That's right . I forgetwhat were you accused of ? 
 Plots . Though Heaven knows that I am innocent . Is it likely ? Who would think of plotting with a poor , little weak creature like me ? 
 She smiled sadly when she said it , and he was so touched that he started to tear up . 
 I am not afraid to die , Citizen Evremonde . But I haven't done anything wrong . I am not unwilling to die if the Republic , which will do so much good for poor people like me , will benefit from my death . But I don't know how that can be , Citizen Evremonde . I'm such a poor , weak , little creature ! 
 He was moved by this poor girl , and she was the last thing on earth that would move him . 
 I heard you were released , Citizen Evremonde . I hoped it was true . 
 It was . But I was arrested again and condemned to die . 
 If I can ride in the same cart as you , Citizen Evremonde , will you let me hold your hand ? I'm not afraid , but I am little and weak and it will give me more courage . 
 As the girl looked up into his face , he saw that she suddenly doubted whether he was actually who he said . She looked astonished , and he kissed her young fingers , which were worn from years of poverty . 
 Are you dying for him ? she whispered . 
 And for his wife and child . Hush ! Yes . I am dying for him . 
 Oh , will you let me hold your hand , brave stranger ? 
 Hush ! Yes , my dear . To the very end . 
 ***
 The same shadows that were falling on the prison were falling on the barrier at that same time in the early afternoon . There was a crowd around it , and a coach on its way out of Paris drove up to it to be questioned . 
 Who goes there ? said the guard . Whom do you have inside ? Show us your papers ! 
 The people inside the coach handed the guard the papers and he read them . 
 Alexandre Manette . Doctor . French . Which one is he ? 
 They pointed out the confused old man . He was mumbling incoherently . 
 Apparently the citizen doctor is not in his right mind ? The Revolution fever was too much for him ? 
 It was far too much for him . 
 Ha ! Many people suffer from it , said the guard . He read from the certificate : Lucie . His daughter . French . Which one is she ? he asked . 
 They pointed her out . 
 It must be . Lucie . She's Evremonde's wife , isn't she ? 
 She is , they answered . 
 Ha ! Evremonde has a date elsewhere . Lucie , her child , English , he read . This is she ? 
 This is she . 
 Kiss me , daughter of Evremonde , the guard said to her . Now you have kissed a good Republican . That's something new to your family . Remember it ! Sydney Carton . Lawyer . English , the guard read . Which one is he ? 
 He was lying in a corner of the carriage . They pointed him out too . 
 Apparently the English lawyer has fainted ? 
 We hope he will recover from the fresh air . He isn't well and is upset to be separated from a friend who has angered the Republic . 
 Is that all ? That's no big deal ! Many have angered the Republic and must look out of the little windows of the prisons . Jarvis Lorry . Banker . English , read the guard . Which one is he ? 
 I am he , of course , since I am the only other person here . 
 It was Jarvis Lorry who had answered all the previous questions . It was Jarvis Lorry who got out and stood with his hand on the coach door , answering the group of officials . The guards slowly walked around the carriage and climbed up on top to look at what little luggage there was on the roof . The country people were hanging around , pressing nearer to the coach doors and staring into it greedily . A small child in its mother's arms was reaching out so that it could touch the wife of an aristocrat who had been killed by the guillotine . 
 Here are your papers , Jarvis Lorry . They have been signed and approved . 
 We can leave , citizen ? 
 You can leave . Move forward , postilions a person riding one of the horses in a team drawing a carriage postilions ! Have a good journey ! 
 Thank you , citizens ! . . . And we have passed the first threat . 
 Again it was Jarvis Lorry who said these words . He clasped his hands together and looked up . People in the carriage were terrified and crying , and the unconscious traveler was breathing heavily . 
 Aren't we going too slowly ? Can't we make them go faster ? asked Lucie , clinging to her father . 
 It would look like we were running away if we did . We can't make them go too fast . It would look suspicious . 
 Look back and see if they are chasing us ! 
 The road is empty , my dear . So far they are not chasing us . 
 They passed houses in groups of twos and threes , lonely farms , ruins of buildings , dye works , tanneries , and such . They passed open fields and rows of leafless trees . The road was made of hard , uneven pavement , and there was soft , deep mud on either side . Sometimes they would drive into the mud to avoid the stones that clattered and shook the carriage . Sometimes they got stuck in trenches and marshes . This would make them so wildly impatient that they would want to get out and run or hideanything but stop . 
 They left the open fields and were again surrounded by ruined buildings , farms , dye works , tanneries , and such . They saw more cottages in groups of twos and threes and more rows of leafless trees . Have these men tricked us ? they wondered . Are they taking us back to Paris by another road ? Isn't this the same place that we have passed twice before ? Thank Heaven , no . There's a village . Look back and see if they are following us ! Hush . There's a posting house . 
 Slowly the four horses were unharnessed . The coach stood casually in the little street without its horses , looking like it would never move again . Slowly the new horses came into view one by one , and slowly the new postilions followed them , sucking and weaving the lashes of their whips . Slowly the old postilions counted their money , add the numbers incorrectly , and become dissatisfied with their pay . All this time , the anxious hearts of the travelers were beating faster than the fastest horses that were ever born could gallop . 
 After a while the new postilions got into their saddles and the old ones were left behind . They went through the village , up and down a hill and onto the low , watery grounds . Suddenly , the postilions stopped speaking and started gesturing to each other wildly . The horses were pulled quickly to a stop . Were they being followed ? 
 Ho ! You inside the carriage . Speak ! 
 What is it ? asked Mr . Lorry , looking out the window . 
 How many did they say ? 
 I don't understand you . 
 At the last post . How many did they say were sent to the guillotine today ? 
 Fifty-two . 
 That's what I said ! A good number . My fellow citizen here said it was forty-two . There are ten more people than that who deserve to have their heads cut off today . The guillotine works well . I love it . Then he yelled at the horses , Forward ! Whoop ! 
 The night turned dark , and the unconscious traveler started to move more . He was beginning to wake up and to speak understandably again . He thought he was still together with Mr . Carton . He called Carton by his name and asked him what he had in his hand . Oh , take pity on them , Heaven , and help them ! Look out and see if they are being chased . 
 The wind is chasing them . The clouds are flying after them . The moon is falling and the night is chasing them . But so far , nothing else is chasing them . 
 While the fifty-two prisoners waited to be executed , Madame Defarge held a darkly ominous meeting with The Vengeance and Jacques Three of the Revolutionary jury . She didn't meet with them at the wine shop but in the shed of the wood sawyer , who used to be a repairer of roads . The wood sawyer himself did not take part in the meeting . He waited a little distance away , like an outsider who wasn't supposed to speak until he was needed or asked his opinion . 
 But Monsieur Defarge is a good Republican without a doubt , isn't he ? asked Jacques Three . 
 There isn't a better Republican in France , the talkative Vengeance said in her shrill voice . 
 Quiet , Vengeance , said Madame Defarge . She frowned and put her hand on The Vengeance's lips . Listen to me . My husband is a good Republican and a brave man . He deserves to be treated well by the Republic , and the government is confident in him . But my husband has his weaknesses . He is so weak that he will side with Dr . Manette . 
 It's a great pity , said Jacques Three hoarsely , shaking his head in doubt . His fingers were at his hungry mouth . He is not acting like a good citizen . It's unfortunate . 
 Look , said Madame Defarge . I don't care about this doctor at all . He can live or die as far as I care . It doesn't matter to me . But the Evremonde family has to die out , and the wife and child must die like their husband and father . 
 She has a good head for it , answered Jacques Three hoarsely . I have seen someone with blue eyes and blond hair beheaded . The head looked beautiful when the executioner held it up . He was such a monster that he spoke the way a gourmet talks about food . 
 Madame Defarge looked down and thought a little . 
 The child also has blond hair and blue eyes , said Jacques Three , thoughtfully enjoying his words . We rarely have a child sent to the guillotine . It's a pretty sight ! 
 In a word , said Madame Defarge , getting back onto the subject , I can't trust my husband about this . Since last night I've felt that I can't trust him with the details of my plans . I also feel that if I delay he could warn them , and then they might escape . 
 That must never happen , said Jacques Three hoarsely . No one must escape . We don't have enough people dying as it is . We should have a hundred and twenty people sent to the guillotine every day . 
 In a word , Madame Defarge continued , my husband doesn't have my reason for wanting to exterminate the Evremonde family , and I don't have his reason for having any affection for Dr . Manette . Therefore , I must act for myself . Come here , little citizen . 
 The wood sawyer , who was deathly afraid of Madame Defarge , came forward clutching his red cap . 
 About those signals that she made to the prisoners , little citizen , said Madame Defarge sternly . Are you ready to swear to them today ? 
 Yes , yes . Why not ? cried the wood sawyer . Every day , in any weather , from two to four o'clock , she was always signaling . Sometimes she came with her daughter ; sometimes she did not . I know what I know . I saw it with my own eyes . 
 He made all sorts of gestures as he spoke , as if he were imitating a few of the different signals that he had never actually seen Lucie make . 
 Clearly they were forming plots , said Jacques Three . It couldn't be more clear ! 
 Can we be sure the jury will convict her ? asked Madame Defarge . She looked at him with a gloomy smile . 
 You can count on the patriotic jury , citizeness . I speak for my fellow jurymen . 
 Now , let me see , said Madame Defarge , thinking it over again . Let me think it over just once more . Can I let this doctor live for my husband's sake ? I don't care either way . Can I spare him ? 
 He would be one more head , said Jacques Three quietly . We really don't have enough heads as it is . It would be a pity to let him live , I think . 
 He was signaling to the prisoners with Lucie when I saw her , argued Madame Defarge . I can't accuse one without accusing the other , and I can't keep quiet and put the whole case in this little citizen's hands , she said , pointing to the wood sawyer . I'm not a bad witness . 
 The Vengeance and Jacques Three both tried to outdo each other in saying that she was the most admirable and marvelous witness . The little wood sawyer didn't want to be outdone and called her a celestial witness . 
 He must take his chances , said Madame Defarge . No , I cannot spare him . You are busy at three o'clock . You are going to see the people who are to be executed today . You ? 
 She asked this to the wood sawyer . He hurriedly said yes and took this opportunity to say that he was a passionate Republican and that he would be the saddest of Republicans if anything stopped him from enjoying the pleasure of smoking his afternoon pipe while watching people killed at the guillotine . He was so passionate about it that he might have been suspected of fearing for his own personal safety at all times , and perhaps Madame Defarge did suspect him as she looked at him angrily with her dark eyes . 
 I will be doing the same thing there , said madame . After it's overlet's say at eight o'clock tonightcome to see me in Saint Antoine and we will go accuse these people at my Section . 
 The wood sawyer said he would be proud and flattered to go with Madame Defarge . Madame Defarge looked at him , and he became embarrassed . He avoided her look as if he were a small dog and hid his confusion by returning to sawing wood . 
 Madame Defarge beckoned to Jacques Three and The Vengeance to come closer to the door , and then she elaborated on her thoughts : 
 She will be at home now , waiting for him to be executed , mourning and grieving . She will want to accuse the Republic of injustice , and she will be sympathetic with the enemies of the Republic . I will go see her . 
 You are an admirable woman ! I adore you ! yelled Jacques Three enthusiastically . Ah , my cherished ! cried The Vengeance , embracing her . 
 Take my knitting , said Madame Defarge , giving it to The Vengeance . Have it waiting for me at my usual seat near the guillotine . Save my usual chair for me . Go right now , for there will probably me a bigger crowd than usual there today . 
 I will follow my chief's orders , said The Vengeance eagerly . She kissed Madame Defarge on the cheek . You won't be late ? 
 I'll be there before they begin . 
 And before the tumbrils arrive with the prisoners . Make sure that you are there before the tumbrils arrive ! The Vengeance called after her , but Madame Defarge had already stepped out into the street . 
 Madame Defarge slightly waved her hand to show that she had heard her and could be counted on to arrive on time . Then she walked through the mud and around the corner of the prison wall . The Vengeance and Jacques Three watched her as she walked away , admiring her for her beauty and her high morals . 
 There were many women who had been badly disfigured by the violent atmosphere of the time , but there was no one among them more terrifying than Madame Defarge , who was now walking through the streets . She had a strong and fearless character and was smart and always prepared . She was determined and had the kind of beauty that not only seems to impart strength and ferocity but also makes others recognize those qualities in her instinctually . The troubled times would have raised her up under any circumstances , but her childhood had also given her a sense of injustice and a hatred of the upper class . These conditions had turned her into a tigress , and she was completely pitiless . If she had ever had any pity in her , it was gone . 
 She didn't care that an innocent man was about to die for the sins of his ancestors . She saw them , not him . She didn't care that his wife was about to become a widow and his daughter an orphan . That wasn't enough punishment , because they were her natural enemies and prey , and so they had no right to live . It was useless to appeal to her , since she had no pity , even for herself . If she had been struck down in the streets in one of the many battles she had been involved in , she wouldn't have pitied herself . If she were sent to the guillotine to die tomorrow , she wouldn't feel anything but a strong desire to see the person who sent her there killed instead . 
 That was the heart Madame Defarge had under her rough robe . She wore her robe carelessly . It was an attractive robe in a strange way . Her dark hair looked thick under her rough red cap . A loaded pistol hid in her shirt , and a sharp dagger was hidden at her waist . Dressed like this , she walked confidently , like a woman who had often walked barefoot and barelegged along brown , sandy beaches as a young girl . Madame Defarge made her way through the streets . 
 At that very moment the traveling coach was waiting for the rest of its passengers . When the journey had been planned out the night before , Mr . Lorry had worried about what to do with Miss Pross . It wasn't only that they didn't want to overload the coach , but it was also very important that they kept the time required for the guards to examine all the passengers as short as possible , since their escape might depend on saving a few seconds here or there . After thinking it over anxiously , he finally suggested that Miss Pross and Jerry , who were free to leave the city at any time , should leave at three o'clock in the fastest possible vehicle . They were unburdened by luggage and would overtake the coach soon . Then they would pass it and go ahead of it on the road . This would speed up their progress during the night when they were most worried about being delayed . 
 Miss Pross was very pleased with this plan , as it offered a way to help them during their emergency . She and Jerry had seen the coach leave . They knew that her brother , Solomon , had helped Darnay into the coach disguised as Carton . They had spent about ten minutes in torturous suspense and were now finishing their arrangements to follow the coach as Madame Defarge made her way through the streets . Madame Defarge got closer and closer to the otherwise deserted house where they were meeting . 
 What do you think , Mr . Cruncher ? said Miss Pross . She was so nervous that she could hardly speak , or stand , or move , or live . What do you think about leaving from another courtyard ? Another carriage has already left from here today . It might look suspicious . 
 I think you're right , miss , answered Mr . Cruncher . Either way , I'll do what you want , right or wrong . 
 I am so troubled with fear and hope for our friends that I am unable to form a plan , said Miss Pross , crying wildly . Are you able to form any plan , Mr . Cruncher ? 
 I hope I will be able to in the future , answered Mr . Cruncher . Right now , I'm not able to think of anything . Would you do me a favor , miss , and listen to two promises and vows that I want to have on record here in this crisis ? 
 Oh , for gracious sake ! cried Miss Pross , still crying wildly . Say them quickly and get them out of the way , like a good man . 
 First , said Mr . Cruncher , trembling and looking pale and serious . If our poor friends get away , I won't do it anymore ! Never again ! 
 I'm quite sure that you will never do it again , Mr . Cruncher , whatever it is . Please don't think you need to tell me what you're talking about . 
 No , miss , answered Jerry . I won't tell you what it is . Second , if our poor friends get away , I won't ever interfere with Mrs . Cruncher's praying . Never again ! 
 Whatever situation you have at home , said Miss Pross , trying to dry her eyes and compose herself , I know it's best that Mrs . Cruncher is able to do what she wants . Oh , my poor friends ! 
 Remember what I'm telling you and tell Mrs . Cruncher yourself , continued Mr . Cruncher , speaking as though he were preaching at a church pulpit . I'd go so far as to say that my opinions about praying have changed . I only hope with all my heart that Mrs . Cruncher is praying right now . 
 There , there ! I hope she is , my dear man , cried Miss Pross . And I hope that her prayers are answered . 
 God forbid that anything I have ever said or done wrong would ever hurt our poor friends , continued Mr . Cruncher , even more seriously and more slowly . If it's possible , we should both pray to get our friends out of this risky situation ! God forbid , miss . That's what I say . Forbid it ! Mr . Cruncher tried to find a good ending to his speech , but this was the best he could do . 
 Meanwhile , Madame Defarge was still making her way through the streets and getting closer and closer . 
 If we ever get back to England , said Miss Pross , you can rely on my telling Mrs . Cruncher as much as I can remember and understand of what you have so impressively said . You can be sure that I will swear that you were completely serious about it at the time . Now , please , let's think of a plan ! My good Mr . Cruncher , let's think ! 
 Madame Defarge was still making her way through the streets and getting closer and closer . 
 Wouldn't it be best if you went on ahead , stopped the horses and carriage from coming here , and then waited for me somewhere else ? asked Miss Pross . 
 Mr . Cruncher thought that was best . 
 Where could you wait for me ? asked Miss Pross . 
 Mr . Cruncher was so confused that the only place he could think of was Temple Bar . Unfortunately Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away , and Madame Defarge was getting very close . 
 The door of Notre Dame cathedral , said Miss Pross . Would it be too much out of your way to meet me near the big cathedral door between the two towers ? 
 No , miss , answered Mr . Cruncher . 
 Then go to the posting house right away , like a good man , and change our arrangements , said Miss Pross . 
 I am worried about leaving you . We don't know what could happen , said Mr . Cruncher , hesitating and shaking his head . 
 Heaven knows we don't , answered Miss Pross . But don't worry about me . Pick me up at the cathedral at three o'clock or as close to three as you can . I'm sure that that will be better than leaving from here . I'm certain of it . There ! Bless you , Mr . Cruncher ! Don't worry about me ! Worry about the lives of the people who depend on us ! 
 Miss Pross's grabbed his hands and begged him . This , along with her convincing argument , convinced Mr . Cruncher . He nodded encouragingly once or twice and immediately went out to change their arrangements . He left her by herself to follow later as she had suggested . 
 Miss Pross was relieved to have come up with a precaution that was already being put into action . She needed to dress herself in a way that wouldn't draw attention in the streets . This activity was another relief to her . She looked at her watch . It was twenty minutes past two . She couldn't waste any time . She had to get ready at once . 
 She was distressed and afraid to be alone in the empty rooms . She kept thinking she saw faces peeking out from behind every open door . Miss Pross got a basin of cold water and splashed water on her eyes , which were swollen and red from crying . She was so bothered by her fears that she couldn't bear to have her sight obstructed by the dripping water for even a minute . She kept pausing and looking around to make sure no one was watching her . In one of those pauses , she drew back and screamed , for she saw someone standing in the room . 
 The basin fell and broke on the ground , and the water flowed to the feet of Madame Defarge . Many strange circumstances and much spilling of blood had brought her feet there . 
 Madame Defarge looked at her coldly and said , Where is Evremonde's wife ? 
 It occurred to Miss Pross that all the doors were open and it would show that they had all fled the city . The first thing she did was close them , and then she moved in front of the door of Lucie's room . 
 Madame Defarge watched her with her dark eyes as she moved quickly around the room and stared at her after she was finished . There was nothing beautiful about Miss Prossage had not made her appearance less wild or less grimbut Miss Pross was a determined woman in her own way . She looked Madame Defarge up and down . 
 You look like you could be the devil's wife , said Miss Pross , breathing heavily . Even so , you won't get the better of me . I am an Englishwoman . 
 Madame Defarge looked at her with contempt , but she understood along with Miss Pross that they were challenging one another . Madame Defarge saw a tight , hard , wiry woman in front of her . She noticed the same things that Mr . Lorry had noticed about her many years ago . She knew very well that Miss Pross was a devoted friend to the Manette family , and Miss Pross knew very well that Madame Defarge was an enemy of the Manette family . 
 I'm on my way to the execution , said Madame Defarge , gesturing slightly with her hand in the direction of the guillotine . They save my seat for me and have my knitting ready for me there . I've come to give my compliments to Lucie on my way . I want to see her . 
 I know that your intentions are evil , said Miss Pross . You can trust that I will hold my own in fighting against them . 
 Miss Pross spoke English and Madame Defarge spoke French , and neither understood the other . Both were watching each other carefully and trying to guess from the other's behavior what they were saying . 
 It won't help Lucie to hide from me right now , said Madame Defarge . Good patriots will know what it means if she does . Let me see her . Go tell her that I want to see her . Do you hear me ? 
 If your eyes were bed winches a machine for lifting loads made of a rope or chain wound around a cylinder bed winches and I was an English four-poster bed , they wouldn't get a splinter out of me . No , you wicked , foreign woman . I am your match . 
 Madame Defarge didn't follow these remarks very closely , but she understood them enough to know that Miss Pross wasn't going to go get Lucie . 
 You stupid pig ! said Madame Defarge , frowning . You're not answering me . I demand to see her . Either tell her that I demand to see her or get out of the way of the door and let me go see her myself ! She waved her right arm angrily as she said this . 
 I never thought that I would ever want to understand your ridiculous language , but I would give all I have , besides the clothes I'm wearing now , to know whether you suspect the truth , or any part of it . 
 Neither one of them would stop staring into the other's eyes for a single moment . Madame Defarge hadn't moved from where she stood when Miss Pross first realized she was there , but now she moved forward one step . 
 I am British , said Miss Pross . I am desperate , and I don't care two pennies for myself . I know that the longer I keep you here , the greater the hope is for Lucie . I will tear all of your dark hair clean off your head if you lay a finger on me ! 
 As Miss Pross spoke , she shook her head , glaring at Madame Defarge and taking a breath between every quick sentence . Miss Pross had threatened her , though she had never hit anyone in her life . 
 Her courage made her so emotional that it brought tears into her eyes . Madame Defarge misunderstood this as weakness . Ha , ha ! she laughed . You pitiful , worthless woman . I'll speak to Dr . Manette . Then she raised her voice and called out , Citizen doctor ! Wife of Evremonde ! Child of Evremonde ! Anyone here but this miserable fool I'm talking to , answer me ! 
 Maybe it was the silence that followed , or the expression on Miss Pross's face , or a sudden worry that had nothing to do with either , but something made Madame Defarge think that they might all be gone . She opened three of the doors quickly and looked into the other rooms . 
 Those rooms are all a mess . Someone has been packing quickly , and there are odds and ends on the ground . There is no one in that room behind you , is there ? Let me look . 
 Never ! said Miss Pross , who understood the request as perfectly as Madame Defarge understood the answer . 
 If they aren't in that room , then they are gone . They can be chased and brought back , Madame Defarge thought . 
 As long as you don't learn whether they are in that room or not , you won't know what to do , Miss Pross thought . And you won't learn that if I can help it . Whether you know that or not , you will stay here as long as I can keep you here . 
 I have been fighting in the streets since the beginning of the Revolution , and nothing has stopped me . I will tear you to pieces if I have to , but I will move you away from that door , said Madame Defarge . 
 We are alone at the top of a tall house in an empty courtyard . No one is likely to hear us . I pray for the physical strength to keep you here . Every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to my darling Lucie , said Miss Pross . 
 Madame Defarge moved toward the door . Miss Pross instinctively grabbed her around the waist with both arms and held onto her tightly . It was pointless for Madame Defarge to struggle and hit at her . Miss Pross held on to her tightly with the strength of love , which is always much stronger than hate . She even lifted her up off the floor while they struggled , and Madame Defarge beat and tore at Miss Pross's face with her hands . Miss Pross kept her head down and held her around her waist , clinging to her with the force of a drowning woman . 
 Soon , Madame Defarge stopped hitting Miss Pross and reached for the knife hidden at her waist . Your knife is under my arm , said Miss Pross . Her voice was stifled as they struggled . You won't draw it . I'm stronger than you , thank Heaven . I'll hold you until one or the other of us faints or dies ! 
 Madame Defarge's hands reached for her bosom . Miss Pross looked up and saw that she had grabbed her pistol . She struck at it , and there was a flash and a crash . Miss Pross stood there alone , blinded by smoke . 
 All of this happened in a second , and there was an awful stillness as the smoke cleared . The smoke moved through the air like the soul of Madame Defarge , whose body lied lifeless on the ground . 
 At first , Miss Pross was frightened and horrified , and she moved as far away from the body as she could . She ran downstairs to call for help , even though it was useless . Fortunately , she thought about the consequences of what she had done in time to stop herself and go back upstairs . It was awful for her to go in the room again , but she went back inside . She even went near the body to get the bonnet and other things that she needed to wear . She went out into the staircase and got dressed , but first she locked the door and took the key . She sat down on the stairs for a few moments to catch her breath and cry , and then she got up and hurried away . 
 Luckily she had a veil on her bonnet . Otherwise she wouldn't have been able to go through the streets without being stopped . Luckily , too , she always looked so strange that the dishevelment on her wasn't as obvious as it would have been on any other woman . She needed both of these advantages , for there were deep marks on her face from Madame Defarge's gripping fingers . Her hair was torn , and her dress , which she had quickly adjusted with her trembling hands , had been pulled and tugged a hundred different ways . 
 She dropped the key to the front door in the river as she crossed the bridge and arrived at the cathedral a few minutes before Jerry . While she was waiting , she thought , What if the key had already been caught in a net and identified ? What if they opened the door and discovered Madame Defarge's body ? What if I am stopped at the gate , sent to prison , and charged with murder ? While she was thinking these thoughts , Jerry appeared . He took her into the carriage and took her away . 
 Is there any noise in the streets ? she asked him . 
 The usual noises , answered Mr . Cruncher . He was surprised by the question and surprised by the way she looked . 
 I didn't hear you , said Miss Pross . What did you say ? 
 It was pointless for Mr . Cruncher to repeat what he had said . Miss Pross couldn't hear him . I'll nod my head , thought Mr . Cruncher , amazed . She'll see that no matter what . And she did . 
 Is there any noise in the streets now ? asked Miss Pross again . 
 Mr . Cruncher nodded his head again . 
 I don't hear it . 
 Has she gone deaf in the last hour ? Mr . Cruncher asked himself , thinking it over , disturbed . What's happened to her ? 
 I feel as if there was a flash and a crash , and that crash was the last thing I'll ever hear in my life , said Miss Pross . 
 She's is a strange state , said Mr . Cruncher , becoming more and more disturbed . Has she been taking something to keep her courage up ? Listen ! There's the roll of those dreadful carts ! You can hear that , can't you , miss ? 
 I can't hear anything , said Miss Pross , seeing that he was speaking to her . Oh , my good man . First there was a loud crash and then silence . That silence seems to be permanent and constant . It will never be broken as long as I live . 
 If she can't hear the rolling of those dreadful carts , which are now very close to their journey's end , said Mr . Cruncher , looking over his shoulder , I think that she will never hear anything else in this world . 
 And indeed she never did . 
 The empty death carts rumble harshly along the streets of Paris . Six carts carry the prisoners who are to be executed that day to the guillotine . The guillotine is like all of the devouring , ravenous monsters that have ever been imagined , combined into one . And yet even in France , with its rich soil and good weather , there isn't a blade of grass , a leaf , a root , a sprig , or a single peppercorn that will grow to maturity more predictably than the Revolution did . If people are beaten down again like this , the same horrible thing will happen . If greed and oppression are allowed to grow again , it will produce a similar result . 
 Six carts roll along the streets . Time , you powerful magician ! Change these back to the innocent farm carts that they used to be and you would see that they were the carriages of ruling monarchs and feudal nobles , the dressing rooms of prostitutes , the churches that are not houses of God but dens of thieves , the huts of millions of starving peasants . No , the great magician who does God's work never reverses what he has changed . If you were changed into this shape by God , say the seers to the enchanted in the wise Arabian stories , then you must stay that way ! But if you've been changed by mere magic , then return to your former shape ! The tumbrils will not change back to what they were . They continue to roll along the streets . 
 As the somber wheels of the six carts roll along , they clear a long , crooked path through the crowds in the streets . People move to either side , and the tumbrils move forward steadily . The people living in the houses nearby are so used to the tumbrils coming through that many of them don't even look out their windows . Other people don't even pause in their work as they look at the people in the tumbrils . Some houses have visitors that have come to see the tumbrils go by . Their host points his finger at one cart after another like the curator of a museum , and explains to them who was carted to the guillotine yesterday and two days before . 
 Some of the people riding in the tumbrils look at these things , and look at everything else , with a blank stare . Others look on with a lingering interest in the ways of life . Some are seated with their heads down and sunk into silent despair . Some are so aware of their appearance that they look out at the crowds with looks they have seen in plays or in paintings . Several close their eyes and try to gather their thoughts together . Only one miserable creature looks crazed . He is so distraught and horrified that he sings and tries to dance . None of them tries to appeal by their looks or their gestures to the pity of the people in the crowd . 
 There is a group of horsemen riding alongside the tumbrils . People in the crowd often look up at them and ask them questions . It always seems to be the same question , for after the question is asked , people rush over to the third cart . The horsemen beside that cart often point out one man in it with their swords . Everyone wants to know who he is . He is standing at the back of the tumbril with his head down , talking to a peasant girl who sits next to him in the cart and holds his hand . He doesn't care about what's happening around him and always talks to the girl . People all along St . Honore Street yell at him . He only smiles quietly , if he reacts at all , and shakes his hair a little more loosely over his face . His arms are tied , so he can't touch his face . 
 Barsad and the other prison spies wait for the tumbrils on the steps of the church . He looks into the first tumbril , but he's not there . He looks into the second one too , but he's not there . He's already wondering , Has he betrayed me ? Then he looks into the third tumbril and feels relieved as he sees him . 
 Which one is Evremonde ? asks a man behind him . 
 That one . At the back there . 
 Holding the girl's hand ? 
 Yes . 
 The man yells , Down with Evremonde ! Send all aristocrats to the guillotine ! Down with Evremonde ! 
 Hush , hush ! Barsad says to him timidly . 
 And why not , citizen ? 
 He's going to pay for his crimes . He will be dead in five minutes . Leave him alone . 
 But the man continues to yell , Down with Evremonde ! Carton , pretending to be Evremonde , turns toward the man for a moment . Then Carton sees Barsad . He looks at him carefully , and goes his way . 
 The clocks are striking three . The carts are pushing through the crowd the other way and arriving at the place where people are executed . The people who have moved out of the way of the carts on either side now crowd in behind the last cart as it moves on , for they are all following to the guillotine . In front of it , a number of women sit in chairs as if they were in a public garden . They are busy knitting . The Vengeance is standing on one of the chairs in the front looking around for Madame Defarge . 
 Therese ! she yells in her shrill voice . Has anyone seen her ? Therese Defarge ! 
 She's never missed an execution before , says another of the knitting women . 
 No , and she won't miss it now , yells The Vengeance sullenly . 
 Yell louder , suggests the other woman . 
 Yes ! Yell louder , Vengeance . Yell much louder and she won't come . Yell even louder , Vengeance , and yell a little oath with it , and she still won't come . Send other women all over to look for her . And yet , even though the people you send have done terrible things , it's doubtful they will be willing to die to find her ! 
 What bad luck ! yells The Vengeance , stomping her foot on the chair . And here are the tumbrils ! And Evremonde will be killed in just a moment . And she's not here ! See ! Her knitting is in my hand and her empty chair is ready for her . I'm so angry and disappointed I will cry ! 
 As The Vengeance gets down off of her chair to cry , the tumbrils begin to unload the prisoners . The executioners at the guillotine are dressed and ready . There is a crash . Someone's head is cut off and held up to the crowd . The knitting women , who hardly looked at the head a moment ago when it was alive , count one . 
 The second tumbril empties and moves on . The third comes up . There is a crash . The knitting women , who never stop knitting , count two . 
 The man who is supposedly Evremonde climbs down from the tumbril . The seamstress is lifted out after him . He doesn't let go of her hand as he gets out , but is still holding it as he promised . He gently places her with her back to the guillotine . The blade is constantly whirring up to the top and then falling down again . She looks into his face and thanks him . 
 If not for you , dear stranger , I wouldn't be so calm . I am a poor little thing and am weak . Nor would I have been able to turn my thoughts to Him who died so that we could have hope and comfort here today . I think you were sent to me by Heaven . 
 Or you to me , says Sydney Carton . Keep looking at me , dear child , and don't worry about anything else . 
 I don't worry about anything while I hold your hand . I won't worry about anything when I let it go either , if they kill me quickly . 
 They will be quick . Don't be afraid ! 
 The two of them stand in the quickly shrinking group of victims . But they are speaking as if they are alone . Their looks , their voices , their hands , and their hearts are connected . These two children of the earth , the Universal Mother , who are otherwise so different , have come together on the way to their deaths , to rest in her bosom . 
 My brave , generous friend . Will you let me ask you one last question ? I don't understand something , and it bothers me a little . 
 What is it ? 
 I have a cousin . She is my only relative . She is an orphan , like me , and I love her very much . She is five years younger than I am , and she lives in a farmhouse in the south country . We had to leave each other because we were so poor . She doesn't know that I am about to die because I don't know how to write and couldn't send her a letter . Even if I could , how would I tell her ? It's better that she doesn't know . 
 Yes , yes . It's better that she doesn't know . 
 What I've been thinking as we rolled along , and what I'm still thinking now , as I look into your kind , strong face that gives me so much support , is this : If the Republic really does help the poor , and they become less hungry and suffer less , she may live a long time . She may even live to be an old woman . 
 What then , my gentle sister ? 
 Do you think that it will seem like a long time to me while I wait for her in Heaven , where I am sure you and I will both go when we die ? As she speaks her uncomplaining eyes fill with tears , and her lips tremble . 
 It won't seem long , my dear child . There is no time in Heaven , and no troubles there . 
 You are so comforting to me ! I am so ignorant . Should I kiss you now ? Is it time ? 
 Yes . 
 She kisses his lips , and he kisses hers . They bless each other . Her hand isn't trembling when he lets go of it , and the expression on her face is sweet , bright , and strong . She goes to the guillotine before him , and is gone . The knitting women count twenty-two . 
 I am the resurrection and the life , says the Lord , Carton thought . He that believes in me , even though he is dead , will live . Whoever lives and believes in me will never die . 
 Carton hears the murmuring of many voices in the crowd . He sees many faces turned up toward him and looking at him . He sees people on the outside of the crowd push in so that the whole crowd moves forward like a wave . Then there is a flash and it all goes away . Twenty-three . 
 ***
 It was said in Paris that night that Carton had the most peaceful look on his face that anyone had ever seen on someone sent to the guillotine . Many people added that he looked almost heavenly , and like a prophet . 
 One of the most remarkable people who died that same day at the guillotine was a woman who had asked at the foot of that same scaffold earlier if she could write down what she was thinking . If Carton had said what he had been thinking , and if he had been able to see into the future , he would have said this : 
 I see Barsad , Cly , Defarge , The Vengeance , Jacques Three the juryman , the judge , the many new tyrants that have taken over after destroying the old , all dying at the guillotine , before it stops being used . I see the beautiful city of Paris and the wonderful people of France rising up from this abyss , In their struggles to be truly free , in their triumphs and defeats for many years to come , I see the evil of this time , and the evil of the time before that caused the Revolution , gradually making amends for itself and dying out . 
 I see the people for which I died living peaceful , useful , successful , and happy lives back in the England I will never see again . I see Lucie with a child on her breast who is named after me . I see Dr . Manette , who is old and bent over but otherwise healthy again . He is treating patients and is at peace . I see Mr . Lorry , who has been their friend for so long , enriching their lives for ten years , and dying tranquilly . 
 I see that I hold a special place in their hearts and in the hearts of future generations of their family . I see Lucie as an old woman , crying for me on the anniversary of the day I died . I see her and Charles dying and lying next to each other in their graves . I know that they honored me in their souls as much as they honored each other . 
 I see that child who lay on Lucie's breast and who was named after me becoming a man and succeeding as a lawyer . I see him being so successful that he brings honor to my name by his actions . I see the damage I had done to my name through my bad behavior fade away . I see him , the best of just judges and honored men , having a boy and naming it after me . The boy has a wrinkled forehead and blond hair like Lucie's . I see him bringing the boy here , which by then is a beautiful place without a trace of the guillotine to be seen . I hear him tell the child my story tenderly and emotionally . 
 It is a far , far better thing that I do than I have ever done . It is a far , far better rest that I go to than I have ever known .
