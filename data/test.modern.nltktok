 The expression on her forehead revealed her compassion for the prisoner .
 This expression was so heartbreaking that it moved even those people who had had no pity for the prisoner .
 The crowd whispered to one another , Who are they .
 Jerry , who had been observing the scene while he sucked the rust off of his fingers , leaned in to hear who they were .
 The crowd around him had passed the question forward to the person closest to the two people .
 The answer was slowly passed back until it got to Jerry : 
 They are witnesses .
 Against .
 Against which side .
 Against the prisoner .
 When the attorney general finished , the crowd started to buzz with excitement , like a cloud of flies , in anticipation of the prisoner's death .
 When the noise died down , the ideal patriot the attorney general had described entered the witness box .
 The man asked John Barsad if he had ever been a spy himself .
 No , Barsad answered indignantly .
 How did he make his living .
 He made his living off of his property .
 Where was his property .
 He didn't quite remember .
 What was this property .
 No one's business .
 Had he inherited it .
 Yes , he had .
 From whom .
 A distant relative .
 Very distant .
 Yes , very distant .
 Had he ever been in prison .
 Of course not .
 He had never been to debtor's prison .
 He didn't see what that has to do with it .
 So he'd never been to debtor's prison .
 He asked that the question be repeated .
 Never been to debtor's prison .
 Yes .
 How many times .
 Two or three times .
 Not five or six times .
 Maybe .
 What's your profession .
 I am a gentleman .
 Have you been ever been kicked in a fight .
 Maybe .
 Often .
 No .
 Ever been kicked down a flight of stairs .
 Of course not .
 Once , though , someone kicked me at the top of a staircase and I happened to fall down the stairs on my own .
 Were you kicked because you'd been caught cheating at dice .
 That's what the drunken liar who kicked me said , but it wasn't true .
 You swear it wasn't true .
 Definitely .
 Ever make money by cheating at gambling .
 Never .
 Ever make money by gambling .
 No more than other gentlemen .
 Ever borrow money from the prisoner .
 Yes .
 Ever pay him back .
 No .
 Wasn't your familiarity with the prisoner actually very limited , created by you deliberately bumping into him in coaches , inns , and ships .
 No .
 Are you sure you saw the prisoner with these lists .
 I'm sure .
 You didn't know anything else about these lists .
 No .
 You didn't get them yourself , for instance .
 No .
 Do you expect to get anything in return for testifying against him .
 No .
 You're not employed by the British government to entrap people .
 Of course not .
 Or to do anything else .
 No .
 You swear .
 I'll swear it over and over again .
 You have no motives for doing this other than love for your country .
 None whatsoever .
 There was another buzz in the courtroom , and the attorney general called MrJarvis Lorry to the stand .
 MrJarvis Lorry , are you a clerk at Tellson's Bank .
 I am .
 On a certain Friday night in November 1775 , did your job require that you take the mail coach from London to Dover .
 It did .
 Were there any other passengers in the coach .
 Two other passengers .
 Did they get out of the coach at some point during the night .
 Yes , they did .
 MrLorry , look at the prisoner .
 Was he one of those two passengers .
 I don't know .
 Does he resemble either of the two passengers .
 Both of them were bundled up , it was dark , and we all kept to ourselves , so I can't be sure if he looked like one of the passengers or not .
 MrLorry , imagine the prisoner wrapped up like those two passengers .
 Is there anything about his build or height that would make you think that he was not one of them .
 No .
 MrLorry , you cannot say for sure that he was not one of those two men .
 No .
 So you're saying he might have been one of them .
 Yes .
 Except that I remember them both being afraid of thieves , like I was , and the prisoner doesn't look like a man who's afraid of anything .
 Did you ever see someone pretend to be afraid , MrLorry .
 I certainly have .
 MrLorry , look at the prisoner again .
 Have you ever seen him before .
 I have .
 When .
 What time did he come on board .
 A little after midnight .
 In the middle of the night .
 Was he the only passenger that came on board so late .
 Forget about whether he ëhappened' to be the only one .
 Was he the only passenger to come on board in the middle of the night .
 Yes , he was .
 Were you traveling alone , MrLorry , or were you with someone .
 I was with two other people .
 A gentleman and a lady .
 They are here in the courtroom .
 They are here .
 Did you speak with the prisoner .
 The young woman , whom everyone had been watching earlier , stood up , and the crowd turned to look at her .
 Her father stood up with her and kept his hand linked through her arm .
 Miss Manette , take a look at the prisoner .
 To look at such a young , beautiful woman with such pity in her eyes was harder for the prisoner than the stares of the entire crowd .
 He couldn't stand still while looking at her , knowing he was about to die and knowing that everyone was watching him .
 He brushed the herbs in front of him into little lines , like beds of flowers in a garden .
 His lips trembled as he tried to steady his breathing .
 The crowd started to buzz again .
 Miss Manette , have you seen the prisoner before .
 Yes , sir .
 Where .
 You are the young woman MrLorry referred to .
 Oh .
 Unfortunately , I am .
 Miss Manette , did you talk to the prisoner at all during the journey across the Channel .
 Yes , sir .
 Describe the conversation .
 The courtroom was silent as she began quietly : When the gentleman came on board .
 By ëgentleman , ' do you mean the prisoner .
 asked the judge , frowning .
 Yes , my lord .
 Then say ëthe prisoner .
 Let me interrupt you for a moment .
 Did he come on board alone .
 No .
 How many people were with him .
 Two French gentlemen .
 Did they speak together .
 They spoke together until the very last moment , when the two French gentlemen took their boat back to shore .
 They passed some papers between them , but I don't know what they were .
 Were they the same shape and size as these papers .
 Tell us about your conversation with the prisoner , Miss Manette .
 The courtroom buzzed with excitement .
 Did he say anything about America , Miss Manette .
 Be specific .
 A crowd will always mimic the expression on the face of an actor in a play they are watching .
 Miss Manette's forehead was wrinkled up as she gave her evidence , waited for the judge to write down what she said , and watched the lawyers to see how they would react .
 All the people in the crowd had the same expression on their foreheads , as if they were mirrors reflecting Miss Manette .
 The judge looked up , angered by the comment about George Washington .
 Can you identify him as the man you met on board the boat from Calais , or verify that he had this conversation with your daughter .
 I can't do either , sir .
 Is there some reason why .
 There is , he answered quietly .
 A long imprisonment , he answered in a tone that provoked pity .
 Had you just been released on the night in question .
 That's what they tell me .
 Do you remember that night .
 Not at all .
 I don't remember anything from a long periodI can't even say how long .
 I've forgotten everything from the time when I was making shoes in prison to when I found myself living in London with my daughter .
 I began to recognize her when I started to get my senses back .
 I have no memory of how it happened , though .
 The witness said he was sure .
 Have you ever seen anyone who looked like the prisoner .
 Not so much like him that I could confuse the two , said the witness .
  Your confidence in me should be returned with confidence in you .
 You may remember that the name I go by now , although it is only slightly changed from my mother's , is not my own .
 I want to tell you what my name really is and why I am in England .
 said the doctor from Beauvais .
 Stop .
 Tell me when I ask you , not now .
 If you are successful and Lucie loves you , tell me the morning you get married .
 Do you promise .
 Of course .
 It was dark when Charles Darnay left , and it was darker an hour later when Lucie came home .
 She hurried into the room alone since Miss Pross had gone straight upstairs and was surprised to find the reading chair empty .
 Father .
 she called to him .
 Father dear .
 She got out of bed and went to watch him sleep that night .
 He slept heavily , and his tray of shoemaking tools and his unfinished shoes were all laid out the way they always were .
 Sydney Carton had been working twice as hard that night , and the night before .
 He had been working hard for many nights in a row , clearing out a lot of MrStryver's papers before going on a long vacation .
 The papers had finally been cleared out , and MrStryver's debts had been paid up .
 Everything was finished until November , when the weather would turn foggy , and legal matters would become complex and foggy too , and there would be work for him again .
 I am .
 Do you .
 Yes .
 And I'm not even marrying for money .
 What do you say to that .
 I don't have much to say .
 Who is she .
 Guess .
 Do I know her .
 Guess .
 And you , returned Sydney sarcastically , who was busy mixing the punch , are such a sensitive and poetic spirit .
 You're luckier , you mean .
 That's not what I mean .
 I mean I am a man of moremore .
 Say chivalry' while you're at it , suggested Carton .
 Go on , said Sydney Carton .
 It is good for a lawyer to be ashamed about something , answered Sydney .
 You should thank me .
 Sydney drank a large glass of the punch he had made and laughed .
 I've never seen you do it yet , Carton muttered to himself .
 I do it because it's smart to do it .
 I do it on principle .
 And look at me .
 I do well for myself .
 You aren't doing well with your story about your plans to marry , answered Carton casually .
 I wish you would stay on the subject .
 And back to medon't you understand that I am hopeless .
 He looked angry when he asked the question .
 You have no business being hopeless , answered Stryver harshly .
 I have no business being anything as far as I know , said Sydney Carton .
 Who is the lady .
 I did .
 You did .
 Right here in this apartment .
 Sydney Carton looked at his punch , and he looked at his satisfied friend .
 He drank his punch and looked at his friend again .
 Carton , still drinking his punch , answered Why should I be surprised .
 Do you approve .
 I'll think about it , said Sydney .
 Accordingly , MrStryver decided to begin his long vacation with a formal offer to take Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens .
 If that didn't work , he would take her to Ranelagh .
 If that failed too , he would go to her house in Soho and tell her how he felt about her there .
 Hello .
 said MrStryver .
 How do you do .
 I hope you are well .
 MrStryver's oddest characteristic was that he always appeared too big for whatever space he was in .
 He seemed so large in Tellson's that old clerks in far corners looked up in protest as though he were squeezing them against the wall .
 The head of the bank , reading a paper far away , lowered it unhappily , as if MrStryver had head-butted him in the stomach .
 Can I do anything for you , MrStryver .
 asked MrLorry in a professional way .
 Why , no , thank you .
 This is a personal visit , MrLorry .
 I have come to have a word with you in private .
 Oh dear me .
 yelled MrLorry , rubbing his chin and looking at MrStryver doubtfully .
 Oh , dear me , ' sir .
 repeated Stryver , pulling away .
 Oh , dear you , sir .
 What do you mean , MrLorry .
 MrLorry adjusted his little wig at his ears and bit the feather tip of his quill pen .
 Aren't I successful .
 asked Stryver .
 And aren't I becoming more successful .
 If the question is if you're becoming more successful , then no one can doubt that , said MrLorry , who was thrilled to be able to agree with him .
 Then what on earth do you mean , MrLorry .
 asked MrStryver , visibly hurt .
 Well .
 Iwere you on your way to Miss Manette's house right now .
 asked MrLorry .
 I'm going straight there .
 said Stryver , with a thump of his fat fist on the desk .
 I think I wouldn't do that if I were you .
 Because I wouldn't do such a thing unless I had some reason to think that I would succeed , said MrLorry .
 MrLorry looked at the head banker in the corner and looked back at MrStryver , who was now angry .
 Then what you're telling me , MrLorry , said Stryver turning toward him , is that you think Miss Manette is an idiot .
 Not exactly .
 What I mean , MrStryver , said MrLorry , who was turning red in the face , is that I will not let anyone speak badly of Miss Manette .
 If I knew any manand I hope I do notwho had such poor taste and such a bad temper that he couldn't keep himself from speaking badly of Miss Manette here at my desk , even the fact that we are in Tellson's Bank wouldn't stop me from telling him off .
 The fact that MrStryver was so angry but had to keep his voice down made his veins stand out .
 MrLorry's veins , as calm as they usually were , were just as bad now that it was his turn to speak .
 That is what I'm trying to tell you , sir , said MrLorry .
 Let's be clear about that .
 MrStryver sucked on the end of a ruler for a little while , then stood tapping the ruler against his teeth , which probably gave him a toothache .
 He broke the awkward silence by saying : 
 Are you asking me for advice , MrStryver .
 Yes , I am .
 Very good .
 Then I have given you my advice and you have repeated it correctly .
 All I can say to that , laughed Stryver , who was clearly annoyed , is that thisha , ha .
 This beats everything .
 Not I .
 said Stryver , whistling .
 I can't seem to find third parties with common sense .
 I can only find it in myself .
 I believe I have sense in certain matters .
 You believe nonsense .
 It's new to me , but I think you might be right .
 How long would I have to stay in town .
 Oh .
 Only a few hours .
 I could go to the Manette's house in Soho tonight and come to your apartment afterward .
 MrStryver was smart enough to realize that the banker wouldn't have said so much about his opinion unless he were sure of it .
 As unprepared as he was to receive MrLorry's unwanted advice , he followed it .
 And now , said MrStryver , pointing his finger and shaking it at all of Temple Bar , my way out of this is to prove you're all wrong .
 He soothed himself with a trick used by lawyers at the Old Bailey .
 You won't prove me wrong , Miss Manette , said MrStryver .
 I'll prove myself wrong .
 Well .
 said MrLorry pleasantly , after spending half an hour trying unsuccessfully to get MrStryver to bring up the subject .
 I have been to Soho .
 To Soho .
 repeated MrStryver indifferently .
 Oh , yes , of course .
 What was I thinking .
 And I'm sure , said Mrlorry , that I was right when we talked this morning .
 My opinion has been confirmed , and I repeat the same advice to you .
 I'm sorry for your sake and sorry for her father's sake , said MrStryver in his friendliest way .
 I know this must be a difficult subject for the family .
 Let's not talk about it again .
 I don't understand you , said MrLorry .
 Apparently not , he answered , nodding his head .
 It doesn't matter .
 But it does matter , MrLorry said .
 MrLorry was so surprised that he stared blankly at MrStryver as MrStryver shoved him toward the front door and pretended to be in a good mood .
 Make the best of it , my dear sir , said Stryver .
 Let's talk no more about it .
 Thanks again for allowing me to talk to get your opinion .
 Good night .
 If Sydney Carton ever made a good impression anywhere , it was certainly never at Dr .
 Manette's house .
 He had been going there regularly for a whole year , and he always spent his time there lying around in a grumpy mood .
 When he said anything , he spoke well , but his apathy cast a shadow over him , and his good heart rarely shined through .
 The servant brought him upstairs and he found Lucie working there alone .
 She had never been comfortable when he was around , and she was a little embarrassed when he arrived and sat down near her at her table .
 She looked at his face after they exchanged a few pleasantries and noticed that something was different about him .
 You look sick , MrCarton .
 No .
 But I live an unhealthy lifestyle , Miss Manette .
 What can you expect from someone as decadent as I am .
 God knows it's a shame that I don't .
 Then why not change the way you live .
 She looked at him gently again , surprised and sad to see that he was crying .
 His voice sounded sad , too , as he answered : 
 It's too late for that .
 I will never be better than I am now .
 I'll only get worse and worse .
 He leaned his elbow on the table and covered his eyes with his hand .
 The table trembled as he cried on it silently .
 She had never seen him so vulnerable , and it was upsetting to her .
 He could tell that she was upset , so without looking at her , he said : 
 Please forgive me , Miss Manette .
 I'm crying because of what I'm about to say to you .
  Let's say that during the dark times in his past , the patient used to work at a little forge .
 Let's say that we unexpectedly found him at his forge again .
 Isn't it bad for him to keep it close to him .
 The doctor covered his eyes with his hand and tapped his foot nervously on the ground .
 He has always kept it by him , said MrLorry , looking anxiously at the doctor .
 Now , wouldn't it be better to let it go .
 The doctor kept his eyes shaded and kept tapping his foot nervously on the ground .
 Do you find it difficult to give me advice .
 said MrLorry .
 I think it's a good question .
 And yet , I think Then he shook his head and stopped talking .
 He looked a lot like a lost child as he looked up at MrLorry .
 There was another silence .
 You see too , said the doctor , nervously , it is like an old friend .
 I wouldn't keep it , said MrLorry , shaking his head .
 He became more confident as he saw that the doctor was uneasy .
 I would tell the patient to give it up .
 I only lack your power to do it .
 I am sure it does no good .
 Come on .
 Give me your permission , like a good man .
 For his daughter's sake , my dear Manette .
 It was very strange to see the struggle going on within the doctor .
 For her sake , then , let it be done .
 I allow it .
 But I would not take it away while he is there .
 Take it away when is not there .
 Let him miss his old friend after he is gone .
 MrCarton waited until he had a chance to take Darnay aside to a window to speak to him privately .
 I hope that we are already friends , said MrDarnay .
 Naturally , Charles Darnay asked him what he meant .
 I remember a certain evening when you made me admit to you that you had been drinking .
 I'm not worried .
 When you are sincere it doesn't worry me at all .
 Ah .
 said Carton , waving his hand casually as if he were waving away MrDarnay's comment .
 On the drunken night in questionone of many drunken nights for me , as you knowI was rudely speaking about whether I liked you or disliked you .
 I hope you will forget all about it .
 I forgot about it a long time ago .
 You're just being polite again .
 But , MrDarnay , it is not as easy for me to forget things as you claim it is for you .
 I haven't forgotten it at all , and a casual answer doesn't help me forget it .
 Please forgive me if it was a casual answer , answered Darnay .
 I was only trying to take a minor incident that seems , to my surprise , to bother you too much and put it behind us .
 I give you my word as a gentleman that I forgot about it a long time ago .
 Good Heaven , what was there to forget .
 Didn't you do a great favor for me that day that I should remember .
 I need to tell you that the great favor I did for you was actually just professional nonsense , said Carton .
 I don't think that I cared what happened to you when I did it .
 Mind you , I'm saying that that is how I felt back then .
 I am speaking about the past .
 I would rather form my own opinion without hearing from MrStryver .
 Well , at any rate you know that I'm a depraved dog .
 I've never done anything good in my life and never will .
 I don't know if its true that you never will .
 Will you try to come .
 That's another way of saying that you will grant me what I've asked .
 Thank you , MrDarnay .
 I may say that you and I are friends .
 I should think by now that you would , MrCarton .
 They shook hands on the matter , and Sydney Carton turned away .
 Less than a minute afterward he was as unnoticeable as ever .
 He had no idea that his beautiful young wife might be thinking about MrCarton , too .
 But later , when he joined her in their own rooms , she was waiting for him with the usual pretty frown on her forehead .
 You look concerned about something tonight .
 said Darnay , putting his arm around her .
 Yes , dearest Charles , she said , with her hands on his chest , She looked at him with a questioning expression .
 I am rather concerned tonight , for I have something on my mind .
 What is it , my Lucie .
 Will you promise not to ask any questions of me if I ask you not to .
 Will I promise .
 What wouldn't I promise you , my love .
 He brushed her golden hair from her cheek and placed his other hand against her heart .
 I think , Charles , that poor MrCarton deserves more consideration and respect than you gave him tonight .
 Really , my love .
 Why do you say so .
 That is the question you shouldn't ask me .
 But I thinkI knowthat he does .
 If you know it , it's good enough for me .
 What do you want me to do , my darling .
 It hurts me to know that I treated him poorly , said Charles Darnay , surprised .
 I never knew this about him .
 Miss Manette's faith in MrCarton made her look so beautiful that her husband could have looked at her for hours .
 Darnay was moved by her request .
 I will always remember it , dear heart .
 I will remember it as long as I live .
 At first there were times when whatever she was working on would fall slowly out of her hands and she would look sad , even though overall she was a completely happy young wife .
 For there was something coming in the echoes , something far away and barely able to be heard , that upset her .
 She was caught between feelings of hope and doubthopes of a love still unknown to her and doubts that she would stay on earth long enough to enjoy that love .
 In the echoes she would hear the sound of footsteps at her own grave , as if she had died young , and she would think of her husband whom she had left so alone .
 In her imagination , he would mourn so much for her that his eyes would overflow with tears .
 In the years that she worked to bring them closer together and make them a happy family , Lucie heard in the echoes nothing but friendly and soothing sounds .
 Her husband was strong and prosperous .
 Her father was stable and healthy .
 Miss Pross was like an unruly charger a large , strong cavalry horse charger who had been tamed and domesticated , and snorted and pawed at the ground under the plane tree in the garden .
 MrStryver shoved his way toward success as a lawyer , like a ship plowing through rough waters , and dragged his helpful friend MrCarton along with him .
 Sydney , like a sinking boat , had a tough time being dragged along , but since he had always done so , he continued with that life .
 MrCarton's attachment to the life he was used to , unfortunately stronger in him than any desire to desert MrStryver or avoid the disgrace of this life , made that life the one MrCarton was to lead .
 He didn't think any more of being the jackal to MrStryver's lion than a real jackal would think of becoming a lion .
 Stryver was rich .
 He had married an old widow with property and three boys , who had nothing particularly exciting about them but the straight hair on their fat heads .
 But there were other echoes that were rumbling off in the distance all this time .
 And it was around Little Lucie's sixth birthday that they started to get louder , like a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising .
 One night in the middle of July 1789 , MrLorry came in late from Tellson's Bank and sat down by Lucie and her husband in the dark window .
 It was a hot , wild night , and they were all reminded of that Sunday night years before when they had sat in the same place and watched the lightning .
 I was starting to think that I'd have to spend the night at the bank , said MrLorry , pushing back his brown wig .
 We were so busy all day that we didn't know what to do first or where to go .
 There is such nervousness in Paris that there was actually a run to put money in Tellson's Bank .
 Our customers in Paris can't seem to transfer their property to us fast enough .
 They're all practically mad about sending their valuables to England .
 Looks bad , you say , my dear Darnay .
 Yes , but we don't know what sense there is in it .
 People can be so irrational .
 Some of us at Tellson's are getting old and can't be bothered with unusual things happening unless there's a good reason for it .
 Still , said Darnay , you know how gloomy and threatening the situation is over there .
 Here he is , said the doctor , coming into the dark room .
 I'm happy that you're at home .
 All of this anxiousness that I've been surrounded by all day has made me nervous for no reason .
 You're not going out , I hope .
 No .
 I'm going to play backgammon here with you , if you want , said the doctor .
 I don't think I want to , if I can speak my mind .
 I'm too worried to compete against you tonight .
 Is the tea tray still there , Lucie .
 I can't see it .
 Thank you , my dear .
 Your precious daughter is safe in bed .
 And sleeping soundly .
 It's not a theory .
 just something I like to imagine .
 It's your imagination then , my wise pet , said MrLorry , patting her hand .
 These echoes are very numerous and very loud , though , aren't they .
 Listen to them .
 Stay close to me , Jacques Three , yelled Defarge .
 And you , Jacques One and Two , split up and put yourselves in charge of as many of these patriots as you can .
 Where is my wife .
 Hey .
 Here I am .
 said Madame Defarge , as calm as ever , but not knitting today .
 Instead , Madame Defarge had an axe in her right hand and a pistol and a cruel-looking knife in her girdle .
 Where are you going , my wife .
 I'm going with you right now , said Madame Defarge .
 You'll see me leading the women soon .
 Come , then .
 yelled Defarge loudly .
 Patriots and friends , we are ready .
 To the Bastille .
 With a roar that sounded as if every person in France had yelled the word Bastille , the crowd of peasants rose up and overflowed the city .
 With alarm bells ringing , drums beating , and the crowd thundering like the sea , the attack began .
 Then there was one deep ditch , a single drawbridge , huge stone walls , eight large towers , cannon , muskets , fire , and smoke to contend with .
 One drawbridge had been taken down .
 Work , my friends , work .
 shouted Defarge .
 Work , Jacques One , Jacques Two , Jacques One Thousand , Jacques Two Thousand , Jacques Twenty-Five Thousand , in the name of all the angels or the devilswhichever you preferwork .
 So Defarge the wine seller yelled , still at his cannon , which had long before grown hot from firing .
 The force of the crowd that was sweeping him along was so powerful that he couldn't even catch a breath or turn his head until he was in the outer courtyard of the Bastille .
 There , pushed up against an angle of a wall , he struggled to look around .
 Jacques Three was almost beside him , and Madame Defarge could be seen inside in the distance , still leading some of her women .
 She had her knife in her hand .
 Everywhere there was commotion , celebration , confusion , and deafening noise .
 The prisoners .
 The records .
 The secret prison cells .
 The torture devices .
 The prisoners .
 Show me the North Tower .
 said Defarge .
 Quick .
 I promise I will if you will come with me , answered the man .
 But there is no one there .
 What does One Hundred and Five , North Tower mean .
 asked Defarge .
 Quick .
  He has been accused by the people of Saint Antoine .
 One more thing , the doctor asked .
 Will you tell me who accused him .
 It's against the rules for me to tell you , answered the first man .
 But you can ask the man from Saint Antoine here .
 Who was the other person .
 Are you asking me , Citizen Doctor .
 Then you will get your answer tomorrow , said the man from Saint Antoine with a strange look .
 For now , I say no more .
 As their wine was being measured out , a man got up from a corner where he had been sitting with another man and started to leave .
 As he went out , he came face-to-face with Miss Pross .
 As soon as he faced her , Miss Pross screamed and clapped her hands .
 What is the matter .
 said the man who had caused Miss Pross to scream .
 He spoke quickly , quietly , and in English .
 Don't call me Solomon .
 Do you want to get me killed .
 asked the man in a secretive , frightened way .
 Brother , brother .
 cried Miss Pross , bursting into tears .
 Have I ever treated you so badly that you can ask me such a cruel question .
 Then stop talking and come outside if you want to speak to me , said Solomon .
 Pay for your wine and come outside .
 Who's this man .
 He can come outside too , said Solomon .
 Does he think I'm a ghost .
 You are my brother , and I have always loved you , cried Miss Pross .
 How cruel it is for you to greet me this way and be so cold to me .
 Miss Pross shook her head and cried silently .
 If you expect me to be surprised , I'm not , said her brother .
 I knew you were here .
 I know about most people who are here .
 If you don't want to put my life in dangerand I half think you dogo your way as soon as possible , and let me go mine .
 I am busy .
 I am an official now .
 I told you .
 cried her brother , interrupting her .
 I knew it .
 You want to get me killed .
 I'll be made a suspect by my own sister .
 Just as I am starting to do well for myself .
 Heaven forbid .
 cried Miss Pross .
 I would rather never see you again , dear Solomon , though I have always loved you and always will .
 Say just one kind word to me and tell me there is no anger or conflict between us and I will let you go .
 Good Miss Pross .
 As if any conflict between them had been her fault .
 As if MrLorry had not known years ago in their house on the quiet corner in Soho that her precious brother , Solomon , had spent all of her money and abandoned her .
 May I ask you a question .
 Is you name John Solomon .
 Or Solomon John .
 Solomon turned toward him with sudden distrust .
 MrCruncher hadn't said a word until now .
 What do you mean .
 Well , I don't know exactly what I mean , because I can't remember what your name was back in England .
 But I'll swear it was a name with two syllables in it .
 The other name was one syllable .
 I know you .
 You were a spy who acted as a witness at the Bailey .
 In the name of the Father of Lies the devil Father of Lies , who was your father too , what name were you called back then .
 Barsad , said someone else , joining in .
 The man who had joined in was Sydney Carton .
 He had his hands behind him under his riding coat , and he stood beside MrCruncher as casually as he might have stood at the court of the Old Bailey .
 Don't be alarmed , my dear Miss Pross .
 I arrived at MrLorry's and surprised him last night .
 We agreed that I wouldn't make my presence known to anyone else until all was well or until I could be of use .
 I am showing myself here so I can ask your brother to have a little talk with me .
 I wish you had a brother with a more respectable job than MrBarsad .
 I wish for your sake that MrBarsad wasn't a prison sheep .
 Sheep was prison slang for spy at the time .
 Solomon , known as the spy Barsad , was pale , and he turned even paler and asked MrCarton how he dared .
 What purpose .
 the spy asked .
 It would be difficult and dangerous to explain in the street .
 Could you do me the favor of meeting with me for a few minutes in secret , at the office of Tellson's Bank for instance .
 Are you threatening me .
 Did I say that .
 If you're not threatening me , why should I go there .
 Do you mean that you won't tell me why , sir .
 asked the spy uncertainly .
 You understand me very well , MrBarsad .
 I won't tell you .
 Carton's casual manner helped his quickness and skill in putting his secret plan into action and dealing with a man like Barsad .
 He noticed this advantage and used it .
 Come , come , MrBarsad , exclaimed Sydney .
 Don't be ungrateful .
 If it weren't for the great respect I have for your sister , I might not have presented my little proposal so nicely .
 I think it will benefit both of us .
 Will you go with me to the bank .
 I'll listen to what you have to say .
 Yes , I'll go with you .
 I suggest that we escort your sister to the corner of her street first .
 Let me take your arm , Miss Pross .
 This isn't a good city for you to be out unprotected at this time .
 And as MrCruncher knows MrBarsad , I will invite him to MrLorry's with us .
 Are we ready .
 Come on then .
 This is MrBarsad , sir .
 I told you that you had a memorable face , MrBarsad , said Carton , coolly .
 Please sit down .
 As he took a chair , he supplied the information MrLorry was looking for by saying with a frown , I was a witness at that trial .
 MrLorry remembered immediately and looked at MrBarsad with a clear look of hatred .
 Arrested just the same .
 When was he arrested , MrBarsad .
 Just now , if he was already arrested .
 He might not have known about it beforehand , said MrLorry .
 But that's alarming when you remember how close everyone knows he is with Darnay .
 You'll need good cards to win me over , sir , said Barsad .
 I'll look them over and see what I hold .
 MrLorry , you know what a brute I am and I how much I like to drink .
 Please give me a little brandy .
 I don't understand what you plan to do , answered Barsad , uneasily .
 I plan to play my ace and denounce you , MrBarsad , to the closest Section Committee .
 Look over your hand , MrBarsad , and see what cards you have to play .
 Take your time .
 MrCarton pulled the bottle of brandy toward him , poured himself another glass , and drank it .
 He saw that Barsad was worried he would get drunk and want to denounce Barsad immediately .
 Seeing this , Carton poured another glass and drank it .
 Look over your cards carefully , MrBarsad .
 Take your time .
 You don't seem to like your cards , said Sydney calmly .
 Will you play your hand .
 I will play my ace in a few minutes and accuse you , MrBarsad , without any doubts , said Carton , answering himself and looking at his watch .
 There is no better way for me to prove that I respect your sister than to finally relieve her of her brother , said Sydney Carton .
 I have completely made my mind up about it , answered Carton .
 Now that I think about it , I'm pretty sure I have another good card here that I haven't mentioned yet .
 That friend and fellow spy who said he spends time in the prisons .
 You don't know him , said Barsad , quickly .
 French , huh .
 repeated Carton , thinking it over .
 He didn't seem to notice Barsad at all , although he repeated the word after him .
 Well , he might be .
 He is , I assure you , said Barsad .
 Though it's not important .
 I don't think so .
 I'm sure you don't .
 You can't , said Barsad .
 He's from the countryside , said Barsad .
 cried Carton , hitting the table with his open hand as it became clear to him .
 Cly .
 He was disguised , but that was Cly .
 That man was at the trial at the Old Bailey .
 From where he was sitting , MrLorry suddenly became aware of a strange goblin-like shadow on the wall .
 He looked to where it was coming from and discovered that it was caused by MrCruncher's hair , which had suddenly risen and stiffened even more than usual .
 MrLorry saw the shadow on the wall grow longer , and MrCruncher stepped forward .
 His hair could not have been standing up any more if it had been arranged by the cow with the crumpled horn in the house that Jack built the quote , which describes a cowlick , is from This Is the House That Jack Built , by Mother Goose the cow with the crumpled horn in the house that Jack built .
 Barsad didn't see MrCruncher standing beside him , and MrCruncher tapped him on the shoulder .
 So you put Roger Cly in his coffin , master .
 asked MrCruncher , coldly .
 I did .
 Who took him out of it .
 I mean that he was never in it , said MrCruncher .
 No .
 He wasn't .
 You can chop off my head if he was ever in it .
 Barsad looked around at MrCarton and MrLorry .
 They both looked at Jerry in astonishment .
 I tell you that you buried cobblestones and dirt in that coffin , said Jerry .
 Don't tell me that you buried Cly .
 It was a scam .
 I and two more people know it .
 How do you know .
 No .
 answered Barsad .
 I give up .
 I confess that we were so unpopular with the mob that I only got away from England at the risk of being drowned to death , and that Cly was being chased so much that he never would have gotten away if he hadn't faked his own death .
 Though how MrCruncher knows that it was a scam I have no idea .
 Not very much .
 You are a prison guard at the Conciergerie .
 I'll tell you for sure that there is no way to escape , said Barsad , firmly .
 Why are you telling me what I didn't ask .
 You are a guard at the Conciergerie .
 I am sometimes .
  Clearly they were forming plots , said Jacques Three .
 It couldn't be more clear .
 You can count on the patriotic jury , citizeness .
 I speak for my fellow jurymen .
 Now , let me see , said Madame Defarge , thinking it over again .
 Let me think it over just once more .
 Can I let this doctor live for my husband's sake .
 I don't care either way .
 Can I spare him .
 He would be one more head , said Jacques Three quietly .
 We really don't have enough heads as it is .
 It would be a pity to let him live , I think .
 The Vengeance and Jacques Three both tried to outdo each other in saying that she was the most admirable and marvelous witness .
 The little wood sawyer didn't want to be outdone and called her a celestial witness .
 He must take his chances , said Madame Defarge .
 No , I cannot spare him .
 You are busy at three o'clock .
 You are going to see the people who are to be executed today .
 You .
 I will be doing the same thing there , said madame .
 After it's overlet's say at eight o'clock tonightcome to see me in Saint Antoine and we will go accuse these people at my Section .
 Madame Defarge beckoned to Jacques Three and The Vengeance to come closer to the door , and then she elaborated on her thoughts : 
 I'll be there before they begin .
 She didn't care that an innocent man was about to die for the sins of his ancestors .
 She saw them , not him .
 She didn't care that his wife was about to become a widow and his daughter an orphan .
 That wasn't enough punishment , because they were her natural enemies and prey , and so they had no right to live .
 It was useless to appeal to her , since she had no pity , even for herself .
 If she had been struck down in the streets in one of the many battles she had been involved in , she wouldn't have pitied herself .
 If she were sent to the guillotine to die tomorrow , she wouldn't feel anything but a strong desire to see the person who sent her there killed instead .
 I think you're right , miss , answered MrCruncher .
 Either way , I'll do what you want , right or wrong .
 I am so troubled with fear and hope for our friends that I am unable to form a plan , said Miss Pross , crying wildly .
 Are you able to form any plan , MrCruncher .
 I hope I will be able to in the future , answered MrCruncher .
 Right now , I'm not able to think of anything .
 Would you do me a favor , miss , and listen to two promises and vows that I want to have on record here in this crisis .
 Whatever situation you have at home , said Miss Pross , trying to dry her eyes and compose herself , I know it's best that MrsCruncher is able to do what she wants .
 Oh , my poor friends .
 Meanwhile , Madame Defarge was still making her way through the streets and getting closer and closer .
 If we ever get back to England , said Miss Pross , you can rely on my telling MrsCruncher as much as I can remember and understand of what you have so impressively said .
 You can be sure that I will swear that you were completely serious about it at the time .
 Now , please , let's think of a plan .
 My good MrCruncher , let's think .
 Madame Defarge was still making her way through the streets and getting closer and closer .
 Wouldn't it be best if you went on ahead , stopped the horses and carriage from coming here , and then waited for me somewhere else .
 asked Miss Pross .
 MrCruncher thought that was best .
 Where could you wait for me .
 asked Miss Pross .
 The door of Notre Dame cathedral , said Miss Pross .
 Would it be too much out of your way to meet me near the big cathedral door between the two towers .
 No , miss , answered MrCruncher .
 Then go to the posting house right away , like a good man , and change our arrangements , said Miss Pross .
 I am worried about leaving you .
 We don't know what could happen , said MrCruncher , hesitating and shaking his head .
 The basin fell and broke on the ground , and the water flowed to the feet of Madame Defarge .
 Many strange circumstances and much spilling of blood had brought her feet there .
 You look like you could be the devil's wife , said Miss Pross , breathing heavily .
 Even so , you won't get the better of me .
 I am an English woman .
 Madame Defarge looked at her with contempt , but she understood along with Miss Pross that they were challenging one another .
 Madame Defarge saw a tight , hard , wiry woman in front of her .
 She noticed the same things that MrLorry had noticed about her many years ago .
 She knew very well that Miss Pross was a devoted friend to the Manette family , and Miss Pross knew very well that Madame Defarge was an enemy of the Manette family .
 It won't help Lucie to hide from me right now , said Madame Defarge .
 Good patriots will know what it means if she does .
 Let me see her .
 Go tell her that I want to see her .
 Do you hear me .
 If your eyes were bed winches a machine for lifting loads made of a rope or chain wound around a cylinder bed winches and I was an English four-poster bed , they wouldn't get a splinter out of me .
 No , you wicked , foreign woman .
 I am your match .
 You stupid pig .
 said Madame Defarge , frowning .
 You're not answering me .
 I demand to see her .
 Either tell her that I demand to see her or get out of the way of the door and let me go see her myself .
 She waved her right arm angrily as she said this .
 I am British , said Miss Pross .
 I am desperate , and I don't care two pennies for myself .
 I know that the longer I keep you here , the greater the hope is for Lucie .
 I will tear all of your dark hair clean off your head if you lay a finger on me .
 As Miss Pross spoke , she shook her head , glaring at Madame Defarge and taking a breath between every quick sentence .
 Miss Pross had threatened her , though she had never hit anyone in her life .
 Maybe it was the silence that followed , or the expression on Miss Pross's face , or a sudden worry that had nothing to do with either , but something made Madame Defarge think that they might all be gone .
 She opened three of the doors quickly and looked into the other rooms .
 Never .
 said Miss Pross , who understood the request as perfectly as Madame Defarge understood the answer .
 As long as you don't learn whether they are in that room or not , you won't know what to do , Miss Pross thought .
 And you won't learn that if I can help it .
 Whether you know that or not , you will stay here as long as I can keep you here .
 Madame Defarge moved toward the door .
 Miss Pross instinctively grabbed her around the waist with both arms and held onto her tightly .
 It was pointless for Madame Defarge to struggle and hit at her .
 Miss Pross held on to her tightly with the strength of love , which is always much stronger than hate .
 She even lifted her up off the floor while they struggled , and Madame Defarge beat and tore at Miss Pross's face with her hands .
 Miss Pross kept her head down and held her around her waist , clinging to her with the force of a drowning woman .
 All of this happened in a second , and there was an awful stillness as the smoke cleared .
 The smoke moved through the air like the soul of Madame Defarge , whose body lied lifeless on the ground .
 Is there any noise in the streets .
 she asked him .
 The usual noises , answered MrCruncher .
 He was surprised by the question and surprised by the way she looked .
 I didn't hear you , said Miss Pross .
 What did you say .
 Is there any noise in the streets now .
 asked Miss Pross again .
 MrCruncher nodded his head again .
 I don't hear it .
 Has she gone deaf in the last hour .
 MrCruncher asked himself , thinking it over , disturbed .
 What's happened to her .
 I feel as if there was a flash and a crash , and that crash was the last thing I'll ever hear in my life , said Miss Pross .
 If she can't hear the rolling of those dreadful carts , which are now very close to their journey's end , said MrCruncher , looking over his shoulder , I think that she will never hear anything else in this world .
 And indeed she never did .
 The empty death carts rumble harshly along the streets of Paris .
 Six carts carry the prisoners who are to be executed that day to the guillotine .
 The guillotine is like all of the devouring , ravenous monsters that have ever been imagined , combined into one .
 And yet even in France , with its rich soil and good weather , there isn't a blade of grass , a leaf , a root , a sprig , or a single peppercorn that will grow to maturity more predictably than the Revolution did .
 If people are beaten down again like this , the same horrible thing will happen .
 If greed and oppression are allowed to grow again , it will produce a similar result .
 Barsad and the other prison spies wait for the tumbrils on the steps of the church .
 He looks into the first tumbril , but he's not there .
 He looks into the second one too , but he's not there .
 He's already wondering , Has he betrayed me .
 Then he looks into the third tumbril and feels relieved as he sees him .
 Which one is Evremonde .
 asks a man behind him .
 That one .
 At the back there .
 Holding the girl's hand .
 Yes .
 The man yells , Down with Evremonde .
 Send all aristocrats to the guillotine .
 Down with Evremonde .
 Hush , hush .
 Barsad says to him timidly .
 And why not , citizen .
 Therese .
 she yells in her shrill voice .
 Has anyone seen her .
 Therese Defarge .
 She's never missed an execution before , says another of the knitting women .
 Yell louder , suggests the other woman .
 The second tumbril empties and moves on .
 The third comes up .
 There is a crash .
 The knitting women , who never stop knitting , count two .
 Or you to me , says Sydney Carton .
 Keep looking at me , dear child , and don't worry about anything else .
 I don't worry about anything while I hold your hand .
 I won't worry about anything when I let it go either , if they kill me quickly .
 They will be quick .
 Don't be afraid .
 What is it .
 What then , my gentle sister .
 It won't seem long , my dear child .
 There is no time in Heaven , and no troubles there .
 You are so comforting to me .
 I am so ignorant .
 Should I kiss you now .
 Is it time .
 Yes .
 It was said in Paris that night that Carton had the most peaceful look on his face that anyone had ever seen on someone sent to the guillotine .
 Many people added that he looked almost heavenly , and like a prophet .
 One of the most remarkable people who died that same day at the guillotine was a woman who had asked at the foot of that same scaffold earlier if she could write down what she was thinking .
 If Carton had said what he had been thinking , and if he had been able to see into the future , he would have said this : 
 I see Barsad , Cly , Defarge , The Vengeance , Jacques Three the juryman , the judge , the many new tyrants that have taken over after destroying the old , all dying at the guillotine , before it stops being used .
 I see the beautiful city of Paris and the wonderful people of France rising up from this abyss , In their struggles to be truly free , in their triumphs and defeats for many years to come , I see the evil of this time , and the evil of the time before that caused the Revolution , gradually making amends for itself and dying out .
 It is a far , far better thing that I do than I have ever done .
 It is a far , far better rest that I go to than I have ever known .
