 The doctor was in the best health and looked especially young . At such times he looked very much like Lucie . As they sat there , side-by-side , she leaning against his shoulder and he resting his arm on the back of her chair , it was very pleasant to see the similarity . He had been talking all day about all sorts of things in an unusually lively way . Say , Dr . Manette , said Mr . Darnay as they sat under the plane tree , have you seen much of the Tower of London ? He said it in regards to the topic they were discussing at the time , which happened to be the old buildings of London . 
 Lucie and I have passed by it , but only casually . We have seen enough of it to know that it's very interesting . That's all . I have been there , as you know , said Darnay , smiling , though his face turned a bit red with anger , in a different way , and not in a way that allows someone to see much of it . They told me something interesting when I was there . What was that ? asked Lucie . Some workmen stumbled upon an old dungeon while they were making renovations . It had been built over and forgotten for many years . 
 On every stone of the inner wall there were inscriptions of dates , names , complaints , and prayers that had been carved by prisoners . On a stone in a corner , one prisoner , who it seems was eventually executed , had carved three letters . They were carved with a dull instrument , and they were done in a hurry with an unsteady hand . At first they read the letters as D . I . C . , but when they looked more carefully the last letter turned out to be a G . There was no record of a prisoner being there with those initials , and no one could guess what the name could have been . After a long time it was suggested that the letters weren't initials , but the word dig . 
 Father ! You're sick ! cried Lucie . Dr . Manette had jumped up suddenly , with his hand to his head . His behavior and look frightened them . No , my dear . I'm not sick . There are large drops of rain falling , and they made me jump . We had better go inside . He recovered almost immediately . Rain really was falling in large drops , and he showed them the rain drops on the back of his hand . But he didn't say a word about the discovery Mr . Darnay had mentioned . As they went into the house , Mr . Lorry's analytical eyes saw , or thought they saw , the same look on the doctor's face , as he turned it toward Charles Darnay , as he had when he had turned toward him in the hallways of the courthouse at the Old Bailey . 
 The look vanished so quickly , however , that Mr . Lorry doubted that he had seen anything at all . The doctor was now steadier than the arm of the golden giant in the hallway . He stopped under it to say that he was still vulnerable to slight surprises (he might always be) , and the rain had surprised him . At teatime , while Miss Pross made tea , she had another twitching fit like she had before , and hundreds of people had still not arrived to visit Miss Manette . Mr . Carton had arrived , but he was only the second person to come by . 
 It was such a hot night that , although they had the doors and windows open , they were overpowered by the heat . When they were done with the tea table , they all moved to one of the windows and looked out into the dusk . Lucie sat by her father , Darnay sat beside her , and Carton leaned against the window . The wind from the thunder gusts blew the long , white curtains up near the ceiling like the ghostly wings . 
 The rain is still falling in large , heavy , sparse drops , said Dr . Manette . The drops come slowly . The storm is on its way , said Carton . They spoke quietly , the way people speak when they are waiting for something , the way people speak in a dark room while waiting to see lightning . People were running through the streets trying to get inside before the storm broke . The street corner was filled with the echoes of footsteps coming and going , even though no one could actually be seen walking there . It sounds like so many people , and yet no one is there ! said Darnay after they had listened for a while . 
 Isn't it impressive , Mr . Darnay ? asked Lucie . Some nights I have sat here until I have imaginedbut even something silly I have imagined makes me shudder tonight , when everything is so dark and seriousLet us shudder too . Tell us what it is . It will seem like nothing to you . Such ideas are only interesting as we make them up , I think . They shouldn't be told to others . I have sometimes sat here alone at night , listening until I have imagined that all of the echoes are the echoes of the footsteps of the people that will soon be coming into our lives . 
 A lot of people will be coming into our lives if that's the case , added Sydney Carton in his moody way . The footsteps never stopped . They sped up more and more , and the corner echoed and re-echoed with their sound . Some seemed to be under the windows , and some seemed to be in the room . Some were coming and some were going . Some of them were breaking off and some stopped altogether . All were in the streets in the distance , and no one was in sight . 
 Are all these people making these footsteps destined to come to all of us here ? Or do we divide them among us ? I don't know , Mr . Darnay . I told you it was my silly imagination , but you asked to hear it . When I've let my mind wander like this , I've been alone , and then I've imagined that they were the footsteps of the people who will come into my life . And my father's life . I'll accept them into my life ! said Carton . I ask no questions and have no conditions . There are a lot of people coming toward us , Miss Manetteand I can see them by the lightning . He added the last words just after a bright flash of lightning , which illuminated him as he lounged in the window . 
 And I hear them ! he added , after a roar of thunder . Here they come , fast , fierce , and furious ! He was talking about the rush and roar of rain , and he stopped talking because he couldn't be heard over the rain . A terrific storm of thunder and lightning broke , and the thunder , lightning , and rain did not stop even for an instant until after the moon rose at midnight . The bell at Saint Paul's Cathedral struck one o'clock in the now clear air . Mr . Lorry headed home to Clerkenwell , escorted by Jerry , who wore high boots and carried a lantern . 
 There were lonely parts of the road on the way between Soho and Clerkenwell , and Mr . Lorry worried about thieves and always used Jerry for a ride home , though he usually headed home two hours earlier . What a night it has been ! said Mr . Lorry . Almost a night that would bring the dead out of their graves , Jerry . I've never seen a night that would do that . And I don't expect to , answered Jerry . Good night , Mr . Carton , said Mr . Lorry . Good night , Mr . Darnay . Do you think we'll ever see such a night together again ? They might . They might also see a great roaring crowd of people come rushing at them , too . 
 The monseigneur , one of the great and powerful lords of the court , held a reception every two weeks at his grand hotel in Paris . The monseigneur was in his private room , and the crowd of people in the outer rooms worshipped the monseigneur and treated his private room like a holy sanctuary . The monseigneur was about to have his chocolate . He could swallow anything easilya few unhappy people were even saying that he was quickly swallowing all of Francebut he couldn't eat his morning chocolate without the help of four strong men , as well as the cook . 
 Yes , it took four men . All of them were dressed extravagantly , and the one in charge had two gold watches in his pocket , following the monseigneur's noble and chaste example . One servant carried the pot of chocolate to the monseigneur , the second stirred up the chocolate with a little instrument , a third brought him his napkin , and a fourththe one with two watchespoured out the chocolate . The monseigneur couldn't have gotten rid of one of these servants without losing his admired place in the world .
 He would have brought great shame to his family crest if he had had only three servants . Having only two would have killed him . Monseigneur had been out to dinner the night before , where the Comedy and the Grand Opera had been performed . Monseigneur went out to dinner most nights , and there were always interesting people around . He was so polite and easily swayed that the Comedy and the Grand Opera influenced his opinion on matters of government and state secrets far more than the country's needs did . This wasn't good for France , as it's never good for a country to be ruled by frivolous leaders , like when the merry Stuart King Charles II Stuart ruled England . 
 The monseigneur had one truly noble idea about public business in general : to let everything continue on its own . For specific kinds of public business he had another respectable idea : that it should benefit him personally and give him more power or money . He believed that the world had been created to bring him pleasure . The text of his class , which had only been changed by one pronoun , read , The earth and its fullness are mine , says the monseigneur . 
 However , the monseigneur had slowly discovered that things were not going well in his private and public financial affairs , so he had become close with the tax collector . The monseigneur relied on the tax collector for public financial matters because he didn't understand them and had to rely on someone who could . He relied on him for private finance , because tax collectors were rich , and after many years of living in luxury the monseigneur was running out of money . He had pulled his sister out of a convent before she had become a nun (where she would have worn a veilthe cheapest garment she could wear) . Instead , he made her marry a very rich tax collector whose family was of a lower class . 
 This tax collector , who was appropriately carrying a cane with a golden apple on top , was one of the people in the other room . Most people groveled before the tax collector . All except people of a higher class like the monseigneur , and even his own wife , who looked down on him with contempt . The tax collector was an extravagant man . He had thirty horses in his stables , twenty-four manservants in his house , and six maids served his wife . Though his in-laws looked down on him , the tax collector was the most honest of the people at the monseigneur's hotel that day as he didn't hide the fact that all he did was steal and take what he could . 
 Elegant , well-bred gentlemen , who , then just as now , have been known by their lack of interest in any interesting subject , were in a fine state of exhaustion at the monseigneur's . The spies in the upper-class world of Paris would have had trouble finding one wife in the homes of these men who would admit that she was a mother . 
 The comforting part was that everyone at the monseigneur's hotel was perfectly dressed . If the day of Judgment was a day on which one's clothing were judged , everyone would have been fine for eternity . People frizzled and powdered and stuck their hair up . Their delicate skin was preserved and covered in makeup . The men wore attractive swords , and everyone smelled good . All of this would surely keep anything going forever . The elegant gentlemen of the best breeding wore little decorations that clinked as they strolled around . These golden chains rang like precious little bells . That ringing , and the rustle of silk and expensive cloth , caused a flutter in the air that stirred up the hunger of the poor in Saint Antoine far away . 
 Clothing was the one unfailing charm that kept all things in place . Everyone was dressed for a fancy ball that would never stop , from the people at the palace of the Tuileries , to monseigneur and all of the court , to the judges' chambers and all of society . All , that is , except for the poor . Even the executioner was dressed for the ball . He , according to the style , performed his job dressed up , wearing makeup and a gold-laced coat , high heels , and white silk stockings . At the gallows and the wheel an execution method in which the prisoner's limbs were broken wheel the axe was rarely usedthe executioner wore fancy clothes . He was known as Mr . Paris by Mr . Orleans and his other fellow executioners . 
 And who , at the monseigneur's party in 1780 , could possibly doubt that a system based around a made-up , gold-laced , high-heeled , silk-stocking-wearing hangman wouldn't outlast the stars themselves ! Monseigneur had taken his chocolate from his four servants and eaten it , and he opened the doors of his inner chamber and came out . When he did , everyone started bowing , scraping , fawning , and generally humiliating themselves before him . Everyone did so much bowing and praying for the monseigneur that nothing was left for Heaven , which might have been one of several reason why the monseigneur's worshippers never went there . 
 As the monseigneur walked to the distant outer rooms , reaching the far region of the Circumference of Truth , he talked and smiled to his worshippers , promising something to one person or waving to another . Then he turned , came back , and eventually went back into his room with his servants . He wasn't seen again . After the monseigneur's show was over , the flutter of people and the ringing of their precious little bells faded and went downstairs . Soon there was only one person left in the crowd . He had his hat under his arm and his snuffbox in his hand , and he slowly walked past the mirrors on the wall on the way out . 
 With a loud rattle and clatter , the carriage rushed through the streets and around corners , disregarding the safety of others in a way that's difficult to understand now . Women screamed , and men grabbed each other and pulled children out of the way . Finally , as the carriage swooped around a street corner by a fountain , one of its wheels gave a sickening little bump . Several people cried out , and the horses reared up and halted . 
 If the horses hadn't stopped , the carriage probably would have kept going . Carriages often drove on and left behind whomever they had hurt . And why not ? But the frightened driver had gotten down quickly off the top of the coach , and ten people held the horses' bridles . What's wrong ? said the man inside . He calmly looked out of the carriage . A tall man wearing a nightcap had picked up a bundle from under the horses' feet and laid it on the base of the fountain . He was kneeling down in the wet mud , howling and crying like a wild animal . 
 Excuse me , monsieur the marquis ! said a meek man in ragged clothing . It is a child . Why is he howling like that ? Is it his child ? Excuse me , monsieur the marquis . It's a shame , but yes , it is . The fountain was a little set off from the street , for the street opened into a space of about ten or twelve square yards . The tall man suddenly got up from the ground and ran toward the carriage . Monsieur the marquis reached for the handle of his sword . He's been killed ! screamed the man , extending both arms over his head desperately . He's dead ! 
 The crowd gathered around and looked at monsieur the marquis . They only looked at him carefully and eagerly , without any menace or anger . No one said anything . After the first cry they had all stayed completely silent . The voice of the meek man was flat and tame with submission . The marquis looked at them all as if they were rats that had just come out of their holes . 
 The marquis took out his purse . I'm amazed that you people can't take care of yourselves and your children . One or another of you is always getting in the way . Who knows how badly you've hurt my horses ? Here ! Give him that . He tossed a gold coin on the ground for the driver to pick up , and everyone leaned forward to watch it as it fell . The tall man cried out again desperately , He's dead ! 
 Another man , for whom everyone else made way , arrived quickly and stopped him . On seeing this late comer , the meek man fell onto his shoulder , sobbing and crying and pointing to the fountain where some women were bent over the motionless bundle . They moved around it gently , completely silent , as were the men . I know , I know , said the man who had just arrived . Be brave , Gaspard ! It is better for the poor child to die this way than to live . It has died in an instant without suffering . Could it have lived one hour as happily ? 
 You are a philosopher , said the marquis , smiling . What is your name ? My name is Defarge . What is your job ? I sell wine , monsieur the marquis . Pick that up , you philosopher and seller of wine , said the marquis , throwing down another gold coin . Spend it however you like . Are the horses all right ? Without bothering to look at the crowd again , monsieur the marquis leaned back in his chair . As the carriage drove away the marquis had the look of a gentleman who has accidentally broken some small trifle and paid for it easily . His ease was disturbed when a coin flew into the carriage and landed on the floor . 
 Stop ! said monsieur the marquis . Stop the horses ! Who threw that ? He looked to where Defarge the wine seller had been standing a moment before . But instead he saw the poor father facedown on the pavement , crying there . The only person who stood beside him was a large , dark woman who was knitting . You dogs ! said the marquis smoothly , his face unchanged except for the corners of his nose . I would happily run any of you over and eliminate you like you were insects or vermin . If I knew which one of you rascals threw that coin into the carriage , and if that person was nearby , I would crush him under the wheels . 
 The people were so used to being subservient , and had so much bad experience that they knew what a man like the marquis could do to them , legally or otherwise , that no one said or did anything . None of the men even raised an eye . Only the woman who stood there knitting looked up steadily , and looked the marquis in the face . He was too dignified to even notice . His hate-filled eyes passed over her , and over the whole crowd of vermin . He leaned back in his seat again and yelled to the driver , Go on ! 
 The carriage drove on , and other carriages came speeding by after it . Ministers , state projectors , tax collectors , doctors , lawyers , churchmen , people from the Grand Opera and the Comedyall the people who had been at the monseigneur's dinnercame whirling by . The poorer people came creeping out of their homes to look at the accident . They stayed there for hours . Soldiers and policemen came between the people and the accident and formed a barrier that they slunk behind and peeped through . 
 The father had picked up his dead child and gone off with it long ago . The women who had cared for the child while it was lying at the base of the fountain sat there watching the water flowing in the fountain and the rich people drive by . All this time the one woman who was knitting stayed there , knitting as steadily as fate In Greek myth , one of the Fates spun a thread that represented each person's destiny fate . Soon everything was back to normal : The water ran in the fountain . The swift river ran . The day ran into evening . The life in the streets ran on quietly as it always does . The poor went back to sleeping in their cramped little homes . The rich people went to their fancy dinners , and all things ran their course . 
 The landscape was beautiful . The corn had a bright color , though there wasn't very much of it . Little patches of rye grew where corn should have been . Little patches of small peas and beans also grew there , and so did little patches of most of the cheap vegetables that can be used as substitutes for wheat . The plants , like the men and women who grew them , looked like they were growing unwillingly , like they wanted to give up and die . 
 Monsieur the marquis rode in his traveling carriage , which was loaded with unnecessary things . The carriage was conducted by four horses and two guards on horseback , all struggling up a steep hill . The marquis's face was blushing red , but not because he wasn't of good breeding . The redness didn't come from within but from an external source beyond his control : the sunset . The light from the sunset shone so strongly into the traveling carriage when it reached the top of the hill that the marquis was covered in a crimson light . The light will die out soon , said the marquis as he glanced at his hands . 
 The sun was so low that it set right at that moment . When they adjusted the brakes of the wheel , the carriage slid downhill . With the smell of fire , the red glow disappeared in a cloud of dust . The sun went down as the marquis went down the hill , and there was no glow left when they took the brake off the wheel . But the impoverished countryside was still there . A little village sat at the bottom of the hill . There was a church tower , a windmill , a forest for hunting , and a cliff with a castle on it that was used as a prison . All of these were growing darker as night came on . The marquis looked around at all these objects like someone who was returning home . 
 The village had one poor street with its one poor brewery , a poor tannery , a poor tavern , a poor stable yard for exchanging horses that delivered the mail , a poor fountain , and all the usual poor parts of a village . There were poor people there too . Everyone who lived in the village was poor , and many of them were sitting in their doorways shredding a few onions and other bits of food for supper . Many were at the fountain washing off leaves , grass , and anything from the ground that was edible . Small signs of their poverty were everywhere . They were taxed by the state , by the church , and by the lord . They paid both the local tax collector and the general tax collector , according to tradition . It was amazing there was any village left at all . 
 The marquis's arrival was announced by a messenger who had come ahead of him and by the sound of the horseman cracking his whip , which wrapped around the horses' heads like a snake in the night air . The marquis's traveling carriage pulled up in front of the posting-house gate . It was near the fountain , and the peasants stopped what they were doing to look at him . He looked back at them , and , although he didn't notice it , the peasants were all slowly and surely wasting away , this wasting being the reason that people in England would think of Frenchmen as small and thin for the next hundred years or so . 
 The marquis glanced over the faces of the peasants , and they bowed their heads before him the same way he had bowed his head in front of the monseigneur . The only difference was that these people were bowing because they were suffering , not because they wanted to appease him . Just then a gray old repairer of roads joined the crowd . Bring that man over to me ! said the marquis to the messenger . The man was brought to him . He had taken off his hat and held it in his hand , and the other men crowded around him to look and listen the way the people had at the fountain in Paris . 
 Did I pass you on the road ? Yes , Monseigneur . I had the honor of seeing you on the road . I saw you coming up the hill . And at the top of the hill ? It's true , Monseigneur . What were you looking at so intently ? Monseigneur , I was looking at the man . He bent down a little , and with his tattered blue cap he pointed under the carriage . Everyone around him bent over to look under the carriage . What man , you pig ? Why were you looking there ? Excuse me , Monseigneur , he was hanging onto the chain of the brake . Who ? asked the monseigneur . The man , Monseigneur . 
 Curse these idiots ! What was the man's name ? You know all the men in this part of the country . Who was he ? Have mercy on me , Monseigneur ! He was not from this part of the country . I'd never seen him before in my life . He was hanging onto the chain ? Was he trying to suffocate himself ? That was what was amazing about it , Monseigneur . If you'll permit me . His head was hanging overlike this ! He turned himself sideways to the carriage and leaned back . He faced up and his head was hanging down . Then he got back up , fumbled with his cap , and bowed . 
 What was the man like ? He was whiter than a miller , Monseigneur . He was covered in dust and white as a ghost . Tall as a ghost too ! The description produced an immense reaction in the crowd , but everyone kept looking at the marquis . They might have been looking to see if he had any ghosts on his conscience . Really , you did well to see a thief traveling under my carriage and not say anything , said the marquis sarcastically , aware that he shouldn't let poor people bother him . Bah ! Hold him , Monsieur Gabelle ! 
 Monsieur Gabelle was the postmaster and also a tax official . He had eagerly come out to help with the interrogation . He held the man being examined by his sleeve officially . Bah ! Go aside ! said Monsieur Gabelle . Arrest this stranger if he tries to stay in your village tonight . And make sure that his business is honest , Gabelle . I am happy to be of service , Monseigneur . 
 Did he run away , fellow ? Where did that accursed man go ? The accursed man was already under the carriage with six or so of his friends , pointing out the chain with his blue cap . Some six or so other people quickly pulled him out from under the carriage and brought him to the marquis . He was out of breath . Did the man run away , you dolt , when we stopped to apply the brake ? Monseigneur , he jumped over the side of the hill , headfirst , the way a person jumps into a river . Look into it , Gabelle . Then he yelled to the driver , Let's go ! 
 The six or so people who had been looking at the chain were still near the wheels . The wheels turned so quickly that they were lucky to get out of the way and to save their skin and bones . They were all very skinny , and there wasn't much else left of them , otherwise they might not have been so lucky . The carriage burst out of the village and headed toward a rise in the road . The hill was steep , though , and soon the carriage had slowed down to a walking pace . It swung and lumbered up the hill among the sweet scents of the summer night . The horsemen were surrounded by thousands of tiny gnats , and they lashed the horses with their whips . The valet walked beside the horses . The courier could be heard as he trotted ahead into the distance . 
 At the steepest part of the hill there was a little graveyard with a cross and a large figure of Jesus Christ on it . It was a rough wooden figure done by some amateur country sculptor . He must have based the figure on a person he knew , or perhaps on himself , for it was terribly small and thin . A woman was kneeling at the foot of this figure . She turned her head as the carriage came near her and quickly got up and went to stand at the carriage door . 
 It's you , Monseigneur ! I have a petition for you . He exclaimed impatiently but looked out at her . His expression didn't change . What ? What is it ? Always petitions ! Monseigneur , for the love of God ! My husband the foresterÖWhat about your husband the forester ? It's always the same with you people . He can't afford to pay for something ? He has paid all that he has , Monseigneur . He is dead . Good ! He's quiet . Can I bring him back to life for you ? Sadly , no , Monseigneur . But he is buried over there under a sad little heap of grass . 
 So ? Monseigneur , there are so many sad little heaps of grassÖAgain , so ? She looked like an old woman , but she was in fact young . She wrung her vein-covered , rough hands together with wild energy and placed one of them on the door of the carriage . She did it tenderly as if placing her hand on someone's chest , as if the carriage could feel her touch . Listen to me , Monseigneur . Listen to my petition ! My husband died of hunger . So many people do . So many more people will die from hunger . 
 Again , so ? Can I feed them all ? God knows that I'm not asking for that , Monseigneur . My petition is that a small bit of stone or wood with my husband's name be used to mark his grave . Otherwise his burial place will soon be forgotten . No one will find it after I die of hunger too . I will be buried under a different sad little heap of grass , Monseigneur . There are so many unmarked graves . People are dying faster and faster . There is so much hunger , Monseigneur . Monseigneur ! 
 The summer air was sweet all around him , and the same air surrounded the dusty , ragged , worn-out group of peasants at the fountain close by . The repairer of roads with the blue cap was still telling the story of the man under the carriage . As the crowd grew tired of the story , they walked away one by one . Lights started to shine in the little windows of the village , and the lights in the windows went out and more stars appeared . It looked as if the lights in the windows hadn't been put out but had shot up into the sky .
 The marquis's chateau was a massive , solid building . It had a large stone courtyard in front of it , and two stone staircases on either side led up to a stone terrace in front of the main door . The whole thing was made of stone . It had heavy stone railings and large stone flowerpots with stone flowers in them . There were men's faces and lion's heads carved out of stone decorating the building everywhere . It was as if a Gorgon a woman in Greek mythology with snakes for hair who turned people who looked at her into stone Gorgon had looked at the chateau when it had been built two hundred years ago and turned it all to stone . 
 The marquis got out of his carriage and went up the wide flight of short steps , and servants with torches went before him . The light cut through the darkness , causing an owl to hoot in the roof of a large stable that was off through the trees . Otherwise it was so quiet that the torches the servants carried on the steps and held at the front door sounded as if they were burning in a small stateroom instead of in the open night air . There was no other sound besides the hooting of the owl and the sound of water in a fountain falling into its stone basin . It was as if the night were holding its breath , sighing a long , low breath , and then holding its breath again . 
 The marquis avoided the larger rooms , which were dark and had been locked for the night . With his torchbearer going in front of him , he went up a staircase to a door in a hallway . The door led him to his own private three-room apartment , consisting of a bedroom and two other rooms . The rooms had high , vaulted ceilings and cold , bare floors . There were large dogs on the hearth where they would burn wood in the fireplace during the winter . The rooms had all the luxuries befitting a marquis at this luxurious time and place in history . The style of one of the last kings , Louis XIV of Francepart of a line of kings that thought for sure they would rule foreverwas known for its elegant furniture . But there were also many objects that referred to different periods in the history of France . 
 In the third room the servants set the dinner table for two . The room was round and was in one of the house's four towers , the tops of which looked like candle extinguishers . It was a small room , high up in the chateau . The window was wide open and the wooden shutters were closed . The darkness shone through the slats of the shutters and made dark horizontal lines on the stone floor . The marquis looked at the table settings . Is that for my nephew ? The servants said he hadn't arrived yet . He had not arrived , but he was expected . 
 Ah ! He probably won't arrive tonight . But leave the table as it is anyway . I will be ready for dinner in fifteen minutes . The monseigneur was ready for dinner in fifteen minutes , and he sat down alone to his extravagant dinner . His chair was on the opposite side from the window , and he was eating his soup . He was about to take a sip from a glass of Bordeaux wine when he suddenly put it down . What is that ? he asked calmly , looking at the horizontal lines of black on the stone floor . 
 What , Monseigneur ? That ? Outside the blinds . Open the blinds . The servant opened the blinds . Well ? It's nothing , Monseigneur . There's nothing outside but the trees and the darkness . The servant who had spoken had opened the blinds wide and had looked out into the empty night . He stood at the window with the darkness behind him , looking to the marquis for further instructions . Good , said the marquis calmly . Close the blinds again . The servant closed the blinds and the marquis went back to eating his supper . He had finished half of it when he stopped eating again with his glass of wine in his hands . He had heard the sound of wheels , and the sound grew closer and quickly came up to the front of the house . 
 Find out who has arrived . It was the monseigneur's nephew . He had been a few leagues a league is about three miles leagues behind the monseigneur early in the afternoon . He had been catching up to him quickly , but not quickly enough to arrive with him at the house . At the posting house he had been told that the monseigneur was ahead of him . The servants told the nephew that supper was waiting for him and that the monseigneur wanted him to join him . He came to supper shortly after he arrived . In England , the monseigneur's nephew was known as Charles Darnay . 
 The monseigneur was polite when he arrived , but they did not shake hands . You left Paris yesterday , sir ? he asked the monseigneur as he sat down at the table . Yes , yesterday . And you ? I came here directly . From London ? Yes . It took you a long time to get here , said the marquis , smiling . No . I came directly . Excuse me ! I didn't mean a long time in your journey . I meant a long time intending to come here . I have been delayed by the nephew paused various business . Without a doubt , said the marquis calmly . 
 While the servants were there , the two men did not speak . After coffee had been served and they were alone , the nephew looked at his uncle . He looked in his eyeshis uncle's face was like a fine maskand started up a conversation . As you guess , I have come back , sir , looking for the object that took me away in the first place . It put me in great and unexpected danger . But it is a sacred object , and even if it had led to my death , I hope it would have protected me . Don't say ëto death , ' said the uncle . It's not necessary to say ëto death . '
 I doubt , sir , that if it had carried me to the very brink of death , you would have stopped me there , answered the nephew . The expression on the marquis's face , and the dents in his nose , ominously suggested that was true . The uncle made a graceful gesture of protest , but it was so apparent that he was only being polite that it wasn't very reassuring . Indeed , sir , as far as I know , you may have arranged to make my already suspicious circumstances look even more suspicious . 
 No , no , no , said the uncle , pleasantly . But whether that's true or not , continued the nephew , looking at him suspiciously , I know that you would stop me any way you could , and use any means necessary . My friend , I told you that myself , said the uncle . The two dents in his nose pulsed quietly . Do me the favor of remembering that I told you that a long time ago . I remember that . Thank you , said the marquis , very sweetly . The tone of his voice stayed in the air like the tone of a musical instrument . 
 In effect , sir , continued the nephew . I believe that it is both your bad luck and my good luck that I am not in a prison in France right now . I don't quite understand , answered the uncle , sipping his coffee . Can you explain ? I believe that if you weren't out of favor with the court , and had not been for years , that a letter de cachet official documents that could be used to send someone to prison letter de cachet would have put me in prison indefinitely . It is possible that , for the sake of our family's honor , I might even decide to inconvenience you to that extent , said the uncle calmly . Please excuse me ! I see that , luckily for me , you were received coldly two days ago at the monseigneur's reception , as usual , said the nephew . 
 I wouldn't say luckily , my friend , answered the uncle politely . I would not be so sure of that . Some time alone in a prison cell to think things over might have a better influence on your future than you have on it yourself . But it is useless to talk about this . I am , as you have said , at a disadvantage . These little things we dosending people to prison , helping the power and honor of familiesthese slight advantages that might inconvenience you are only to be gotten by being insistent . 
 So many people want them , and so few get them ! It didn't used to be like this , but France has changed for the worse in such ways . Our ancestors , not long ago , held the right of life or death over the peasants and the poor . Many such dogs have been dragged out of this very room and hanged . In my bedroom next door , one man , as far as we know , was stabbed with a poniard a small dagger poniard for saying disrespectful things about his daughter . His own daughter ! We have lost many of our privileges . There is a new way of thinking today . And the power of our position , these days , mightI won't say that it definitely would , but it mightcause us real inconvenience . All of this is very bad for us ! 
 The marquis inhaled a pinch of snuff powdered tobacco that is sniffed up the nostrils snuff and shook his head . He was as elegantly unhappy as he could be with a country where he and his family still lived . We have used the power of our family's position , both in the old days and today , to such a degree , said Darnay unhappily , that I think our name is more hated that any name in France . Let's hope so , said the uncle . Hatred of the upper classes is the involuntary respect of the low classes . 
 There isn't a person anywhere in this country who looks at me with respect . They look at me with the fear and submission of slavery . That is a compliment to the magnificence of our family , earned by living a magnificent lifestyle . Hah ! The marquis laughed and inhaled another pinch of snuff . He crossed his legs daintily . The nephew leaned his elbow on the table and covered his face with his hands . The marquis glared at him sideways with a look of sharpness , familiarity , and dislike . The expression didn't match the attitude of indifference he pretended to have . 
 The only philosophy left is oppression ! The dark respect of fear and slavery , my friend , will keep the peasants in line as long as this roof blocks out the sky , he said , looking up at the ceiling . That might not be as long as the marquis thought . If someone had shown him a picture of his chateau a few years later , and a picture of fifty others like it , he might not have been able to tell his house from the other burned , destroyed wrecks . As far as the roof , he might have discovered it blocking out the sky in a new awayshutting it out from the sight of the people who were shot by the bullets of a hundred thousand muskets . 
 Meanwhile , said the marquis , I will preserve the honor and faith of our family , if you won't . But you must be tired . Should we end our meeting for the night ? One more minute . We can continue for another hour if you want . Sir , said the nephew , we have done wrong , and we are reaping the benefits of these wrongdoings . We have done wrong ? the marquis repeated with a questioning smile , delicately pointing at his nephew and then to himself . 
 Our family . Our honorable family , whose reputation is so very important to both of us , but in such different ways . Even during my father's generation , our family did many wrongs . We hurt every person who came between us and our pleasure , whatever it was . Why am I talking about my father's time when it is also your time ? You are my father's twin brother . You inherited as much as he did and succeeded as head of this family after he died . How can I separate you from him ? Death has separated us ! said the marquis . 
 And death has left me tied to a system that is dreadful to me . I am responsible for it but am also powerless in it . I am trying to following through on my mother's dying request and the look her in eyes , which begged me to have mercy and to make up for past wrongs . I am also tortured by looking for help and power and finding none . If you are looking for help from me , nephew , you will never find it , said the marquis . He touched Darnay's chest with his finger . They were now standing by the fireplace . 
 Every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face was mean and tight . He stood there , looking quietly at his nephew , with his snuffbox in his hand . He touched his nephew's chest with his finger again , as though his finger were the tip of a small sword that he delicately ran through his nephew's chest . He said , My friend , I will die preserving the system under which I have lived . 
 When he said it , he inhaled a pinch of snuff and put the snuffbox in his pocket . Better to be a rational creature , he added after ringing a small bell on the table , and accept your natural destiny . But I can see that you are lost , Monsieur Charles . Our family's property and all of this country are lost to me , said the nephew , sadly . I am giving them up . Are they both yours to give up ? France may be , but is our family's property ? It's hardly worth mentioning because it is so little , but is it yours yet ? I have no plan to claim it yet . If I inherited it from you tomorrow
 Which I hope , for my sake , is not likely , the marquis said . Or twenty years from nowYou're too kind , said the marquis . Still , I prefer the possibility that I may live that long . I would give it up and go live a different kind of life somewhere else . It isn't much to give up . It only brings me misery . Hah ! said the marquis , looking around his finely decorated room . The room is nice-looking enough . But to see it for what it really is , under the sky by daylight , it is a crumbling tower of wastefulness . It is poorly managed , and we are in debt . We have built our fortune on the oppression , starvation , and mistreatment of others . 
 Hah ! said the marquis again , in a well-satisfied manner . If I ever inherit it , it will be given to someone who is more qualified to put it back into good condition . This way , the poor peasants who are tied to this land and who have been abused for so long may , in another generation , suffer less . But I don't want it . There is a curse on this house and all of this land . 
 What about you ? asked the uncle . Forgive my curiosity , but with your new ideas , how do you plan on making a living ? I will do what other people here in France do , and what the nobility may someday have to do . I will work . In England , perhaps ? Yes . I will not tarnish the family name there . The family name can't harm me elsewhere , since I do not use it in other countries . When the marquis had rung the bell , his valet lit the bedroom next door . Bright light now shone from it through the doorway . The marquis looked that way and listened until he had heard his valet walk away . 
 You like England a lot . You have done well for yourself there , he said , smiling calmly at his nephew . I have told you already that I may be indebted to you , sir , for my success there . Otherwise , it has been a safe haven for me . Those bragging English say that it is a safe haven for many people . Do you know another Frenchman who has also found safety there ? A doctor ? Yes . With a daughter ? Yes . Yes , said the marquis . You are tired . Good night ! 
 As the marquis smiled and bowed , there was something suspicious in his face , and there was something mysterious about his last words . The nephew noticed this , and it bothered him . At the same time , the thin lines around the marquis's eyes , lips , and nose made his expression look handsome and evil . Yes , repeated the marquis . A doctor with a daughter . Yes . So begins the new way of thinking . You are tired . Good night ! 
 It would have been as useful to question the stone faces outside the chateau as it was to question the marquis's face . The nephew looked at him as he passed him on his way out the door , but he couldn't tell what he was thinking . Good night ! said the uncle . I look forward to seeing you again in the morning . Sleep well ! He called to the servants : Bring a torch and show my nephew to his room ! Then he muttered to himself , And burn him to death in his bed , if you will . He rang the little bell again and called his valet to his own bedroom . 
 After the valet had come and gone , the marquis paced back and forth in his loose robe to prepare himself for sleep on that hot , still night . He was wearing soft slippers on his feet and he moved around the room like an elegant tiger , making no noise at all . He looked like some magical marquis in a story who could change into a tiger , and was either just about to become a tiger or change back from a tiger into a man . 
 He walked from one end of his elegant bedroom to the other , thinking about what had happened to him that day . He thought of the carriage slowly climbing up the hill at sunset . He thought of the sun setting and the carriage traveling down the hill , of the mill , the prison on the rock , the little village in the valley , the peasants at the fountain , and the repairer of roads with his blue hat pointing out the chain under the carriage . The fountain reminded him of the fountain in Paris , and he though of the bundled-up child lying on the step , the women bending over it , and the tall man waving his arms in the air and yelling , Dead ! 
 I am cooler now and am ready to go to bed , said the marquis . He left only one candle burning on the hearth , and he pulled the thin gauze curtains around the bed . He heard the sound of the wind outside in the night as he settled down to sleep . The stone faces on the chateau's outer walls looked out at the night . It was quiet and dark for three long hours . For three long hours , the horses rattled in their stables , the dogs barked , and the owl made a noise that sounded very different from the sound poets say they make . But animals are often stubborn and don't often say the lines written for them . 
 For three hours , the stone faces of men and lions on the chateau stared out at the night . All of the land was dark , and the dust settled on the quiet roads . It was so dark that the little heaps of poor grass in the graveyard were indistinguishable from one another , and the figure on the crucifix might have come down , since it was practically invisible in the darkness . In the village , the tax collectors and the people who paid the taxes were fast asleep . They may have been dreaming of large feasts , as starving people usually do , or of resting and living easily , as overworked slaves and oxen do . The thin villagers slept soundly and , in their dreams , were fed well and were free . 
 It got lighter and lighter until sunlight hit the tops of the trees and light spread over the hill . In the sunlight , the water in the chateau fountain looked red as if the water were blood , and the faces of the stone statues were also red . The birds sang loudly , and one little bird sitting on the windowsill of the marquis's bedroom sang with all its might . The closest stone face nearest seemed to stare at the bird . Its mouth was open wide , making it appear amazed and awe stricken . 
 Finally the sun was up and people began to stir in the village . Windows were opened , doors were unlocked , and people came outside shivering , chilled by the sweet morning air . Then they began the hard work that would continue for all of them throughout the day . Some went to the fountain , and some went to work in the fields . Men and women went to dig and search for food . They went to tend to the meager livestock and to lead the skinny cows to any meager pastures they could find near the roadside . A couple of people were at the church kneeling and praying at the cross . A cow they had led there tried to eat the weeds at its feet . 
 The people at the marquis's chateau woke up later than the villagers , as was their habit , but they did gradually awake . First , the boar spears and hunting knives hanging in the hallway gleamed red in the sunlight . Then doors and windows were opened . The horses in their stables turned around to see light and fresh air coming in through the doorways . The iron-grated windows were opened , revealing the leaves outside rustling and sparkling . Dogs pulled at their chains impatiently , impatient to be let loose . 
 What winds told the repairer of roads about this frenzy ? He was already working on the hilltop past the village , with his small lunch lying in a small bundle on a pile of stones . Had the birds , carrying some grains while they flew , dropped the news to him the way they sowed seeds in the ground ? No matter how he knew , that morning the repairer of roads ran as if his life depended on it . He ran down the hill with dust covering his legs to his knees , and didn't stop until he got to the fountain . 
 Everyone from the village was at the fountain . They stood around in their depressed way and whispered quietly , showing no other emotions than morbid curiosity and surprise . The cows that were being led had been brought in and tied to anything that could hold them . They stood there looking on stupidly , or lying down and chewing cud that they had picked up while walking . Some of the people of the chateau , and some from the posting house , and all the tax collectors , carried weapons . They were gathered on the other side of the street not knowing what to do . 
 The repairer of roads had already pushed into a group of fifty friends and was hitting himself on the chest with his blue cap . What did all this mean ? What did it mean that they had lifted Monsieur Gabelle behind a servant on horseback and were carrying him away on the galloping horse , like a new version of the German ballad of Leonora ? It meant that there was one stone face too many up at the chateau . Someone was dead . 
 The Gorgon had looked at the building again that night and had turned one more face to stone . The building had been waiting for this particular stone face for two hundred years . The stone face was that of the marquis on his pillow . It looked like an elegant mask that had been suddenly frightened , made angry , and had then frozen that way . A knife had been plunged into his heart . There was a piece of paper tied to the handle . On it was written : Drive him quickly to his tomb . From Jacques . 
 A year had gone by , and Mr . Charles Darnay was settled in England . He taught the French language and also had knowledge of French literature . Today he would have been a professor , but back then he was a tutor . He taught young men who had the free time and interest to study another language that was spoken all over the world , and he developed a taste for its knowledge and stories . He could also translate them well into English and read them out loud in English . 
 People with such skills were hard to find at that time . Men who were once princes , and supposed to have become kings , hadn't been forced to work as teachers yet . No ruined nobility had gone broke , lost their accounts at Tellson's Bank , and become cooks and carpenters yet . Mr . Darnay soon developed a good reputation as a tutor who made his student's time particularly pleasant and beneficial , and as a graceful translator who brought something to his translations besides what you could find in a dictionary . He knew the situation in France well , and people in England were becoming more and more interested in it . By working tirelessly , he was able to make a good living . 
 He hadn't expected things to be easy for him in London . If he had , he wouldn't have done so well . He had expected hard work , and he found it . He did the work and made the best of it , and by doing this , his success continued . He spent a certain amount of time at Cambridge , where he taught undergraduates . The school tolerated him as he secretly taught European languages , instead of the official Greek and Latin . He spent the rest of his time in London . 
 He had been in love with Lucie Manette since he had been on trial for his life . He had never heard a sound so sweet and king as the sound of her voice . He had never seen anyone more beautiful than she had been when they met , when he was about to be executed . But he hadn't told her that he loved her yet . The murder at the empty chateau , over the water and the long , dusty roads far away , had happened a year ago , and now felt like it was part of a dream . Yet he still hadn't mentioned as much as a single word to her about his feelings . 
 He found the doctor reading in an armchair near the window . The energy that had supported him when he was a prisoner had gradually come back to him , and he was now a very energetic manvery driven and decisive . His energy sometimes came and went quickly , as had happened when he first recovered his other faculties , but this didn't happen too often and was happening less and less frequently . 
 He studied a lot , slept little , handled fatigue easily , and was usually cheerful . Charles Darnay now entered the room and went toward him . The doctor put his book down and held out his hand . Charles Darnay ! I'm happy to see you ! We have been expecting you for three or four days . Mr . Stryver and Sydney Carton were both here yesterday and both said you should have visited by now . I am thankful to them for their interest in me , he answered , a little indifferent about them but very kind to the doctor . Miss Manette
 Is doing well , the doctor continued . And your return will make us all happy . She is out on some household errands , but she will be home soon . Dr . Manette , I knew she wasn't at home . I took the opportunity of her being out to come speak to you . Dr . Manette was silent . Yes ? said the doctor , controlling himself . Bring your chair over here and tell me what it is . Mr . Darnay brought over the chair as he had been told , but he had trouble saying what he wanted to say . 
 I have been lucky , Dr . Manette , to spend the last year and a half enjoying the comfort of your home , he began after a long while . I hope what I'm about to say won'tThe doctor reached out his hand to stop him . After he had kept it there a little while , he drew back his hand and asked : Is Lucie what you want to talk about ? She is . It is hard for me to talk about her at any time . It is especially hard for me to hear you talk about her in that tone , Charles Darnay . It is a tone of great admiration , true respect , and deep love , Dr . Manette ! he said respectfully . 
 The doctor was silent again . Then he replied : I believe you . I trust you . I believe you . He was so restrained and so unwilling to talk about the subject that Charles Darnay hesitated . Shall I continue , sir ? The doctor was silent again . Yes . Continue . You know what I'm about to say . But you can't know how serious I am when I say it , and how much I feel it , without knowing my true thoughts and feelings and my deepest hopes and fears . Dr . Manette , I am in love with your daughter . I am devoted to her and think only of her well-being . If there was ever love in the world , I love her . You have been in love yourself . Think of the love you once had in your life when you think of me ! 
 The doctor sat facing away from him , with his eyes on the ground . After Mr . Darnay had said these last words , Dr . Manette stretched out his hand again quickly and said : Don't speak of that , sir ! Leave that alone ! I beg you , don't bring that up ! It sounded so much like he was actually crying out in pain that Charles Darnay's ears rang long after he had stopped . He gestured with the hand he had reached out toward him . He seemed to be asking Darnay to pause . Mr . Darnay stopped speaking .
