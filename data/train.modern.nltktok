A stern-looking king and a plain-looking queen ruled England .
 A stern-looking king and a beautiful queen ruled France .
 In both countries , it seemed obvious to the people managing the royal food supplies that things were stable and nothing would ever change .
 It was 1775 .
 People in England were as superstitious then as they are now .
 MrsSouthcott a woman who claimed to be a prophet MrsSouthcott had just turned twenty-five , and a private in the British army who claimed he could tell the future announced her appearance by saying that London and Westminster would be destroyed .
 Even the Cock Lane Ghost the ghost of a woman believed to haunt a house on Cock Lane Cock Lane Ghost had only been gone twelve years since last tapping out its messages , as the very unoriginal ghosts of last year tapped out theirs .
 A group of British subjects in the American colonies the First Continental Congress group of British subjects in the American colonies had recently sent messages to the King of England , and oddly enough , these earthly messages proved more important than any of the supernatural ones from Cock Lane .
 With their heads bowed down and their tails shaking , the horses stomped their way through the thick mud , struggling and tripping as if they were coming apart at their joints .
 Whenever the coachman stopped them , yelling Wo-ho .
 the lead horse would violently shake his head , as if he were trying to tell the driver that the coach would never make it .
 Each time the lead horse shook like this , one of the nervous passengers would jump , and feel uneasy .
 A steam-like mist moved gloomily up the hill , like a ghost looking for a place to rest , but finding none .
 The mist was cold and damp , and it moved slowly through the air in ripples that flowed on top of one another like the waves of a rough sea .
 It was so thick that all that could be seen by the light of the coach lamps was the mist itself and a few yards of the road .
 Steam rose off the struggling horses and mixed with the mist , as if the mist were coming from the horses themselves .
 The two other passengers , beside the one already mentioned , were also plodding their way up the hill beside the mail coach .
 All three men were bundled up all the way to their ears and wore high boots .
 They were so covered up that not one of them could say what the others looked like , and all were so secretive that their minds were just as hidden as their faces .
 In those days , travelers kept to themselves , because anyone on the road could be a robber or in league with robbers .
 Every inn and alehouse had someone in it working for thieves , from the landlord down to the lowliest stable boyanyone could be a criminal .
 This is what the guard of the Dover mail coach thought to himself that Friday night in November 1775 , as the mail coach lumbered up Shooter's Hill and the guard stood at his place on the back , stomping his feet and staying close to the chest of weapons .
 In the chest was a loaded blunderbuss an early form of shotgun with a short barrel blunderbuss , six or eight handguns , and a layer of swords at the bottom .
 Hello .
 the guard replied .
 What time do you think it is , Joe .
 Ten minutes past eleven .
 The driver struck the lead horse with his whip , and the horse made a strong push up the hill as the other horses followed .
 The Dover mail coach pushed on once again , with the high boots of the passengers squashing through the mud next to it .
 When the coach stopped , the passengers stopped and stayed close beside it .
 If any of them had been brave enough to suggest they walk ahead into the mist and darkness , one of the others would have suspected him of being a highway robber and shot him .
 What is it , Tom .
 They both listened .
 Sounds like a horse trotting toward us , Joe .
 I'd say that horse is moving faster than that , Tom , replied the guard .
 He let go of the door and jumped back to his place on the coach .
 Gentlemen , in the name of the king , get back in the coach .
 With this hurried command , he cocked the gun , and stood ready to fire .
 It became very quiet once the rumbling and struggling of the mail coach had stopped , adding to the stillness of the night .
 The panting of the horses made the mail coach shake as if it , too , were nervous .
 The passengers' hearts beat so loudly it was as if they could be heard outside their bodies .
 But the quietness reflected the emotions of the passengers , who were out of breath , and holding their breath , their heartbeats speeding up in expectation .
 The sound of a horse running came quickly and furiously up the hill .
 Never mind what it is .
 answered the guard .
 Who are you .
 Is that the Dover mail coach .
 Why do you want to know .
 If it is , I'm looking for one of the passengers .
 Which passenger .
 MrJarvis Lorry .
 Our character said that he was MrJarvis Lorry .
 The guard , the driver , and the two other passengers looked at him distrustfully .
 What's the matter .
 asked the passenger , in a slightly trembling voice .
 Who's looking for me .
 Is it Jerry .
 If that is Jerry , I don't like the sound of his voice , the guard muttered to himself .
 It's scratchier than I'd care for .
 Yes , MrLorry .
 What's the matter .
 The figures of a horse and rider came slowly out of the swirling mist and over to the side of the mail coach , where the passenger was standing .
 The rider bent down , and keeping an eye on the guard , handed the passenger a small folded piece of paper .
 The rider's horse was exhausted , and both the horse and rider were covered in mud , from the hoofs of the horse to the rider's hat .
 Guard .
 said the passenger in a confidential tone .
 There's nothing to worry about .
 I work at Tellson's Bank .
 You must know Tellson's Bank in London .
 I'm going to Paris on business .
 I'll give you money to buy yourself a drink .
 Will you let me read this .
 If you do it quickly , sir .
 He opened it in the light of the coach lamp , and read it to himself first and then aloud : ëWait at Dover for Mademoiselle .
 It's a short message , you see , guard .
 Jerry , tell them my answer was ëBrought back to life .
 Jerry jumped in his saddle .
 That's a very strange answer , he said , raspier than ever .
 Give them that reply and they will know that I understood their message as if I'd written it myself .
 Have a good trip back .
 Good night .
 With that , MrLorry opened the coach door and got in .
 He wasn't helped by the other passengers , who had quietly hidden their watches and purses in their boots and were pretending to be asleep .
 They wanted only to avoid trouble .
 Tom .
 said Joe quietly over the top of the coach .
 Yeah , Joe .
 Did you hear that message .
 I did , Joe .
 What do you think it meant , Tom .
 Nothing , Joe .
 That's a coincidence , Joe said , I thought the same thing myself .
 It's amazing to think that every human being is a complete mystery to every other human being .
 When I enter a big city at night , I think how every one of the houses clustered together in the dark holds its own secret inside .
 and every room in every house has its own secret .
 and every one of the thousands of people in the city keeps a secret from those closest to him .
 In a way it's like death .
 When I am dead I can no longer turn the pages of life's book , and vainly hope to read all of it .
 I won't be able to look at the mysteries of life , and catch glimpses of hidden truths .
 Life ends in an instant , when I've only begun to experience it .
 It ends with its mysteries forever unsolved , leaving me without answers .
 The same is true of my friend , neighbor , or dearest love , all of whom will die .
 Death turns the secrets each individual carries into permanent mysteries , just as my secrets will never come out once I've died .
 Are the dead in London's graveyards more mysterious to me than its living inhabitants are , or am I as much of a mystery to those inhabitants myself .
 The messenger rode slowly back , stopping often at alehouses along the way to drink , but keeping to himself , with his hat angled over his eyes .
 His eyes , which fit him well , were solid black and much too close together , as if each eye feared being caught at something if it were too far from the other .
 They peered out menacingly from under his old hat , which was pulled down low and looked like a three-sided spittoon a receptacle for tobacco chewers to spit into three-sided spittoon .
 And they looked out over the large scarf that covered his chin and throat and went down nearly to his knees .
 When he stopped for a drink , he would remove the scarf with his left hand while he drank with his right , and as soon as he was done , he would cover his face again .
 He was so confused by the message that he kept taking off his hat to scratch his head .
 Except on the very top of his head , which was bald , he had stiff , black hair that stuck up in spikes all over his head and grew almost down to his large , wide nose .
 His hair looked so much like metal spikes that the world's best leapfrog players might have refused to jump over him , thinking it too dangerous .
 The mail coach lumbered , jolted , rattled , and bumped along slowly , with its three passengers inside .
 They must have also seen shapes in the forms as they dozed off and let their thoughts wander .
 Although he thought constantly of the bank , and although he remained vaguely aware that he was still in the coach the way you are only vaguely aware of pain when on a pain-killer , another thought ran through his mind all night .
 He had the feeling that he was on his way to dig someone out of a grave .
 Now , although several faces appeared in front of him in the night , he couldn't determine which was the face of the buried person .
 All the faces belonged to a forty-five-year-old man , but they all differed in the expression they wore , and in how worn-out they looked .
 One facial expression followed another : pride , contempt , defiance , stubbornness , submission , and lamentation .
 Some had sunken cheeks , sickly pale skin , hands and bodies that had wasted away .
 But it was almost always the same face , and every head of hair had gone prematurely white .
 In his dream , MrLorry asked the ghostly figure a hundred times : 
.
 How long had you been buried .
 The answer was always the same : Almost eighteen years .
 Had you given up hope of being dug up .
 Yes , a long time ago .
 Do you know that you've been brought back to life .
 That's what they tell me .
 You want to live , don't you .
 I don't know .
 Should I show her to you .
 Will you come see her .
 The ghostly figured answered this question in different and contradictory ways .
 Sometimes he answered weakly : Wait .
 I would die if I saw her too soon .
 Sometimes he cried tenderly and said , Take me to her .
 Sometimes he became confused and answered , I don't know her .
 I don't understand .
 But even when MrLorry was fully awake , looking at the mist and rain , the light from the lamps , the hedge passing by at the roadside , the shadows outside the coach would blend together with the shadows within .
 The real bank at Temple Bar , the real business of the day before , the real bank vaults , the real message he had received , and the real message he sent back would still be there .
 But the ghostly face would rise up and appear to him again .
 How long have you been buried .
 Almost eighteen years .
 You want to live , don't you .
 I don't know .
 How long had you been buried .
 Almost eighteen years .
 Had you given up all hope of being dug out .
 Yes , a long time ago .
 MrLorry could still hear those words , as clearly as if they had just been spoken in real life , when he woke to realize it was daylight , and the shadows of the night were all gone .
 He opened the window and looked out at the rising sun .
 He saw a field , with a plow sitting where it had been left the night before when the horses were untied from it .
 Further in the distance , he saw a quiet forest , where the bright red and golden yellow leaves remained on the trees .
 Though the ground was cold and wet , the sky was clear and the sun rose , bright , calm , and beautiful .
 Eighteen years .
 said the passenger , looking at the sun .
 Good God .
 Imagine being buried alive for eighteen years .
 When the coach reached Dover late in the morning , the head attendant at the Royal George Hotel opened the coach door .
 He did it with a grand gesture , because a trip from London to Dover during the winter was difficult , and making the journey was an achievement worth congratulating .
 Will there be a mail boat to Calais tomorrow , attendant .
 Yes , sir , if we still have good weather and the wind is decent .
 The tide will be good for setting out at about two in the afternoon , sir .
 Would you like a bed , sir .
 The gentleman in the brown suit was the only person in the coffee room that morning .
 His table was near the fire , and he sat so still as he waited for his food that , with the firelight on him , he looked as though he was having his portrait painted .
 Completing his resemblance to a man having his portrait painted , MrLorry fell asleep .
 The arrival of his breakfast woke him , and he said to the attendant , as he moved his chair up to the table : 
.
 I would like you to get a room ready for a young woman who may arrive here at any time today .
 She may ask for MrJarvis Lorry , or she may just ask for a gentleman from Tellson's Bank .
 Please let me know when she arrives .
 Yes , sir .
 Tellson's Bank in London , sir .
 Yes .
 Yes , sir .
 We often have the honor of hosting you gentlemen as you travel between London and Paris , sir .
 Tellson and Company employees travel a great deal , sir .
 Yes .
 We are very much a French business , as well as an English one .
 Yes , sir .
 You don't frequently do the traveling yourself , do you sir .
 Not in recent years .
 It's been fifteen years since wesince Ilast came back from France .
 Really , sir .
 That was before I worked here , sir .
 Before the new owners bought this place , sir .
 The George Hotel was owned by other people back then , sir .
 I believe it was .
 But I would bet , sir , that a bank like Tellson and Company was thriving fifty , not to mention fifteen , years ago .
 You could triple that and say a hundred and fifty .
 Really , sir .
 MrLorry drank a bottle of good red wine after dinner , causing him to lose interest in work .
 He had been sitting there for a long time and had just poured out his last glassful of winewith as happy an expression as any elderly gentleman can have after drinking most of a bottlewhen he heard the rattling of wheels coming up the street and pulling into the inn's yard .
 He put down his glass without drinking .
 Mademoiselle is here .
 he said .
 In just a few minutes the waiter came in to tell him that Miss Manette had arrived from London and would be happy to see him .
 So soon .
 MrLorry tossed back the rest of his wine with an air of calm desperation , straightened his odd little wig over his ears , and followed the waiter to Miss Manette's room .
 The room was large and dark , and it was furnished like a funeral parlor with black horsehair furniture and heavy , dark tables .
 These tables had been oiled repeatedly , so that the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room were gloomily reflected in the oiled surface .
 The reflections made it look like the candles themselves were buried deep in graves of black mahogany , and they would give off no light until they were dug out .
 I kiss your hand , miss , said MrLorry , in a slightly old-fashioned manner , as he bowed formally again and sat down .
 I received a letter from the bank , sir , yesterday , telling me about some informationor discovery
.
 Ömaking it necessary that I travel to Paris to meet with a gentleman from the bank , who would be sent there to meet with me .
 That's me .
 That's what I thought , sir .
 She curtseyed to him young ladies curtsied in those days to acknowledge how much older and wiser he was than her .
 He bowed to her again .
 I was happy to be given the job , said MrLorry .
 I will be even happier to perform it .
 Of course , said MrLorry .
 After a pause , he adjusted his blond wig around his ears and added , It is very difficult to begin .
 Have we ever met before , sir .
 Would we have .
 MrLorry opened his hands and extended them toward her with an awkward smile .
 If you please , sir .
 Miss Manette , I am a businessman .
 I have a job to do .
 As you listen to me , don't pay any more attention to me than as if I were just a robotreally , I am not much more than that .
 With your permission , miss , I will tell you a story about one of my bank's customers .
 Story .
 Not from Beauvais .
 May I ask , what time this was , sir .
 I'm talking about twenty years ago , miss .
 He married an English lady and I was one of the trustees of their affairs .
 His affairs , like the affairs of many French gentlemen and their families , were entirely in the hands of Tellson's .
 In a similar way , I am , or have been , a trustee of sorts for many of our customers .
 These relationships are entirely business , miss .
 They are not friendships .
 I have moved from one to the next over the course of my work , just as I pass from one customer to the next during my work day .
 In other words , I have no feelings toward these people .
 I am only a machine to continue .
 After this strange description of his work life , MrLorry flattened his blond wig on his head with both hands which was really unnecessary , since it was already as flat as could be and continued .
 So far , miss , as you have said , this is the story you have heard about your poor father .
 This next part is different , though .
 If your father had not died when he didDon't be afraid .
 What a reaction .
 She looked so upset that he lost track of what he was saying , and started over : 
 I beg you to tell me more , sir .
 I will .
 I am going to .
 Can you handle it .
 I can handle anything but the uncertainty you're causing me right now .
 The little child was a daughter , sir .
 For telling me the truth .
 Oh good , kind sir , for telling me the truth .
 Ait's a business matter .
 You're confusing me , and how can I do my job if I'm confused .
 Let's be clear-headed .
 Please tell me now , for instance , how much nine times nine pence is , or how many shillings are in twenty guineas .
 That would make me feel better about your state of mind .
 He felt her grab his wrist tighter and stopped speaking .
 The expression on her forehead , which had so much attracted his attention , had deepened into one of pain and horror .
 A shiver ran through her body and his .
 She said , in a low , clear , awe-struck voice , as if she were in a dream : 
 I am going to see his ghost .
 It will be his ghost , not him .
 MrLorry quietly rubbed her hands , which held his arm .
 There now , there now .
 You know the best and the worst of it now .
 You are well on your way to seeing the poor mistreated gentleman .
 If the journey goes well , you will soon be with him .
 She repeated in the same tone , as low as a whisper , I have been free , I have been happy , but his ghost has never haunted me .
 She sat completely still and silent in her chair , completely shocked .
 Her eyes were open and focused on him , and she still had that expression on her forehead , as if it had been carved or branded there .
 She was holding onto his arm so tightly that he was afraid that if he took it away he would hurt her .
 He stayed still and yelled out for help .
 I think she's actually a man .
 MrLorry thought as he hit the wall .
 Why , look at you all .
 the woman yelled at the inn servants .
 Why don't you go get some things to help her instead of standing there staring at me .
 I am not that pretty , am I .
 Why don't you go get some things to help her .
 I'll teach you a lesson if you don't bring me smelling salts , cold water , and vinegar quickly .
 I hope she'll feel better now , said MrLorry .
 No thanks to you in the bown , if she does , the woman responded .
 My pretty darling .
 I hope you will accompany Miss Manette to France , said MrLorry after another pause of pathetic sympathy and humility .
 Not very likely .
 replied the strong woman .
 If I was supposed to travel overseas , do you suppose Fate would have put me on an island .
 This was another tricky question , and MrJarvis Lorry went away to think about it .
 A large wine cask had been dropped and lay broken in the street .
 The accident happened while people were taking it out of a cart .
 The cask had rolled out quickly , its hoops burst , and it now lay on the stones just outside the door of the wine-shop , shattered like a walnut-shell .
 The red wine had stained the ground where it spilled on the narrow street , in the Paris suburb of Saint Antoine .
 It had stained many hands , faces , bare feet , and wooden shoes , too .
 The hands of the man who sawed wood left red marks on the logs .
 The forehead of the woman who nursed her baby was stained from the old rag she wrapped around her head again .
 Those who had greedily chewed on pieces of the cask now had a tiger-like smear across their mouths .
 One tall prankster wearing a long , filthy nightcap dipped his finger in the mixture of mud and wine and wrote the word blood on a wall .
 The time would come when blood , too , would be spilled on the streets , and many of the people would be stained with it .
 The man pointed proudly to the word he had written , as pranksters often do .
 The joke failed , as pranksters' jokes often do as well .
 What are you doing .
 Are you crazy .
 said the owner of the wine shop , crossing the road and covering the word with a handful of mud .
 Why are you writing this in public .
 Tell me , is there no other place you can write such words .
 While he was talking , he placed his clean hand possibly by accident , possibly not over the prankster's heart .
 The prankster tapped it with his own hand , jumped up quickly , and landed in a strange dancing pose , holding one of his stained shoe in his hand threateningly .
 The prankster was a resourceful man .
 He looked around and saw an old gentleman and a young woman sitting in the corner .
 Other people were in the shop too : two were playing cards , two were playing dominoes , and three were standing by the counter trying to make the most of a small amount of wine .
 As he stepped behind the counter , he noticed the old gentleman give a look to the young woman as if to say , This is the man we're looking for .
 What the devil are you doing here .
 Monsieur Defarge thought .
 I don't know you .
 He pretended not to notice the two strangers and went to talk with the three customers drinking at the counter .
 How's it going , Jacques .
 said one of the three to Monsieur Defarge .
 Has all the spilled wine been drunk .
 Every drop , Jacques , answered Monsieur Defarge .
 After this greeting by first names , Madame Defarge , while picking her teeth with her toothpick , cleared her throat again and raised her eyebrows a bit higher .
 It is not often , the second man said to Monsieur Defarge , that these pathetic creatures get to taste wine , or anything besides black bread and death .
 Don't you agree , Jacques .
 That's true , Jacques , Monsieur Defarge returned .
 After this second exchange of first names , Madame Defarge , still calmly picking her teeth , cleared her throat again and raised her eyebrows a bit higher .
 Ah .
 That's even worse .
 These poor animals always have a sour taste in their mouths , and their lives are hard , Jacques .
 Am I right , Jacques .
 You are right , Jacques , answered Monsieur Defarge .
 They completed this third exchange of first names just as Madame Defarge put down her toothpick and shifted slightly in her seat , with her eyebrows still up .
 The three customers took off their hats and gestured grandly to Madame Defarge .
 She acknowledged their respect by bowing her head and giving them a quick look .
 Then she looked casually around the wine shop and calmly went back to her knitting .
 Good day , gentlemen , said her husband , who had been watching her carefully .
 The apartment you had asked about while I was out is on the fifth floor .
 The doorway of the staircase opens out onto a little courtyard close to the left here , near the window of my shop , he said , pointing with his hand .
 But now I remember that one of you has been there before and can lead way .
 Goodbye , gentlemen .
 They paid for the wine and left .
 Monsieur Defarge was watching his wife knit when the old gentleman came over and asked to speak with him .
 Of course , sir , Monsieur Defarge said and walked quietly with him to the door .
 Their conversation was short but to the point .
 Almost at the first word , Monsieur Defarge jumped to attention .
 Moments later , he nodded and went out .
 The gentleman motioned to the young lady , and they also went out .
 Madame Defarge kept knitting and pretended not to notice .
 MrJarvis Lorry and Miss Manette came out of the wine shop and joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway he had just directed the three customers to .
 It opened onto a dark , stinking little courtyard that served as the public entrance to many houses , where a great number of people lived .
 In the gloomy tiled entry to the gloomy tiled staircase , Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee in front of the child of his old master and kissed her hand .
 Though the gesture was kind , he didn't do it kindly .
 In just a few seconds , he had changed .
 His face was no longer pleasant or friendly , but had become secretive , angry , and dangerous .
 Is he alone .
 MrLorry whispered .
 Alone .
 God help him , who would be with him .
 said Monsieur Defarge , in the same quiet voice .
 Is he always alone .
 Yes .
 By his own choice .
 He needs to be .
 He's been the same since I first saw himsince they found me and asked if I would take care of him in secret .
 Has he changed much .
 Changed .
 Monsieur Defarge stopped to hit the wall with his hand , and he cursed .
 No direct answer could have been half as effective .
 MrLorry's mood grew grimmer as he and the two others climbed the stairs .
 An old staircase like this one , located in the older and more crowded parts of Paris , would be bad enough today 1859 today .
 But back then they were particularly disgusting , especially to people who weren't used to them .
 Every little apartment in one of these large buildings that opened onto the public staircase dumped its garbage on the landing .
 Other refuse got thrown out the windows .
 This unmanageable and hopeless pile of rotting garbage would have polluted the air even if it had not been the garbage of the poor , but the combination of trash and poverty made the smell almost unbearable .
 The three people walked through all this filth and up a steep , dark , dirty stairwell .
 Giving in to his own troubled thoughts and to Miss Manette's anxiety , which became greater every moment , MrJarvis Lorry stopped twice to rest .
 Each stop was made near a miserable air vent , through which any clean air that was left seemed to escape , and through which rotten air seemed to enter .
 Through the air vents you could taste , rather than see , parts of the neighborhood .
 Nothing nearby , from that spot to the great towers of Notre Dame , showed any signs of good health or good thoughts .
 Then the door is locked , my friend .
 asked MrLorry , surprised .
 You think it's necessary to keep the poor gentleman locked up .
 Why .
 Because he has been locked up for so long that he would be afraid , go mad , tear himself apart , die , or some other terrible thing if his door were left open .
 Is that possible .
 exclaimed MrLorry .
 Be brave , miss .
 Courage .
 This is business .
 The worst part will be over in a moment .
 It's just walking into a room , and the worst is over .
 Then , all the goodness , all the relief , all the happiness you'll bring him will begin .
 Let our good friend here help you .
 Our good friend Monsieur Defarge .
 Come , now .
 Business , business .
 I forgot about them when your visit surprised me , explained Monsieur Defarge .
 Go away , my friends .
 we have business here .
 The three men slipped past and went silently downstairs .
 Since there didn't appear to be any other doors on that floor , and the wine-shop owner went straight to this one when they were alone , MrLorry asked him in a whisper , a little angry : 
.
 Are you making a spectacle of Monsieur Manette .
 I show him , in the way you just saw , to a select few .
 Is that proper .
 I think it's proper .
 Who are the few .
 How do you select them .
 He motioned for them to stay back , then leaned over and looked in through the crack in the wall .
 Soon he raised his head and knocked two or three times on the doorapparently just to make noise .
 For this same reason , he dragged the key across the door three or four times before clumsily putting it in the lock and loudly turning it .
 He slowly opened the door slowly , looked into the room , and said something .
 A quiet voice answered back .
 Neither person spoke much more than a syllable .
 A-a-a-business , business .
 he said , with a tear on his cheek that had nothing to do with business .
 Come in .
 I'm afraid of it , she answered , trembling .
 Of it' .
 Of what .
 I mean of him .
 Of my father .
 Concerned by the state she was in and by the gesturing of Monsieur Defarge , MrLorry pulled her arm around his neck , lifted her slightly , and rushed her into the room .
 He sat her down just inside the door and held her as she clung to him .
 Defarge took out the key , closed the door , and locked it from the inside .
 Then he took the key and held it in his hand .
 He did all of this methodically , making as much noise as he could .
 Finally he crossed the room to the window , where he stopped and turned around .
 Good day .
 said Monsieur Defarge to the white-haired man , who was bent over making shoes .
 The man looked up for a moment and answered quietly , as if he were far away : 
 Good day .
 You are still hard at work , I see .
 His voice was so quiet it was pitiful and dreadful .
 It wasn't quiet because the man was physically weak , although being locked up and treated badly had done their part .
 His voice was quiet because he had been kept alone and hadn't used it .
 It was like the last feeble echo of a sound made a long , long time ago .
 It had lost so much of its liveliness and sound that it was like a beautiful color that has faded away to a faint stain .
 It was so low that it sounded like it was coming from underground .
 It was so sad and hopeless that it would have reminded a starving traveler , exhausted by wandering in the wilderness , of his home and friends just before he lied down to die .
 I want to let a little more light in here , said Defarge , who was still staring at the shoemaker .
 Can you handle a little more light .
 What did you say .
 Can you stand a little more light .
 Defarge propped the half door open a little more .
 A broad shaft of light came into the attic and revealed the shoemaker with an unfinished shoe in his lap as he paused his work .
 A few basic tools and some leather scraps were around him at his feet and on the bench .
 He had a white , ragged beard that wasn't very long , a thin face , and very bright eyes .
 The emptiness and thinness of his face would ordinarily have made his eyes look large under his dark eyebrows and tangled white hair .
 But they were naturally large , so now they looked unnaturally big .
 His yellow , tattered shirt was open at the throat , showing that his body was skinny and worn out .
 The old man , his old coat , his baggy stockings , and his tattered clothes had all been away from light and air for so long that they had turned a single shade of yellow , making it hard to distinguish one from the other .
 He raised his hand to shield his eyes from the light , and even the bones of it seemed transparent .
 He had stopped working and sat there with a steady , empty look .
 He never looked at the man in front of him without first looking down on this side of himself , then on the other , as if he had forgotten how to tell where sound was coming from .
 He never said anything without doing this first , then forgetting to speak .
 Are you going to finish that pair of shoes today .
 asked Defarge , motioning to MrLorry to come forward .
 What did you say .
 Do you plan on finishing that pair of shoes today .
 I can't say that I plan to .
 I guess so .
 I don't know .
 The question reminded him of his work , and he bent over the shoes and started working again .
 You have a visitor , you see , said Monsieur Defarge .
 What did you say .
 There is a visitor here to see you .
 The shoemaker looked up as he had before , but without taking his hand off the shoes .
 Come .
 said Defarge .
 Here is a man who knows a well-made shoe when he sees one .
 Show him that shoe you're working on .
 Take it , monsieur .
 MrLorry took the shoe in his hand .
 Tell this man what kind of shoe it is and who made it .
 There was a longer pause than usual before the shoemaker answered : 
 I forget what you asked me .
 What did you say .
 I said , won't you describe to this man what kind of shoe it is .
 And who made it .
 asked Defarge .
 Did you ask me what my name was .
 Yes , I did .
 My name is One Hundred and Five , North Tower .
 Is that it .
 One Hundred and Five , North Tower .
 With a weary sound that wasn't a sigh or a groan he resumed working , until the silence was broken again .
 You're not a professional shoemaker , are you .
 asked MrLorry , staring at him .
 Am I professional shoemaker .
 No , I was not a professional shoemaker .
 I-I learned how to make shoes here .
 I taught myself .
 I asked permission to .
 He stared off for a few minutes , wringing his hands the whole time .
 Slowly he looked back toward MrLorry .
 When he looked at him he flinched and started up again as if he had just been woken up and was continuing a conversation from the night before .
 Monsieur Manette dropped the shoe and sat staring at MrLorry .
 His mind clouded over again .
 He looked at the two men with less and less understanding , and his eyes wandered back to the ground the way they had before .
 Finally , sighing deeply , he picked up the shoe and went back to work .
 Did you recognize him , monsieur .
 whispered Defarge .
 Miss Manette had moved away from the attic wall and was very close to the bench he sat on .
 There was something terrible about the fact that he was unaware of someone so close she could have reached out and touched him .
 After a while he put down the tool in his hand to pick up his shoemaker's knife .
 It was on the side of the bench opposite where she stood .
 He had picked it up and was leaning over to start working again when he noticed the bottom of her dress .
 He looked up and saw her face .
 MrLorry and Defarge started to move forward to protect her , but she stopped them with a motion of her hand .
 She didn't fear him stabbing her with his knife , though the two men did .
 What is this .
 With tears running down her face , she blew him a kiss with both hands .
 Then she placed her hands on her heart as if she were holding his head to it .
 You aren't the jailer's daughter .
 No , she sighed .
 Who are you .
 Still afraid to speak , she sat down next to him on the bench .
 He pulled away , but she placed her hand on his arm .
 As she did , a strange excitement struck him , and passed through him visibly .
 He gently put down the knife and sat there staring at her .
 Her long , curly blond hair had been brushed aside and fell down over her neck .
 Moving his hand toward her little by little , he picked up her hair and looked at it .
 While doing this , his mind wandered again , and with another deep sigh , he went back to his shoemaking .
 He took her hair in his hand again and looked closely at it .
 It's the same .
 How can that be .
 When .
 How .
 As the intense expression reappeared on his forehead , he seemed to realize that the same expression was on her forehead too .
 He moved her into the light and looked at her .
 He formed these words silently with his lips many times before he could say them out loud .
 When he did finally speak them , he said them clearly , though slowly .
 How did this happen .
 WAS IT YOU .
 Listen .
 Monsieur Manette cried .
 Whose voice was that .
 No , no , no .
 You are too young .
 Too full of life .
 It can't be you .
 These are not the hands she knew , this is not the face she knew , this is not a voice she ever heard .
 No , no .
 She was , and he was , before all those slow-moving years I spent in the North Toweryears ago .
 What is your name , my gentle angel .
 Noticing that he had softened his tone of voice and behavior , his daughter fell down on her knees in front of him and placed her hands on his chest .
 His cold white hair mixed with her shining blond hair , and it was as if her hair warmed his like the light of freedom shining on him .
 If my voiceI don't know if it does , but if soif it reminds you of a voice that was once sweet music in your ears , cry for it .
 If touching my hair reminds you of the head that once rested on your chest when you were young and free , cry for it .
 If I hint that a home awaits you where I will take care of you , and it reminds you of the long-empty home you remembered from afar , cry for it .
 She hugged him around the neck and rocked him back and forth like a child .
 I tell you that your agony is over , and that I've come here to take you from it , and that we're going to England to be at peace .
 If that causes you to think of your wasted life , and how our home country , France , has mistreated you , cry for it .
 When I tell you my name , and about my father who is living , and about my mother who is dead , if you find out that I must beg my father's forgiveness because I didn't stay awake crying all night since my mother never told me of his imprisonment , cry for it .
 Cry for her , then , and for me .
 Gentlemen , thank God .
 I feel God's tears on my face and his sobbing in my heart .
 Thank God .
 More fit to travel , I think , than to stay in this city , where he has been treated so terribly .
 That's a business matter , said MrLorry , going back to his professional demeanor .
 And if business needs to be done , then I should be the one to do it .
 As it grew dark , the young woman lay her head down on the hard ground next to her father and watched him .
 It got darker and darker , and they both lay there quietly until a light shone through the cracks in the wall .
 In the way of a man used to obeying orders , he ate and drank what they gave him , and put on the cloak and other clothes they gave him to wear .
 He happily let his daughter link arms with him and held her hand with both of his .
 Do you remember this place , father .
 Do you remember coming up here .
 What did you say .
 But before she could repeat the question , he mumbled an answer .
 Do I remember .
 No , I don't remember .
 It was such a long time ago .
 Defarge climbed up on the coach and yelled , To the barrier .
 The driver cracked his whip , and the coach drove off under the dim swinging streetlamps .
 Don't you want to be brought back to life .
 And he got the same answer as before : 
 I don't know .
 The end of Book One .
 Tellson's Bank near Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place , even back in 1780 .
 It was very small , very dark , very ugly , and very uncomfortable .
 The partners who ran the bank were old-fashioned too .
 They were proud of its smallness , darkness , ugliness , and discomfort .
 They even boasted that their bank was all these things , and they believed that it if hadn't been so unpleasant , it wouldn't have been so well respected .
 The bankers liked to brag about this to their competitors .
 Tellson's Bank , they would say , didn't need elbow room or bright light or fancy decorations .
 Maybe Noakes and Co .
 or Snooks Brothers needed these things , but not Tellson's Bank .
 Any one these partners would have disinherited his own son for suggesting they refurbish Tellson's .
 In this way , Tellson's was like England , which did often punish its citizens for trying to improve laws and customs .
 But the fact that people had objected to these laws and customs for so long made them more respected .
 The old men who worked in the cramped quarters of Tellson's Bank took their work seriously .
 When the bank hired a young man , they hid him away until he was old .
 When they hired a young man at Tellson's London office , they kept him in a dark place and aged him , like a cheese , until he had the Tellson-flavor and mold grew on him .
 Only then was he allowed to be seen there , studying large books and strutting around with an air of self-importance .
 MrCruncher's apartment was not in a very good neighborhood .
 It had only two rooms , and only if a closet with a tiny window counted as one of them .
 He kept his apartment clean , though .
 As early as it was this windy March morning , his bedroom was already scrubbed clean , and the cups and saucers were set out for breakfast on a clean white tablecloth .
 MrCruncher was asleep under a patchwork quilt , like a Harlequin a clown from Italian comedy that wore a costume made up of multicolored patches Harlequin at home .
 He was sleeping heavily , but little by little he began to toss and turn in bed , with his spiky hair looking like it would tear his sheets to shreds .
 Finally he sat up and yelled out in frustration : 
 Bust me , if she isn't at it again .
 A neatly dressed woman quickly got up off her knees in the corner , with enough speed and fear to show that she was the woman he referred to .
 What .
 said MrCruncher , looking around the bed for his boot .
 You're at it again , are you .
 I was only praying .
 Praying .
 You're a nice woman .
 What are you doing throwing yourself down on your knees and praying against me .
 I'm not praying against you .
 I was praying for you .
 They come from the heart , Jerry .
 They're only worth what they mean to me .
 Muttering other phrases like Oh , yes .
 You're a religious woman , aren't you .
 You would never go against the best interests of your husband and child , would you .
 Not you .
 and making other such sarcastic comments , MrCruncher went about cleaning his boots and getting ready for work .
 Meanwhile , his son , whose hair was slightly less spiked than his father's and whose eyes were close together like his father's , watched his mother as he had been told .
 He kept surprising her by jumping out of his little bedroom where he was washing up and yelling , You were about to kneel down and pray , Mother .
 Hey .
 Father .
 and then , after yelling out this false warning , jumping back into the other room again with a grin .
 MrCruncher was still in a bad mood when he came to eat breakfast .
 He was particularly angry when MrsCruncher said grace .
 His wife explained to him that she was only asking for a blessing .
 Don't do it .
 said MrCruncher while he looked around , as if he expected his wife's prayers to make the loaf of bread on the table disappear .
 I'm not going to let myself be blessed out of house and home .
 I won't let you bless my food right off of my table .
 Keep quiet .
 Blurry-eyed and sullen , as if he had been up all night at a party that had ended badly , Jerry Cruncher ate his breakfast anxiously , growling over it like an animal .
 Around nine o'clock he calmed himself down and , making himself as respectable and professional looking as he could , went out to start his day .
 One of the regular messengers that worked in the bank poked his head out the door and said : 
 We need a porter .
 Hooray , Father .
 Here's an early job to start the day with .
 Having sent his father off , young Jerry sat on the stool , looked at the straw his father had been chewing on , and thought .
 You know the Old Bailey street in London where criminals were tried and imprisoned Old Bailey , don't you .
 one of the bank's oldest clerks asked Jerry .
 Ye-es , sir , answered Jerry , warily .
 I do know the Old Bailey .
 I thought so .
 And you know MrLorry .
 Good .
 Go find the door where they bring the witnesses in , and show the doorman this note for MrLorry .
 He will let you in .
 Into the courtroom , sir .
 MrCruncher narrowed his eyes , as if his eyes were asking each other , What do you think about this .
 Should I wait for him in court , sir .
 MrCruncher asked .
 Is that all , sir .
 That's all .
 He wants a messenger nearby .
 Your job is to let him know that you're there if he needs you .
 I guess they're trying people for forgery this morning .
 That's punishable by quartering dismembering a body into four parts quartering , said Jerry .
 How barbaric .
 It's the law , answered the old clerk , surprised at this comment .
 The law is the law .
 It's a harsh law .
 It's bad enough to kill him , but it's worse to torture him , sir .
 It's this damp weather , sir , that affects my health , said Jerry .
 My job often requires me to be out in wet weather .
 After a few moments , the doorman reluctantly opened the door a little way and allowed MrJerry Cruncher to squeeze into the courtroom .
 What case is this .
 Jerry whispered to the man next to him .
 Nothing yet .
 What case is next .
 The treason case .
 The one where they're going to quarter the man .
 If they decide he's guilty , you mean .
 asked Jerry .
 What's he got to do with this case .
 the man next to Jerry asked about MrLorry .
 I have no idea , said Jerry .
 What do you have to do with it , if I may ask .
 I don't know that either , said Jerry .
 A mirror hung over the prisoner's head to reflect light down onto him .
 Over the years this mirror had reflected the images of many poor and wicked prisoners who had eventually been put to death .
 If that mirror were ever able to send those reflections back out , the courtroom would have been filled with ghosts .
 The prisoner may have thought about how disgraceful it was to have this mirror there .
 He shifted and a shaft of light shining across his face made him look up .
 When he saw his reflection , he blushed and brushed the herbs off of the bar in front of him .
 As he made this gesture , he turned his face to his left .
 His eyes fell upon two people sitting near the judge's bench .
 His expression changed so much when he saw them that everyone who was watching turned to look .
 The two people were a young lady a little older than twenty years old and a gentleman who was apparently her father .
 He was a remarkable-looking man with white hair and an indescribable intensity in his face .
 This intense expression made him look like an old man .
 But when the expression left his face , as it had now while he talked to his daughter , he looked handsome and in the prime of his life .
 His daughter sat arm in arm with her father .
 Her fear and pity for the prisoner had made her pull close to him .
 The expression on her forehead revealed her compassion for the prisoner .
 This expression was so heartbreaking that it moved even those people who had had no pity for the prisoner .
 The crowd whispered to one another , Who are they .
 Jerry , who had been observing the scene while he sucked the rust off of his fingers , leaned in to hear who they were .
 The crowd around him had passed the question forward to the person closest to the two people .
 The answer was slowly passed back until it got to Jerry : 
 They are witnesses .
 Against .
 Against which side .
 Against the prisoner .
 When the attorney general finished , the crowd started to buzz with excitement , like a cloud of flies , in anticipation of the prisoner's death .
 When the noise died down , the ideal patriot the attorney general had described entered the witness box .
 The man asked John Barsad if he had ever been a spy himself .
 No , Barsad answered indignantly .
 How did he make his living .
 He made his living off of his property .
 Where was his property .
 He didn't quite remember .
 What was this property .
 No one's business .
 Had he inherited it .
 Yes , he had .
 From whom .
 A distant relative .
 Very distant .
 Yes , very distant .
 Had he ever been in prison .
 Of course not .
 He had never been to debtor's prison .
 He didn't see what that has to do with it .
 So he'd never been to debtor's prison .
 He asked that the question be repeated .
 Never been to debtor's prison .
 Yes .
 How many times .
 Two or three times .
 Not five or six times .
 Maybe .
 What's your profession .
 I am a gentleman .
 Have you been ever been kicked in a fight .
 Maybe .
 Often .
 No .
 Ever been kicked down a flight of stairs .
 Of course not .
 Once , though , someone kicked me at the top of a staircase and I happened to fall down the stairs on my own .
 Were you kicked because you'd been caught cheating at dice .
 That's what the drunken liar who kicked me said , but it wasn't true .
 You swear it wasn't true .
 Definitely .
 Ever make money by cheating at gambling .
 Never .
 Ever make money by gambling .
 No more than other gentlemen .
 Ever borrow money from the prisoner .
 Yes .
 Ever pay him back .
 No .
 Wasn't your familiarity with the prisoner actually very limited , created by you deliberately bumping into him in coaches , inns , and ships .
 No .
 Are you sure you saw the prisoner with these lists .
 I'm sure .
 You didn't know anything else about these lists .
 No .
 You didn't get them yourself , for instance .
 No .
 Do you expect to get anything in return for testifying against him .
 No .
 You're not employed by the British government to entrap people .
 Of course not .
 Or to do anything else .
 No .
 You swear .
 I'll swear it over and over again .
 You have no motives for doing this other than love for your country .
 None whatsoever .
 There was another buzz in the courtroom , and the attorney general called MrJarvis Lorry to the stand .
 MrJarvis Lorry , are you a clerk at Tellson's Bank .
 I am .
 On a certain Friday night in November 1775 , did your job require that you take the mail coach from London to Dover .
 It did .
 Were there any other passengers in the coach .
 Two other passengers .
 Did they get out of the coach at some point during the night .
 Yes , they did .
 MrLorry , look at the prisoner .
 Was he one of those two passengers .
 I don't know .
 Does he resemble either of the two passengers .
 Both of them were bundled up , it was dark , and we all kept to ourselves , so I can't be sure if he looked like one of the passengers or not .
 MrLorry , imagine the prisoner wrapped up like those two passengers .
 Is there anything about his build or height that would make you think that he was not one of them .
 No .
 MrLorry , you cannot say for sure that he was not one of those two men .
 No .
 So you're saying he might have been one of them .
 Yes .
 Except that I remember them both being afraid of thieves , like I was , and the prisoner doesn't look like a man who's afraid of anything .
 Did you ever see someone pretend to be afraid , MrLorry .
 I certainly have .
 MrLorry , look at the prisoner again .
 Have you ever seen him before .
 I have .
 When .
 What time did he come on board .
 A little after midnight .
 In the middle of the night .
 Was he the only passenger that came on board so late .
 Forget about whether he ëhappened' to be the only one .
 Was he the only passenger to come on board in the middle of the night .
 Yes , he was .
 Were you traveling alone , MrLorry , or were you with someone .
 I was with two other people .
 A gentleman and a lady .
 They are here in the courtroom .
 They are here .
 Did you speak with the prisoner .
 The young woman , whom everyone had been watching earlier , stood up , and the crowd turned to look at her .
 Her father stood up with her and kept his hand linked through her arm .
 Miss Manette , take a look at the prisoner .
 To look at such a young , beautiful woman with such pity in her eyes was harder for the prisoner than the stares of the entire crowd .
 He couldn't stand still while looking at her , knowing he was about to die and knowing that everyone was watching him .
 He brushed the herbs in front of him into little lines , like beds of flowers in a garden .
 His lips trembled as he tried to steady his breathing .
 The crowd started to buzz again .
 Miss Manette , have you seen the prisoner before .
 Yes , sir .
 Where .
 You are the young woman MrLorry referred to .
 Oh .
 Unfortunately , I am .
 Miss Manette , did you talk to the prisoner at all during the journey across the Channel .
 Yes , sir .
 Describe the conversation .
 The courtroom was silent as she began quietly : When the gentleman came on board .
 By ëgentleman , ' do you mean the prisoner .
 asked the judge , frowning .
 Yes , my lord .
 Then say ëthe prisoner .
 Let me interrupt you for a moment .
 Did he come on board alone .
 No .
 How many people were with him .
 Two French gentlemen .
 Did they speak together .
 They spoke together until the very last moment , when the two French gentlemen took their boat back to shore .
 They passed some papers between them , but I don't know what they were .
 Were they the same shape and size as these papers .
 Tell us about your conversation with the prisoner , Miss Manette .
 The courtroom buzzed with excitement .
 Did he say anything about America , Miss Manette .
 Be specific .
 A crowd will always mimic the expression on the face of an actor in a play they are watching .
 Miss Manette's forehead was wrinkled up as she gave her evidence , waited for the judge to write down what she said , and watched the lawyers to see how they would react .
 All the people in the crowd had the same expression on their foreheads , as if they were mirrors reflecting Miss Manette .
 The judge looked up , angered by the comment about George Washington .
 Can you identify him as the man you met on board the boat from Calais , or verify that he had this conversation with your daughter .
 I can't do either , sir .
 Is there some reason why .
 There is , he answered quietly .
 A long imprisonment , he answered in a tone that provoked pity .
 Had you just been released on the night in question .
 That's what they tell me .
 Do you remember that night .
 Not at all .
 I don't remember anything from a long periodI can't even say how long .
 I've forgotten everything from the time when I was making shoes in prison to when I found myself living in London with my daughter .
 I began to recognize her when I started to get my senses back .
 I have no memory of how it happened , though .
 The witness said he was sure .
 Have you ever seen anyone who looked like the prisoner .
 Not so much like him that I could confuse the two , said the witness .
 Look closely at my esteemed friend over there , he said , pointing to the man who had tossed the paper .
 Now look closely at the prisoner .
 Do they look like each other .
 But MrCarton was paying closer attention to the scene than it appeared .
 When Miss Manette dropped her head onto her father's chest , he was the first person to say loudly , Officer .
 Assist that young woman .
 Help the gentleman take her out of the room .
 Can't you see she's about to faint .
 The crowd was very sympathetic to her and her father as they left the courtroom .
 It had apparently been very stressful for him to think back on his time in prison .
 The questioning had clearly upset him , and that thoughtful or brooding expression that made him look older had been on his face ever since .
 As he was leaving , the foreman spoke on behalf of the jury , who were once again facing forward .
 Jerry , you can go get something to eat , but stay close by .
 I'm sure you will hear when the jury comes in .
 Get back here as soon as they do .
 I want you to take the verdict back to the bank .
 You're the fastest messenger I know , and you'll get back to Temple Bar much faster than I can .
 MrLorry gave him a shilling , and Jerry agreed to deliver the message .
 At that moment , MrCarton came up to MrLorry and tapped him on the arm .
 How is the young lady .
 She's very upset , but her father is comforting her .
 She feels better now that she is out of the courtroom .
 I'll tell the prisoner .
 It wouldn't be proper if people saw a respectable banker like you speaking to him in public .
 The prisoner immediately stepped forward .
 I'm sure you are anxious to hear how the witness , Miss Manette , is doing .
 She is doing very well .
 She got through the worst of it .
 I am very sorry that I caused her distress .
 Could you tell her for me , with my sincerest apologies .
 MrCarton's attitude was so casual that it was almost rude .
 He stood there , partly facing away from the prisoner , leaning with his elbow against the bar .
 I would like that .
 Thank you .
 Guilty .
 It's smart of you to expect that , as it's the most likely .
 But I think their long deliberation could work in your favor .
 MrLorry was already calling for him when he arrived .
 I'm here , sir .
 It's a fight to get back through this crowd .
 Here I am , sir .
 MrLorry handed a piece of paper to him through the crowd .
 Quick .
 Do you have it .
 Yes , sir .
 The word Acquitted had been quickly scribbled down on the paper .
 If you had sent the message ëBrought back to life' again I would have understood it this time , muttered Jerry .
 Jerry didn't have time to say or think anything else until he was out of the Old Bailey .
 The crowd came pouring out of the courtroom so quickly that they nearly knocked him over , and their loud buzz spread into the streets as if they were flies in search of other carrion .
 Only his daughter could bring him back from this melancholy brooding .
 She was the one thing that connected his past , before his imprisonment , to his present .
 The sound of her voice , the look on her face , or the touch of her hand almost always made him feel better .
 There had a few times when she hadn't been able to help him , but these instances were rare and she felt they were now over .
 MrStryver still wore his wig and gown , and he stood in front of MrDarnay in such a way that MrLorry was edged out of the conversation entirely .
 I am happy I represented you honorably , MrDarnay , said MrStryver .
 It was a villainous case they had against you , but that doesn't mean they couldn't have succeeded .
 I am indebted to your for life , in two senses of the word , said MrDarnay , shaking his hand .
 Do you think so .
 asked MrStryver .
 Well .
 You've been here all day and you ought to know .
 You're a businessman , too .
 Speak for yourself , MrLorry , said Stryver .
 I have work to do tonight .
 Speak for yourself .
 The look faded from his face , and he turned to look at her .
 Shall we go home , Father .
 Yes , he answered with a long sigh .
 Nobody had mentioned the role MrCarton had played in the events of the day .
 Nobody had noticed him there .
 He wasn't wearing his robe anymore and looked worse than he had in the courtroom .
 If you knew how conflicted businessmen become when they are caught between doing the right thing and the professional thing , you would find it funny , MrDarnay , said MrCarton .
 MrLorry blushed and said in a friendly manner , You have said that before , sir .
 We men of business , who work for a company , cannot think only of ourselves .
 We have to think of what's best for the company .
 Business .
 I have no business , said MrCarton .
 It's a shame that you don't , sir , said MrLorry .
 I think so , too .
 If you did have business , continued MrLorry , perhaps you could go take care of it .
 MrLorry may have been mad at both himself and MrCarton , and he climbed into the chair and headed off to Tellson's Bank .
 Carton , who smelled like port wine and appeared to be a bit drunk , laughed and turned to Darnay : 
 It's pretty odd that you and I are here together .
 This must be a strange night for you , standing here alone on the street with a man who looks just like you .
 I still don't feel like I belong to the world of the living , answered Charles Darnay .
 I'm not surprised .
 It wasn't long ago that you were close to being put to death .
 Your voice is weak .
 I feel weak .
 Then why don't you eat dinner .
 I ate dinner myself while those idiots in the jury were arguing about whether you should live or die .
 Let me show you the closest good tavern .
 Do you feel like you belong to the world of the living yet , MrDarnay .
 You must be very happy about that .
 He spoke bitterly and refilled his large wine glass .
 MrDarnay was confused by the emotions of the day , and it felt like a dream to be with this man who looked so much like himself , but behaved so roughly .
 He didn't know how to respond to this statement , and finally , he decided not to answer at all .
 To Miss Manette , then .
 To Miss Manette .
 Staring into MrDarnay's face while he drank to the toast , Carton flung his wine glass over his shoulder against the wall , where it shattered .
 Then he rang the bell and ordered another .
 That's a beautiful young lady to send away in a coach at night , MrDarnay .
 he said , handling his new glass .
 Yes , said MrDarnay , frowning slightly .
 Again Darnay didn't answer .
 She was very happy to receive your message when I gave it to her .
 She didn't show that she was pleased , but I think she was .
 This comment reminded Darnay that Carton had helped him by delivering this message .
 He turned the conversation to that fact and thanked him for his help .
 I don't want or deserve any thanks , he said casually .
 First of all , it was nothing .
 And second , I don't even know why I did it .
 Let me ask you a question , MrDarnay .
 Do you think that I like you .
 Really , MrCarton , answered MrDarnay , a bit flustered by the question , I haven't thought much about it .
 Think about it now .
 I don't think I do like you , said Carton .
 I'm starting to think highly of your intelligence .
 Carton answered , Not on your life .
 Darnay rang the bell .
 Do you call us even .
 MrDarnay answered that yes , he did .
 Then bring me another pint of this wine , waiter , and wake me in my room at ten o'clock .
 I think you have been drinking , MrCarton .
 You think .
 You know I have been drinking .
 Yes , I know it .
 Then I will tell you why .
 I am unhappy and overworked , sir .
 I don't like anyone in the world , and no one likes me .
 I'm sorry to hear that .
 You might have put your skills to better use .
 Perhaps , MrDarnay .
 Perhaps not .
 Don't let your sober self get too excited .
 You don't know what trouble you might get yourself into .
 Good night .
 MrStryver had been popular at the Old Bailey and at the Sessions lower criminal court Sessions , but he had started to leave his colleagues behind as his ambition drove him forward .
 The Sessions and the Old Bailey now had to summon him to get him to visit .
 MrStryver could be seen every day shoving himself past these old colleagues into the view of the Lord Chief Justice in the Court of King's Bench , like a sunflower shoving past the nearby flowers toward the sun .
 It was once said at the bar that although MrStryver was persuasive , immoral , bold , and well prepared , he was not skilled at getting to the core of complex matters , which is one of the most important skills a lawyer needs .
 He was improving , though .
 The more cases he worked on , the better he became at finding the crux of an argument .
 And no matter how late he stayed up drinking with Sydney Carton , he was always well prepared the next morning .
 Ten o'clock , sir .
 What do you mean .
 Ten o'clock at night .
 Yes , sir .
 You told me to wake you .
 Oh .
 I remember .
 Very well , very well .
 You're a little late , Memory , said Stryver .
 I'm here around the usual time .
 Maybe I'm fifteen minutes late .
 They went into a dirty little room , filled with books and papers , where there was a blazing fire .
 A kettle was steaming on the stove , an in the middle of the mess of papers , there was a table with wine , brandy , rum , sugar , and lemons .
 I see you've already had a bottle of wine , Sydney .
 I thought that he was rather a good-looking man , and I thought I would have been the same kind of man , if I'd had any luck .
 MrStryver laughed until his belly shook .
 You and your luck , Sydney .
 Get to work , get to work .
 Not much work to be done tonight , Memory , said MrStryver happily as he looked at his papers .
 How much .
 Only two sets of them .
 Give me the worst one first .
 Here they are , Sydney .
 Fire away .
 And now that we're finished , Sydney , fill a glass of punch , said MrStryver .
 With a disapproving grunt , MrCarton did what he was told .
 And why not .
 God only knows .
 It was just the way I was , I guess .
 He sat with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out in front of him , looking at the fire .
 Don't bother me , answered Sydney , with a somewhat cheerful laugh .
 Don't you moralize .
 Partly by paying me to help you , I suppose .
 But don't bother lecturing me about it .
 You do what you want to do .
 You were always on the front lines , and I was always in back .
 I had to push my way to the front lines .
 I wasn't born there , was I .
 Before Shrewsbury , and at Shrewsbury , and ever since Shrewsbury , continued Carton , you have always been ahead and I have always been behind .
 Even when we were in Paris studying French and French law , and trying to learn other French things that weren't very good for us , you were always going somewhere and I was always going nowhere .
 And whose fault was that .
 Well then .
 Let's talk about that pretty witness , said Stryver , holding his glass .
 Is that a more pleasant topic .
 Apparently it wasn't , for he got depressed again .
 Pretty witness , muttered Carton , staring into his glass .
 I've had enough of witnesses today and tonight .
 Which pretty witness are you talking about .
 Miss Manette , the doctor's beautiful daughter .
 Isn't she .
 No .
 Why , everyone in the courtroom was admiring her .
 Who cares .
 Who made the Old Bailey a judge of beauty .
 She looked like a blond doll .
 Interested to see what happened to her .
 A man can tell if a girl is about to faint right in front of his face .
 I agree to that , but I deny that she's beautiful .
 I'm done drinking .
 I'm going to bed .
 On this particular fine Sunday , MrLorry walked toward Soho early in the afternoon for three reasons .
 First of all , on nice Sundays he often went out for a walk with the doctor and Lucie before lunch .
 Secondly , on Sundays when the weather was bad , he often spent the day with them as a family friend at their house , talking , reading , looking out the window , and generally getting through the day .
 Thirdly , he had his own problems to work out , and the time at the doctor's house was a good time to work them out .
 The handmaid answered that he was expected home soon .
 Is Miss Lucie home .
 The handmaid answered that she too was expected home soon .
 Is Miss Pross home .
 The handmade answered that she might be at home but that she couldn't say for sure .
 Since I feel at home here myself , I'll go upstairs , said MrLorry .
 It's strange that he keeps that reminder of his suffering near him , said MrLorry , looking around .
 And why is that strange .
 was the unexpected question that made him jump .
 I should have thought MrLorry began .
 I am pretty well , thank you , answered MrLorry meekly .
 How are you .
 Nothing to brag about , said Miss Pross .
 Indeed .
 Ah .
 Indeed .
 said Miss Pross .
 I am very unhappy about Miss Manette .
 Indeed .
 Really , then .
 said MrLorry , changing his phrase .
 Really' is bad , but it's better than ëindeed .
 Yes , I am very unhappy .
 May I ask why .
 I don't want dozens of people who are unworthy of Miss Manette coming here to looking for her , said Miss Pross .
 Do dozens of people come here for that .
 Hundreds , said Miss Pross .
 Miss Pross had the habit , like many other people before and after her , to exaggerate her point after someone questioned it .
 I have lived with heror rather , she has lived with mesince she was ten years old and paid me for it .
 She certainly shouldn't have if I could have afforded to take care of her or myself for nothing .
 It's been very hard , said Miss Pross .
 MrLorry didn't understand what exactly was very hard , so he shook his head .
 He used this gesture of shaking his head as a kind of magical cloak , which would fit any occasion the way a magical cloak would fit anyone .
 All sorts of people who are not worthy of her keep showing up , said Miss Pross .
 When you started it .
 When I started it , Miss Pross .
 Didn't you .
 Who brought her father back to life .
 Oh .
 If that's what you mean by starting it said MrLorry .
 There has only ever been one man worthy of Miss Manette , said Miss Pross .
 That was my brother , Solomon , if he hadn't made a mistake in life .
 Never .
 And yet he keeps his bench and tools near him .
 Do you believe he thinks of it often .
 I do , said Miss Pross .
 Do you imagine MrLorry started , but Miss Pross cut him off with : 
 Never imagine anything .
 It's better to have no imagination at all .
 I stand corrected .
 Do you supposeyou do suppose still , don't you .
 Now and then , said Miss Pross .
 I don't suppose anything but what Miss Manette tells me .
 And that is .
 She thinks that he does .
 Dull .
 asked Miss Pross calmly .
 Well .
 As well as I understand it , which is not well at all , he is afraid of the whole topic , said Miss Pross .
 Afraid .
 I think it's clear enough why he would be .
 It's a dreadful thing to remember .
 Besides that , he lost part of himself in prison .
 Not knowing how he lost himself , or how he eventually found himself again , he might never feel certain that he won't lose himself again .
 That alone would make it an unpleasant subject , I would think .
 The street corner , as was mentioned earlier , was a good place for echoes .
 MrLorry could now hear the echo of footsteps coming toward them as if the mention of pacing up and down had started it .
 They're here .
 said Miss Pross , getting up from her chair .
 And soon there will be hundreds of people here to visit Miss Manette .
 On Sundays , Miss Pross ate at the same table as the doctor , but on other days she insisted on eating at unknown times , either downstairs or in her own room on the second floor .
 Her room was a blue room that no one was allowed to enter except for Lucie .
 On this occasion , Miss Pross went out of her way to make a good meal to please the beautiful Lucie , so the food was very good .
 It was a hot day , and after lunch Lucie suggested that they take their wine out under the plane tree , where they could sit in the fresh air .
 As everyone always did what Lucie wanted , they all went out under the plane tree .
 Lucie carried the wine down for MrLorry .
 She had taken on the role of MrLorry's cup bearer , and while they sat under the plane tree talking , she made sure his glass was always full .
 They could see the backs of other houses from where they sat talking , and the wind blew gently through the leaves of the plane tree above their heads .
 Hundreds of people still did not arrive .
 MrDarnay came by while they were sitting under the plane tree , but he was the only one .
 I have been there , as you know , said Darnay , smiling , though his face turned a bit red with anger , in a different way , and not in a way that allows someone to see much of it .
 They told me something interesting when I was there .
 What was that .
 asked Lucie .
 At teatime , while Miss Pross made tea , she had another twitching fit like she had before , and hundreds of people had still not arrived to visit Miss Manette .
 MrCarton had arrived , but he was only the second person to come by .
 The storm is on its way , said Carton .
 People were running through the streets trying to get inside before the storm broke .
 The street corner was filled with the echoes of footsteps coming and going , even though no one could actually be seen walking there .
 It sounds like so many people , and yet no one is there .
 said Darnay after they had listened for a while .
 Isn't it impressive , MrDarnay .
 asked Lucie .
 Some nights I have sat here until I have imaginedbut even something silly I have imagined makes me shudder tonight , when everything is so dark and serious .
 Let us shudder too .
 Tell us what it is .
 It will seem like nothing to you .
 Such ideas are only interesting as we make them up , I think .
 They shouldn't be told to others .
 I have sometimes sat here alone at night , listening until I have imagined that all of the echoes are the echoes of the footsteps of the people that will soon be coming into our lives .
 A lot of people will be coming into our lives if that's the case , added Sydney Carton in his moody way .
 The footsteps never stopped .
 They sped up more and more , and the corner echoed and re-echoed with their sound .
 Some seemed to be under the windows , and some seemed to be in the room .
 Some were coming and some were going .
 Some of them were breaking off and some stopped altogether .
 All were in the streets in the distance , and no one was in sight .
 I'll accept them into my life .
 said Carton .
 I ask no questions and have no conditions .
 There are a lot of people coming toward us , Miss Manetteand I can see them by the lightning .
 He added the last words just after a bright flash of lightning , which illuminated him as he lounged in the window .
 And I hear them .
 he added , after a roar of thunder .
 Here they come , fast , fierce , and furious .
 He was talking about the rush and roar of rain , and he stopped talking because he couldn't be heard over the rain .
 A terrific storm of thunder and lightning broke , and the thunder , lightning , and rain did not stop even for an instant until after the moon rose at midnight .
 Good night , MrCarton , said MrLorry .
 Good night , MrDarnay .
 Do you think we'll ever see such a night together again .
 They might .
 They might also see a great roaring crowd of people come rushing at them , too .
 The monseigneur had one truly noble idea about public business in general : to let everything continue on its own .
 For specific kinds of public business he had another respectable idea : that it should benefit him personally and give him more power or money .
 He believed that the world had been created to bring him pleasure .
 The text of his class , which had only been changed by one pronoun , read , The earth and its fullness are mine , says the monseigneur .
 The tax collector was an extravagant man .
 He had thirty horses in his stables , twenty-four manservants in his house , and six maids served his wife .
 Though his in-laws looked down on him , the tax collector was the most honest of the people at the monseigneur's hotel that day as he didn't hide the fact that all he did was steal and take what he could .
 Elegant , well-bred gentlemen , who , then just as now , have been known by their lack of interest in any interesting subject , were in a fine state of exhaustion at the monseigneur's .
 The spies in the upper-class world of Paris would have had trouble finding one wife in the homes of these men who would admit that she was a mother .
 Indeed , except for the act of giving birth , which doesn't give someone the right to be called a mother , babies were out of fashion .
 Peasant women took care of the babies and brought them up , while sixty-year-old grandmothers acted like twenty-year-olds .
 Monseigneur had taken his chocolate from his four servants and eaten it , and he opened the doors of his inner chamber and came out .
 When he did , everyone started bowing , scraping , fawning , and generally humiliating themselves before him .
 Everyone did so much bowing and praying for the monseigneur that nothing was left for Heaven , which might have been one of several reason why the monseigneur's worshippers never went there .
 With that he shook the snuff off his fingers as if he had shaken dust off his feet and walked quietly downstairs .
 The man went downstairs into the courtyard , got into his carriage , and drove away .
 Not many people had talked to him at the party .
 He had kept a little apart from the rest , and the monseigneur hadn't been particularly friendly to him .
 As a result , he seemed to enjoy seeing the common people running out of the way of his horses , often barely avoiding being run down .
 His driver drove as if he were charging at an enemy , and this recklessness didn't change the master's facial expression at all .
 Complaints had sometimes been heardeven in Paris back then , when no one usually cared about such thingsthat the upper-class custom of driving hard in the narrow streets without sidewalks endangered and maimed the poor in a barbarous manner .
 But few people cared enough to think twice about it , and as in every other matter , the poor were left to get out of trouble on their own .
 Why is he howling like that .
 Is it his child .
 The fountain was a little set off from the street , for the street opened into a space of about ten or twelve square yards .
 The tall man suddenly got up from the ground and ran toward the carriage .
 Monsieur the marquis reached for the handle of his sword .
 He's been killed .
 screamed the man , extending both arms over his head desperately .
 He's dead .
 The marquis took out his purse .
 I'm amazed that you people can't take care of yourselves and your children .
 One or another of you is always getting in the way .
 Who knows how badly you've hurt my horses .
 Here .
 Give him that .
 He tossed a gold coin on the ground for the driver to pick up , and everyone leaned forward to watch it as it fell .
 The tall man cried out again desperately , He's dead .
 Another man , for whom everyone else made way , arrived quickly and stopped him .
 On seeing this late comer , the meek man fell onto his shoulder , sobbing and crying and pointing to the fountain where some women were bent over the motionless bundle .
 They moved around it gently , completely silent , as were the men .
 I know , I know , said the man who had just arrived .
 Be brave , Gaspard .
 It is better for the poor child to die this way than to live .
 It has died in an instant without suffering .
 Could it have lived one hour as happily .
 You are a philosopher , said the marquis , smiling .
 What is your name .
 My name is Defarge .
 What is your job .
 I sell wine , monsieur the marquis .
 Pick that up , you philosopher and seller of wine , said the marquis , throwing down another gold coin .
 Spend it however you like .
 Are the horses all right .
 Stop .
 said monsieur the marquis .
 Stop the horses .
 Who threw that .
 The people were so used to being subservient , and had so much bad experience that they knew what a man like the marquis could do to them , legally or otherwise , that no one said or did anything .
 None of the men even raised an eye .
 Only the woman who stood there knitting looked up steadily , and looked the marquis in the face .
 He was too dignified to even notice .
 His hate-filled eyes passed over her , and over the whole crowd of vermin .
 He leaned back in his seat again and yelled to the driver , Go on .
 Monsieur the marquis rode in his traveling carriage , which was loaded with unnecessary things .
 The carriage was conducted by four horses and two guards on horseback , all struggling up a steep hill .
 The marquis's face was blushing red , but not because he wasn't of good breeding .
 The redness didn't come from within but from an external source beyond his control : the sunset .
 The light from the sunset shone so strongly into the traveling carriage when it reached the top of the hill that the marquis was covered in a crimson light .
 The light will die out soon , said the marquis as he glanced at his hands .
 Bring that man over to me .
 said the marquis to the messenger .
 Did I pass you on the road .
 Yes , Monseigneur .
 I had the honor of seeing you on the road .
 It's true , Monseigneur .
 What were you looking at so intently .
 Monseigneur , I was looking at the man .
 He bent down a little , and with his tattered blue cap he pointed under the carriage .
 Everyone around him bent over to look under the carriage .
 What man , you pig .
 Why were you looking there .
 Who .
 asked the monseigneur .
 The man , Monseigneur .
 Curse these idiots .
 What was the man's name .
 You know all the men in this part of the country .
 Who was he .
 Have mercy on me , Monseigneur .
 He was not from this part of the country .
 I'd never seen him before in my life .
 He was hanging onto the chain .
 Was he trying to suffocate himself .
 What was the man like .
 Really , you did well to see a thief traveling under my carriage and not say anything , said the marquis sarcastically , aware that he shouldn't let poor people bother him .
 Bah .
 Hold him , Monsieur Gabelle .
 Bah .
 Go aside .
 said Monsieur Gabelle .
 I am happy to be of service , Monseigneur .
 Did he run away , fellow .
 Where did that accursed man go .
 Did the man run away , you dolt , when we stopped to apply the brake .
 Monseigneur , he jumped over the side of the hill , headfirst , the way a person jumps into a river .
 Look into it , Gabelle .
 Then he yelled to the driver , Let's go .
 The six or so people who had been looking at the chain were still near the wheels .
 The wheels turned so quickly that they were lucky to get out of the way and to save their skin and bones .
 They were all very skinny , and there wasn't much else left of them , otherwise they might not have been so lucky .
 A woman was kneeling at the foot of this figure .
 She turned her head as the carriage came near her and quickly got up and went to stand at the carriage door .
 It's you , Monseigneur .
 I have a petition for you .
 What .
 What is it .
 Always petitions .
 What about your husband the forester .
 It's always the same with you people .
 He can't afford to pay for something .
 He has paid all that he has , Monseigneur .
 He is dead .
 Good .
 He's quiet .
 Can I bring him back to life for you .
 Sadly , no , Monseigneur .
 But he is buried over there under a sad little heap of grass .
 Again , so .
 She looked like an old woman , but she was in fact young .
 She wrung her vein-covered , rough hands together with wild energy and placed one of them on the door of the carriage .
 She did it tenderly as if placing her hand on someone's chest , as if the carriage could feel her touch .
 Listen to me , Monseigneur .
 Listen to my petition .
 My husband died of hunger .
 So many people do .
 So many more people will die from hunger .
 Again , so .
 Can I feed them all .
 By then the marquis was at his large , high-roofed house , which was surrounded by trees .
 A torch was lit , and his carriage stopped and a large door of his chateau was opened for him .
 Not yet , Monseigneur , the servant replied .
 He probably won't arrive tonight .
 But leave the table as it is anyway .
 I will be ready for dinner in fifteen minutes .
 What is that .
 he asked calmly , looking at the horizontal lines of black on the stone floor .
 Outside the blinds .
 Open the blinds .
 The servant opened the blinds .
 It's nothing , Monseigneur .
 There's nothing outside but the trees and the darkness .
 Good , said the marquis calmly .
 Close the blinds again .
 The servant closed the blinds and the marquis went back to eating his supper .
 He had finished half of it when he stopped eating again with his glass of wine in his hands .
 He had heard the sound of wheels , and the sound grew closer and quickly came up to the front of the house .
 Find out who has arrived .
 It was the monseigneur's nephew .
 He had been a few leagues a league is about three miles leagues behind the monseigneur early in the afternoon .
 He had been catching up to him quickly , but not quickly enough to arrive with him at the house .
 At the posting house he had been told that the monseigneur was ahead of him .
 The servants told the nephew that supper was waiting for him and that the monseigneur wanted him to join him .
 He came to supper shortly after he arrived .
 In England , the monseigneur's nephew was known as Charles Darnay .
 The monseigneur was polite when he arrived , but they did not shake hands .
 You left Paris yesterday , sir .
 he asked the monseigneur as he sat down at the table .
 Yes , yesterday .
 And you .
 I came here directly .
 From London .
 It took you a long time to get here , said the marquis , smiling .
 No .
 I came directly .
 Excuse me .
 I didn't mean a long time in your journey .
 I meant a long time intending to come here .
 I have been delayed by the nephew paused various business .
 Without a doubt , said the marquis calmly .
 As you guess , I have come back , sir , looking for the object that took me away in the first place .
 It put me in great and unexpected danger .
 But it is a sacred object , and even if it had led to my death , I hope it would have protected me .
 Don't say ëto death , ' said the uncle .
 It's not necessary to say to death .
 I doubt , sir , that if it had carried me to the very brink of death , you would have stopped me there , answered the nephew .
 The expression on the marquis's face , and the dents in his nose , ominously suggested that was true .
 The uncle made a graceful gesture of protest , but it was so apparent that he was only being polite that it wasn't very reassuring .
 Indeed , sir , as far as I know , you may have arranged to make my already suspicious circumstances look even more suspicious .
 No , no , no , said the uncle , pleasantly .
 But whether that's true or not , continued the nephew , looking at him suspiciously , I know that you would stop me any way you could , and use any means necessary .
 I remember that .
 Thank you , said the marquis , very sweetly .
 The tone of his voice stayed in the air like the tone of a musical instrument .
 I don't quite understand , answered the uncle , sipping his coffee .
 Can you explain .
 I believe that if you weren't out of favor with the court , and had not been for years , that a letter de cachet official documents that could be used to send someone to prison letter de cachet would have put me in prison indefinitely .
 I see that , luckily for me , you were received coldly two days ago at the monseigneur's reception , as usual , said the nephew .
 The marquis inhaled a pinch of snuff powdered tobacco that is sniffed up the nostrils snuff and shook his head .
 He was as elegantly unhappy as he could be with a country where he and his family still lived .
 We have used the power of our family's position , both in the old days and today , to such a degree , said Darnay unhappily , that I think our name is more hated that any name in France .
 Let's hope so , said the uncle .
 Hatred of the upper classes is the involuntary respect of the low classes .
 The only philosophy left is oppression .
 The dark respect of fear and slavery , my friend , will keep the peasants in line as long as this roof blocks out the sky , he said , looking up at the ceiling .
 That might not be as long as the marquis thought .
 If someone had shown him a picture of his chateau a few years later , and a picture of fifty others like it , he might not have been able to tell his house from the other burned , destroyed wrecks .
 As far as the roof , he might have discovered it blocking out the sky in a new awayshutting it out from the sight of the people who were shot by the bullets of a hundred thousand muskets .
 Meanwhile , said the marquis , I will preserve the honor and faith of our family , if you won't .
 But you must be tired .
 Should we end our meeting for the night .
 One more minute .
 We can continue for another hour if you want .
 Sir , said the nephew , we have done wrong , and we are reaping the benefits of these wrongdoings .
 We have done wrong .
 the marquis repeated with a questioning smile , delicately pointing at his nephew and then to himself .
 Death has separated us .
 said the marquis .
 My friend , I will die preserving the system under which I have lived .
 When he said it , he inhaled a pinch of snuff and put the snuffbox in his pocket .
 Better to be a rational creature , he added after ringing a small bell on the table , and accept your natural destiny .
 But I can see that you are lost , Monsieur Charles .
 Our family's property and all of this country are lost to me , said the nephew , sadly .
 I am giving them up .
 I have no plan to claim it yet .
 If I inherited it from you tomorrow .
 Which I hope , for my sake , is not likely , the marquis said .
 Or twenty years from now .
 You're too kind , said the marquis .
 Still , I prefer the possibility that I may live that long .
 I would give it up and go live a different kind of life somewhere else .
 It isn't much to give up .
 It only brings me misery .
 Hah .
 said the marquis , looking around his finely decorated room .
 Hah .
 said the marquis again , in a well-satisfied manner .
 In England , perhaps .
 Yes .
 I will not tarnish the family name there .
 The family name can't harm me elsewhere , since I do not use it in other countries .
 When the marquis had rung the bell , his valet lit the bedroom next door .
 Bright light now shone from it through the doorway .
 The marquis looked that way and listened until he had heard his valet walk away .
 I have told you already that I may be indebted to you , sir , for my success there .
 Otherwise , it has been a safe haven for me .
 Those bragging English say that it is a safe haven for many people .
 Do you know another Frenchman who has also found safety there .
 A doctor .
 With a daughter .
 Yes , said the marquis .
 You are tired .
 Good night .
 Yes , repeated the marquis .
 A doctor with a daughter .
 Yes .
 So begins the new way of thinking .
 You are tired .
 Good night .
 It would have been as useful to question the stone faces outside the chateau as it was to question the marquis's face .
 The nephew looked at him as he passed him on his way out the door , but he couldn't tell what he was thinking .
 I am cooler now and am ready to go to bed , said the marquis .
 For three hours , the stone faces of men and lions on the chateau stared out at the night .
 All of the land was dark , and the dust settled on the quiet roads .
 It was so dark that the little heaps of poor grass in the graveyard were indistinguishable from one another , and the figure on the crucifix might have come down , since it was practically invisible in the darkness .
 In the village , the tax collectors and the people who paid the taxes were fast asleep .
 They may have been dreaming of large feasts , as starving people usually do , or of resting and living easily , as overworked slaves and oxen do .
 The thin villagers slept soundly and , in their dreams , were fed well and were free .
 The Gorgon had looked at the building again that night and had turned one more face to stone .
 The building had been waiting for this particular stone face for two hundred years .
 Drive him quickly to his tomb .
 From Jacques .
 He hadn't expected things to be easy for him in London .
 If he had , he wouldn't have done so well .
 He had expected hard work , and he found it .
 He did the work and made the best of it , and by doing this , his success continued .
 Charles Darnay .
 I'm happy to see you .
 We have been expecting you for three or four days .
 MrStryver and Sydney Carton were both here yesterday and both said you should have visited by now .
 I am thankful to them for their interest in me , he answered , a little indifferent about them but very kind to the doctor .
 Miss Manette .
 said the doctor , controlling himself .
 Bring your chair over here and tell me what it is .
 MrDarnay brought over the chair as he had been told , but he had trouble saying what he wanted to say .
 The doctor reached out his hand to stop him .
 After he had kept it there a little while , he drew back his hand and asked : 
 Is Lucie what you want to talk about .
 She is .
 It is hard for me to talk about her at any time .
 It is especially hard for me to hear you talk about her in that tone , Charles Darnay .
 I believe you .
 I trust you .
 I believe you .
 He was so restrained and so unwilling to talk about the subject that Charles Darnay hesitated .
 Shall I continue , sir .
 The doctor was silent again .
 Don't speak of that , sir .
 Leave that alone .
 I beg you , don't bring that up .
 I'm sorry , said the doctor quietly after a while .
 I don't doubt that you love Lucie .
 You should be happy about that .
 Have you spoken to Lucie about this .
 Or written to her about it .
 Never .
 It would be rude to pretend not to know that you have kept yourself away from her out of respect for me .
 I thank you .
 I believe you , her father answered sadly .
 I have thought so before now .
 I believe you .
 He placed his hand on the doctor's hand as he spoke .
 No , dear Dr .
 Manette .
 Like you , I left France by choice .
 Like you , I left to get away from the distractions , oppressions , and unhappiness .
 Like you , I worked to get away and live by my own hard work .
 I left in search of a better future , and I only want to share in your happiness , to share your life and home , and devote myself to you until death .
 I don't want to take Lucie away from you as your child and friend , but to tie her closer to you , if such a thing is possible .
 He was still holding her father's hand .
 Her father responded by placing his hands on the arms of his chair .
 He looked up at him for the first time since their conversation had started , and it was obvious that he was struggling with something .
 He struggled with that dark look that would on occasion appear on his face .
 So far , none .
 Are you hoping to find this out from this conversation .
 Not at all .
 I might not have the courage to do it for weeks .
 I might have the courage to do it tomorrow , whether it's the right time to do it or not .
 Are you looking for advice from me .
 Are you hoping for a promise from me .
 Yes , I am .
 What is it .
 I know that without you I have no hope .
 I understand that , even if Miss Manette loved me alreadydon't assume that I am conceited enough to think that she doesI could ever be loved by her if you didn't approve .
 If that is so , do you see what else is involved in it .
 I'm sure of it .
 Charles Darnay , people who are close to each other still have secrets , just as people who are far apart .
 In the first case , those secrets are subtle , delicate , and hard to penetrate .
 In this way , Lucie is a mystery to me .
 I don't know how she feels about you .
 May I ask you , sir , if you think she is as he hesitated , the doctor finished the thought for him .
 Is being courted by another man .
 That is what I meant .
 Her father thought awhile before he answered : 
 You have seen MrCarton here .
 MrStryver is here too , sometimes .
 If she is being courted , it would have to be by one of these two men .
 Or both of them , said Darnay .
 I hadn't thought of that .
 I think it's more likely that it's neither of them .
 You want me to promise you something .
 Tell me what .
 I make the promise without any condition , said the doctor .
 I believe that what you said is true .
 I believe your intention is to make the bond between my daughter and me stronger , not weaker .
 If she ever tells me that she loves you , I will give her to you .
 If there wereCharles Darnay , if there were .
 MrDarnay had taken his hand gratefully .
 They were holding hands when the doctor said : 
 any ideas , reasons , fears , anything at all , new or old against the man that she was in love withany wrongdoing that he was not directly responsible forI would forget them all for the sake of her happiness .
 She is everything to me .
 More to me than suffering , more to me than injusticeÖWell .
 This is pointless talk .
 Your confidence in me should be returned with confidence in you .
 You may remember that the name I go by now , although it is only slightly changed from my mother's , is not my own .
 I want to tell you what my name really is and why I am in England .
 said the doctor from Beauvais .
 Stop .
 Tell me when I ask you , not now .
 If you are successful and Lucie loves you , tell me the morning you get married .
 Do you promise .
 Of course .
 It was dark when Charles Darnay left , and it was darker an hour later when Lucie came home .
 She hurried into the room alone since Miss Pross had gone straight upstairs and was surprised to find the reading chair empty .
 Father .
 she called to him .
 Father dear .
 She got out of bed and went to watch him sleep that night .
 He slept heavily , and his tray of shoemaking tools and his unfinished shoes were all laid out the way they always were .
 Sydney Carton had been working twice as hard that night , and the night before .
 He had been working hard for many nights in a row , clearing out a lot of MrStryver's papers before going on a long vacation .
 The papers had finally been cleared out , and MrStryver's debts had been paid up .
 Everything was finished until November , when the weather would turn foggy , and legal matters would become complex and foggy too , and there would be work for him again .
 I am .
 Do you .
 Yes .
 And I'm not even marrying for money .
 What do you say to that .
 I don't have much to say .
 Who is she .
 Guess .
 Do I know her .
 Guess .
 And you , returned Sydney sarcastically , who was busy mixing the punch , are such a sensitive and poetic spirit .
 You're luckier , you mean .
 That's not what I mean .
 I mean I am a man of moremore .
 Say chivalry' while you're at it , suggested Carton .
 Go on , said Sydney Carton .
 It is good for a lawyer to be ashamed about something , answered Sydney .
 You should thank me .
 Sydney drank a large glass of the punch he had made and laughed .
 I've never seen you do it yet , Carton muttered to himself .
 I do it because it's smart to do it .
 I do it on principle .
 And look at me .
 I do well for myself .
 You aren't doing well with your story about your plans to marry , answered Carton casually .
 I wish you would stay on the subject .
 And back to medon't you understand that I am hopeless .
 He looked angry when he asked the question .
 You have no business being hopeless , answered Stryver harshly .
 I have no business being anything as far as I know , said Sydney Carton .
 Who is the lady .
 I did .
 You did .
 Right here in this apartment .
 Sydney Carton looked at his punch , and he looked at his satisfied friend .
 He drank his punch and looked at his friend again .
 Carton , still drinking his punch , answered Why should I be surprised .
 Do you approve .
 I'll think about it , said Sydney .
 Accordingly , MrStryver decided to begin his long vacation with a formal offer to take Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens .
 If that didn't work , he would take her to Ranelagh .
 If that failed too , he would go to her house in Soho and tell her how he felt about her there .
 Hello .
 said MrStryver .
 How do you do .
 I hope you are well .
 MrStryver's oddest characteristic was that he always appeared too big for whatever space he was in .
 He seemed so large in Tellson's that old clerks in far corners looked up in protest as though he were squeezing them against the wall .
 The head of the bank , reading a paper far away , lowered it unhappily , as if MrStryver had head-butted him in the stomach .
 Can I do anything for you , MrStryver .
 asked MrLorry in a professional way .
 Why , no , thank you .
 This is a personal visit , MrLorry .
 I have come to have a word with you in private .
 Oh dear me .
 yelled MrLorry , rubbing his chin and looking at MrStryver doubtfully .
 Oh , dear me , ' sir .
 repeated Stryver , pulling away .
 Oh , dear you , sir .
 What do you mean , MrLorry .
 MrLorry adjusted his little wig at his ears and bit the feather tip of his quill pen .
 Aren't I successful .
 asked Stryver .
 And aren't I becoming more successful .
 If the question is if you're becoming more successful , then no one can doubt that , said MrLorry , who was thrilled to be able to agree with him .
 Then what on earth do you mean , MrLorry .
 asked MrStryver , visibly hurt .
 Well .
 Iwere you on your way to Miss Manette's house right now .
 asked MrLorry .
 I'm going straight there .
 said Stryver , with a thump of his fat fist on the desk .
 I think I wouldn't do that if I were you .
 Because I wouldn't do such a thing unless I had some reason to think that I would succeed , said MrLorry .
 MrLorry looked at the head banker in the corner and looked back at MrStryver , who was now angry .
 Then what you're telling me , MrLorry , said Stryver turning toward him , is that you think Miss Manette is an idiot .
 Not exactly .
 What I mean , MrStryver , said MrLorry , who was turning red in the face , is that I will not let anyone speak badly of Miss Manette .
 If I knew any manand I hope I do notwho had such poor taste and such a bad temper that he couldn't keep himself from speaking badly of Miss Manette here at my desk , even the fact that we are in Tellson's Bank wouldn't stop me from telling him off .
 The fact that MrStryver was so angry but had to keep his voice down made his veins stand out .
 MrLorry's veins , as calm as they usually were , were just as bad now that it was his turn to speak .
 That is what I'm trying to tell you , sir , said MrLorry .
 Let's be clear about that .
 MrStryver sucked on the end of a ruler for a little while , then stood tapping the ruler against his teeth , which probably gave him a toothache .
 He broke the awkward silence by saying : 
 Are you asking me for advice , MrStryver .
 Yes , I am .
 Very good .
 Then I have given you my advice and you have repeated it correctly .
 All I can say to that , laughed Stryver , who was clearly annoyed , is that thisha , ha .
 This beats everything .
 Not I .
 said Stryver , whistling .
 I can't seem to find third parties with common sense .
 I can only find it in myself .
 I believe I have sense in certain matters .
 You believe nonsense .
 It's new to me , but I think you might be right .
 How long would I have to stay in town .
 Oh .
 Only a few hours .
 I could go to the Manette's house in Soho tonight and come to your apartment afterward .
 MrStryver was smart enough to realize that the banker wouldn't have said so much about his opinion unless he were sure of it .
 As unprepared as he was to receive MrLorry's unwanted advice , he followed it .
 And now , said MrStryver , pointing his finger and shaking it at all of Temple Bar , my way out of this is to prove you're all wrong .
 He soothed himself with a trick used by lawyers at the Old Bailey .
 You won't prove me wrong , Miss Manette , said MrStryver .
 I'll prove myself wrong .
 Well .
 said MrLorry pleasantly , after spending half an hour trying unsuccessfully to get MrStryver to bring up the subject .
 I have been to Soho .
 To Soho .
 repeated MrStryver indifferently .
 Oh , yes , of course .
 What was I thinking .
 And I'm sure , said Mrlorry , that I was right when we talked this morning .
 My opinion has been confirmed , and I repeat the same advice to you .
 I'm sorry for your sake and sorry for her father's sake , said MrStryver in his friendliest way .
 I know this must be a difficult subject for the family .
 Let's not talk about it again .
 I don't understand you , said MrLorry .
 Apparently not , he answered , nodding his head .
 It doesn't matter .
 But it does matter , MrLorry said .
 MrLorry was so surprised that he stared blankly at MrStryver as MrStryver shoved him toward the front door and pretended to be in a good mood .
 Make the best of it , my dear sir , said Stryver .
 Let's talk no more about it .
 Thanks again for allowing me to talk to get your opinion .
 Good night .
 If Sydney Carton ever made a good impression anywhere , it was certainly never at Dr .
 Manette's house .
 He had been going there regularly for a whole year , and he always spent his time there lying around in a grumpy mood .
 When he said anything , he spoke well , but his apathy cast a shadow over him , and his good heart rarely shined through .
 The servant brought him upstairs and he found Lucie working there alone .
 She had never been comfortable when he was around , and she was a little embarrassed when he arrived and sat down near her at her table .
 She looked at his face after they exchanged a few pleasantries and noticed that something was different about him .
 You look sick , MrCarton .
 No .
 But I live an unhealthy lifestyle , Miss Manette .
 What can you expect from someone as decadent as I am .
 God knows it's a shame that I don't .
 Then why not change the way you live .
 She looked at him gently again , surprised and sad to see that he was crying .
 His voice sounded sad , too , as he answered : 
 It's too late for that .
 I will never be better than I am now .
 I'll only get worse and worse .
 He leaned his elbow on the table and covered his eyes with his hand .
 The table trembled as he cried on it silently .
 She had never seen him so vulnerable , and it was upsetting to her .
 He could tell that she was upset , so without looking at her , he said : 
 Please forgive me , Miss Manette .
 I'm crying because of what I'm about to say to you .
 Will you listen to me .
 If it will make you happy , MrCarton , I would be glad to .
 God bless you for being so kind .
 After a little while he removed his hand from his face , and he spoke steadily .
 Don't be afraid to listen to me .
 Don't pull away from what I say .
 I am like someone who has died young .
 My whole life is a missed opportunity .
 No , MrCarton .
 I bet the best is still to come .
 I'm sure that you might make yourself proud .
 She was pale and shaking , and he tried to soothe her .
 He was filled with a misery and self-loathing that made the conversation unlike any other .
 Can't I help you , even though I don't love you , MrCarton .
 Forgive me , but can't I help you put your life on a better path .
 Can't I repay your trust in me .
 I know you are putting trust in me by telling me this , she said modestly after hesitating a bit , with genuine tears .
 I know that you wouldn't tell anyone else this .
 Can't I turn this into something that will help you , MrCarton .
 He shook his head .
 Nothing will come of it .
 Oh , MrCarton , think about it again .
 Try to start over .
 Since I have caused you to be more unhappy than you were before you knew me , MrCarton .
 Since the condition that you have described is partly my faultthat's what you mean , if I can say it plainlycan't I be of service to you .
 Am I not able to help you at all .
 I beg you again and again to believe that you are able to do better things with your life , MrCarton .
 Don't beg me to believe it anymore , Miss Manette .
 I know what I am .
 I'm upsetting you , so I will finish what I have to say .
 Will you let me believe , when I remember this day , that I told you the last secret of my life and that you kept it .
 And that no one will ever know about it .
 If that will bring you comfort , yes .
 Not even the person you love the most .
 MrCarton , she answered after pausing nervously , it's your secret , not mine .
 I promise to respect that and to tell no one .
 Thank you .
 And again , God bless you .
 He kissed her hand and walked toward the door .
 I will , MrCarton .
 Hooray , Father .
 cried Young Jerry .
 The boy yelled his cheer with mysterious significance .
 His father was so upset by his cheer that he waited until no one was looking and then smacked the boy on the ear .
 What do you mean .
 What are you hooraying at .
 What are you trying to tell your father , you young punk .
 This boy is too much for me .
 said MrCruncher , looking at his son .
 Him and his hoorays .
 Don't let me hear any more out of you or I'll hit you again .
 Do you hear me .
 I wasn't doing anything wrong , protested Young Jerry , rubbing his cheek .
 Stop it then , said MrCruncher .
 I don't want to hear you say you did nothing wrong .
 Get up on that stool and look at the crowd .
 What's happening , my friend .
 What's it all about .
 I don't know , said the man .
 The man went back to yelling at the coach , Spies .
 Yaha .
 Tst .
 Spies .
 He asked another man .
 Who is it .
 Was he a spy .
 asked MrCruncher .
 He was an Old Bailey spy , answered the man .
 He went on yelling at the coach , Yaha .
 Tst .
 Yah .
 Old Bailey spiiies .
 Why , of course .
 said Jerry , remembering the trial he had helped with .
 I've seen him .
 Is he dead .
 Thus the procession continued down the street , with the crowd drinking beer , smoking pipes , singing songs , and some people doing mocking impressions of people in mourning .
 More and more people joined the mob as it went , and all the shops closed as it approached .
 It was heading for the old church of Saint Pancras , far off in the country .
 Eventually it arrived there , and the crowd insisted on all going into the burial ground .
 There they finally buried the dead Roger Cly as they wanted , and to their great satisfaction .
 MrCruncher didn't take part in the final events , but had stayed at the churchyard to talk with the undertakers .
 The churchyard was calming to him .
 He got a pipe from a nearby pub and smoked it as he looked at the fences and thoughtfully considered the graveyard .
 Young Jerry had covered for his father in his absence and told him that there had been no work while he was gone .
 The bank closed , the old clerks came out , the watchmen took their place , and MrCruncher and his son went home to tea .
 The unhappy MrsCruncher shook her head .
 Why , you're doing it in front of my face .
 said MrCruncher , angry and anxious .
 I'm not saying anything .
 Yes , Jerry , said his wife .
 MrCruncher didn't mean anything particular with these words , but he used them sarcastically , as people often do , to express unhappiness .
 You're going out tonight .
 asked his decent wife after he had taken another bite .
 Yes , I am .
 Can I go with you , Father .
 asked his son quickly .
 No , you can't .
 I'm going fishing , as your mother knows .
 That's where I'm going .
 I'm going fishing .
 Never mind that .
 Are you going to bring any fish home , Father .
 If I don't , you'll have very little food tomorrow , answered his father , shaking his head .
 That's enough questions from you .
 I'm not going out until you've been in bed for a long time .
 And remember .
 said MrCruncher .
 Don't play around tomorrow .
 If I , an honest businessman , am able to put a joint of meat on the table , you won't decide to not eat it and only eat bread .
 And if I , an honest businessman , am able to get a little bit of beer , you won't decide to only drink water .
 When in Rome , do as the Romans do .
 Rome will treat you poorly if you don't .
 I am your Rome , you know .
 Then he began mumbling again : 
 I told you I would , said MrCruncher , and I did .
 Jerry , Jerry , Jerry .
 his wife begged .
 You pray that I'll fail in my business dealings , said Jerry , and then my partners and I suffer .
 You're supposed to honor and obey your husband .
 Why the devil won't you .
 I try to be a good wife , Jerry , the poor woman argued , crying .
 Is it being a good wife to sabotage your husband's business .
 Is it honoring your husband to dishonor his business .
 Is it obeying your husband to disobey him on the important subject of his work .
 You hadn't started this terrible work back when I made those vows , Jerry .
 They argued quietly , until MrCruncher kicked off his clay-covered boots and lied down on the floor .
 After taking a nervous peek at him lying on his back , with his rust-covered hands under his head for a pillow , Young Jerry lay down too and fell asleep again .
 There was no fish for breakfast , or much of anything else .
 MrCruncher was in a bad mood , and he kept an iron pot lid near him in case he saw MrsCruncher saying grace and wanted to throw it at her .
 He brushed his hair and washed up at the usual time and went off to work with his son .
 I thought you knew everything , Father , said Young Jerry pretending unconvincingly .
 What merchandise does he trade in , Father .
 asked the quick Young Jerry .
 His merchandise , said MrCruncher after thinking it over , is of a scientific kind .
 People's bodies , isn't it , Father .
 asked the boy , excited .
 I think it's something like that , said MrCruncher .
 Oh , Father , I want to be a resurrection man when I grow up .
 People had started drinking earlier than usual at Monsieur Defarge's wine shop .
 As early as six o'clock in the morning , sickly faces looking into the shop's barred windows had seen the faces of other people inside , hunched over their wine glasses .
 Monsieur Defarge sold very weak wine even when things were going well , but nowadays his wine was especially weak .
 Moreover , his wine tasted sour and made the people who drank it sour and depressed .
 Monsieur Defarge's wine didn't fire them with a Bacchanalian Bacchus was the Roman god of wine Bacchanalian flame , but instead filled them with a low , intense heat .
 Good day , gentlemen .
 said Monsieur Defarge .
 Saying this may have been a signal to let everyone know they could speak .
 Together everyone answered , Good day .
 The weather is bad , gentlemen , said Defarge , shaking his head .
 When he said this , all the men looked at each other , then they looked at the ground and sat in silence .
 Except for one man , who got up and left .
 Have you finished your meal , my friend .
 asked Monsieur Defarge after a while .
 Yes , thank you .
 Come on , then .
 I'll show you the apartment I said you could stay in .
 It's perfect for you .
 Defarge carefully closed the door and said quietly : 
 Jacques One , Jacques Two , Jacques Three .
 This is the witness that I , Jacques Four , went to meet .
 He will tell you everything .
 Tell them , Jacques Five .
 The repairer of roads wiped his dark brow with his blue cap and said , Where should I begin , monsieur .
 Begin at the beginning , was Monsieur Defarge's sensible reply .
 The repairer of roads acted it all out again .
 He ought to have perfected his act by then , since he had been entertaining his village with it for the whole year .
 Jacques One jumped in and asked if he had ever seen the man before .
 Never , answered the repairer of roads , standing up straight again .
 Jacques Three wanted to know how he was able to recognize him if he had never seen him before .
 You should have said as short as a dwarf , answered Jacques Two .
 He's right there , Jacques , mumbled Defarge to the man who had interrupted .
 Go on .
 The number of months doesn't matter , said Defarge .
 He is well hidden , but unfortunately he's finally been found .
 Go on .
 With the help of his cap , he showed them how the man had his elbows bound to his sides with a rope that was tied behind him .
 He described it as if he were there , and it was obvious that he saw it all clearly .
 Perhaps he hadn't seen much else excitement in his life .
 I didn't let the soldiers see that I recognized the tall man , and he didn't let them see that he recognized me .
 We did all of it with our eyes .
 ëCome on .
 ' said the leader of the group , pointing to the village .
 ëBring him quickly to his grave .
 ' At that , they started walking faster .
 I followed .
 His arms were swollen from being tied up so tightly , and his wooden shoes were large and awkward .
 He was limping , walking slowly because of this , and the soldiers were prodding him forward with their gunslike this .
 He showed them how the man was pushed forward by the butt ends of the muskets .
 As they went down the hill like mad men running a race , the tall man fell .
 The soldiers laughed and picked him up again .
 His face was bleeding and covered with dust , but he couldn't touch it .
 So they laughed at him again .
 They brought him to the village , and all the villagers came running to look at him .
 The soldiers took him past the mill and up to the prison .
 All the villagers watched the prison gate open in the darkness of the night and the tall man go inside .
 It looked like the prison gate swallowed himlike this .
 He opened his mouth wide and then shut it quickly , making a snapping sound with his teeth .
 Seeing that the man didn't want to ruin the effect by opening his mouth again , Defarge said , Go on , Jacques .
 Go on , Jacques , said Defarge .
 Listen then , Jacques , Jacques One interrupted sternly .
 Know that a petition was presented to the king and queen .
 Everyone here , except you , saw the king take it while he was in his carriage in the street , sitting next to the queen .
 It was Defarge , this man here , who , risking his life , ran out in front of the horses with the petition in his hand .
 And listen again , Jacques , said Jacques Three , who was kneeling down .
 He kept running his fingers over his face in a noticeably greedy way , as if hungry for something besides food and drink .
 The guards , on horse and on foot , surrounded Defarge as he presented the petition and beat him .
 Understand .
 I understand , messieurs .
 Go on then , said Defarge .
 I'm thirty-five , said the repairer of roads , who looked sixty .
 It was done when you were over ten years old .
 Maybe you saw it .
 Enough .
 said Defarge impatiently .
 Long live the devil .
 Continue .
 It's terrible , messieurs .
 How can women and children fetch water from the fountain .
 Who can gather and gossip there now that a man has been killed there .
 When I left the village Monday evening , as the sun was setting , I looked back from the hill and the shadow of the man hanging from the gallows fell across the church , the mill , and the prison .
 It seemed to fall across the whole world , messieurs .
 The greedy man chewed on one of his fingers as he looked at the other three , and his finger shook with a hunger for something other than food .
 That's all , messieurs .
 I left at sunset as I had been told to do , and I walked the rest of the night and half of the next day until I met this man here , as I was told .
 I came with him , sometimes riding a horse and sometimes walking , through the rest of yesterday and last night .
 And here I am .
 After a gloomy silence , Jacques One said , Good .
 You have done the right thing and have told your story well .
 Will you wait for us a little while outside .
 Of course , said the repairer of roads .
 Defarge brought him to the top of the stairs , left him sitting there , and came back .
 The three men had gotten up and were standing together when Defarge came back into the attic .
 What do you say , Jacques .
 asked Jacques One .
 Should we put them on the list .
 To be put on the list and destroyed , answered Defarge .
 Wonderful .
 said the greedy man .
 The chateau and the whole family .
 asked Jacques One .
 The chateau and the whole family , answered Defarge .
 Extermination .
 The hungry man said Wonderful .
 again and began chewing another finger .
 He doesn't know anything , said Defarge .
 At least nothing more than what would get him hanged , too .
 I'll take responsibility for him .
 Let him stay with me .
 I'll take care of him and then send him on his way .
 He wants to see the world of the upper classes : the king , the queen , and the court .
 Let him see them on Sunday .
 What .
 shouted the hungry man , staring at him .
 Isn't it a bad sign that he wants to see royalty and nobility .
 Jacques , said Defarge .
 Show a cat just a little bit of milk if you want it to thirst for it .
 Show a dog his natural prey if you want it to hunt it one day .
 Worse places than Defarge's wine shop could easily be found in Paris for an unsophisticated peasant like him .
 Except for a mysterious fear of Madame Defarge that bothered him constantly , his life was new and exciting .
 But Madame Defarge sat at the counter all day , ignoring him and determined not to show that his being had any connection to a secret plan .
 He trembled in his wooden shoes whenever he looked at her and told himself that it was impossible to know what the lady might pretend next .
 He was sure that if she decided to pretend that she had seen him kill someone and then skin the victim afterward , she would continue with the idea until he had been convicted of murder .
 Therefore , when Sunday came , the repairer of roads was not happy , although he claimed he was , to find out that Madame Defarge was to go with Defarge and himself to Versailles .
 It was additionally worrisome to have Madame Defarge knitting the whole way there on public transportation .
 It was also worrisome to have her in the crowd that afternoon still holding her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to see the carriage of the king and queen .
 You work hard , madame , said the man next to her in the crowd .
 Yes , answered Madame Defarge .
 I have a lot of work to do .
 What do you make , madame .
