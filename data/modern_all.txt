It was one of the best and worst times in history. It was a time of greatintelligence and ignorance, belief and disbelief, good and evil, hope andhopelessness. We had everything to live for, and we had nothing to live for.Everyone was going straight to Heaven and straight to hell. Basically, it wasjust like the present1859, the time at which Dickens was writingthe present, with experts of the time insisting on seeing its events only interms of contrasting extremes.            

A stern-looking king and a plain-looking queen ruled England. A stern-lookingking and a beautiful queen ruled France. In both countries, it seemed obvious tothe people managing the royal food supplies that things were stable and nothingwould ever change.             

It was 1775. People in England were as superstitious then as theyare now. Mrs. Southcotta woman who claimed to be a prophetMrs. Southcott had just turned twenty-five, and a private in the British army who claimed he could tell the future announced her appearance by saying that London and Westminster would be destroyed.Even the Cock Lane Ghostthe ghost of a woman believed to haunt a house on Cock LaneCock Lane Ghost had only been gone twelve years since last tapping out its messages, as the very unoriginal ghosts of last year tapped outtheirs. A group of British subjects in the American coloniesthe First Continental Congressgroup of British subjects in the American colonies hadrecently sent messages to the King of England, and oddly enough, these earthly messages proved more important than any of the supernatural ones from Cock Lane.            

France, which was less interested in spiritual matters than England, washeaded straight toward disaster, printing lots of paper money and spending allof it. Under the leadership of the clergy, the French government entertaineditself with such activities as cutting off a young manís hands, pulling histongue out with pliers, and burning him alive. The French government did thisbecause the man didnít kneel down in the rain to pay tribute to a group of dirtymonks walking by fifty or sixty yards away. While this young man was being putto death, trees were growing in the forests of France and Norway that Fate haddecided would one day be used to make the guillotines that would play a terriblerole in history. Itís likely too that on the crude farms near Paris sat rough,filthy carts, which pigs snuffed around and poultry roosted in, that Death haddecided would be used during the Revolution to cart people to the guillotine.Though Fate and Death work constantly, they also work quietly, so no one heardthem as they went sneaking around. Instead, if a person even suggested that badtimes were on the way, he would be accused of being an atheist and a traitor.        

England didnít have much law and order to brag about, either. Even in London,armed bandits broke into peopleís houses and travelers were robbed on thehighways every night. Families were warned to lock their furniture away instorehouses before leaving town. The man who was a highway robber at night was abusinessman during the day, and when the man he robbed recognized and confrontedhim, the robber shot him in the head and rode away. Seven robbers once attackeda mail coach, and a policeman shot three of them dead. But he was then shot bythe other four when his weapon failed to go off. After that, the robbers wereable to rob the coach without being disturbed. Even our fearless leader, themayor of London, was attacked in front of his whole entourage by a singlehighway robber. In the London jails, prisoners fought with their guards, and theguards opened fire on the prisoners. Thieves stole necklaces with diamondcrosses off the necks of lords at court. Soldiers entered the St. Giles houselooking for stolen goods, and the mob opened fire on them, so they fired back,and no one thought any of these events the least bit unusual. During all ofthis, the executioner was in constant demand, despite being terrible at his job.He would hang a burglar on a Saturday who had only been arrested that Tuesday.He would brand dozens of peopleís hands at Newgate and then burn controversialpamphlets in front of Westminster Hall. One day he might execute a terriblemurderer, and the next day he would execute a poor thief who had stolen a fewpennies from a farmerís son.             

All of these events, and a thousand others like them, happened in and aroundthe year 1775. In this atmosphere, with Death and Fate working quietly, thosestern-looking kings and plain and beautiful queens of England and France carriedon confidently, ruling by their divine right with a high hand. Through it all,Fate and Death worked without impediment. And so, in 1775, these two royalcouples, and many of their citizens whose stories are told in this book, headedtoward their destinies.             

This story starts with a man traveling along the road to Dover on a Fridaynight in late November. The Dover mail coach was also on the road and was movingslowly up Shooterís Hill. The man walked up the hill in the mud next to the mailcoach, as did the rest of the coachís passengers. The passengers werenít walkingbecause they wanted exercise; they were walking because the hill, the harness,the mud, and the weight of the mail made the coach so heavy that the horsespulling it had already stopped three times. The horses had even tried to turnaround and drag the coach back to Blackheath, an act equivalent to mutiny. Thecoachman and the guard, however, refusing to allow such behvior, whipped thehorses with the reins and persuaded them to continue on.             

With their heads bowed down and their tails shaking, the horses stomped theirway through the thick mud, struggling and tripping as if they were coming apartat their joints. Whenever the coachman stopped them, yelling ìWo-ho!so-ho-then!î the lead horse would violently shake his head, as if he were tryingto tell the driver that the coach would never make it. Each time the lead horseshook like this, one of the nervous passengers would jump, and feeluneasy.            

A steam-like mist moved gloomily up the hill, like a ghost looking for a placeto rest, but finding none. The mist was cold and damp, and it moved slowlythrough the air in ripples that flowed on top of one another like the waves of arough sea. It was so thick that all that could be seen by the light of the coachlamps was the mist itself and a few yards of the road. Steam rose off thestruggling horses and mixed with the mist, as if the mist were coming from thehorses themselves.             

The two other passengers, beside the one already mentioned, were also ploddingtheir way up the hill beside the mail coach. All three men were bundled up allthe way to their ears and wore high boots. They were so covered up that not oneof them could say what the others looked like, and all were so secretive thattheir minds were just as hidden as their faces. In those days, travelers kept tothemselves, because anyone on the road could be a robber or in league withrobbers. Every inn and alehouse had someone in it working for thieves, from thelandlord down to the lowliest stable boyóanyone could be a criminal. This iswhat the guard of the Dover mail coach thought to himself that Friday night inNovember 1775, as the mail coach lumbered up Shooterís Hill and the guard stoodat his place on the back, stomping his feet and staying close to the chest ofweapons. In the chest was a loaded blunderbussan early form of shotgun with a short barrelblunderbuss, six or eight handguns, and a layer ofswords at the bottom.             

The mood in the Dover mail coach was friendly as usual: the guard suspectedthe passengers, the passengers suspected each other and the guard, everyone wassuspicious of everyone else, and the driver trusted no one but the horses,though he would have sworn on the Bible that they were not strong enough to makethe trip.            

ìWo-ho!î shouted the driver to the horses. ìOne more tug and youíll be at thetop of the hill, and damn you for all the trouble it took to get you there!Joe!î            

ìHello!î the guard replied.            

ìWhat time do you think it is, Joe?î            

ìTen minutes past eleven.î            

ìAnd weíre not to the top of Shooterís Hill yet!î yelled the angry driver.ìYah! Get a move on!î             

The driver struck the lead horse with his whip, and the horse made a strongpush up the hill as the other horses followed. The Dover mail coach pushed ononce again, with the high boots of the passengers squashing through the mud nextto it. When the coach stopped, the passengers stopped and stayed close besideit. If any of them had been brave enough to suggest they walk ahead into themist and darkness, one of the others would have suspected him of being a highwayrobber and shot him.             

The last push moved the mail coach to the top of the hill. The horses stoppedto catch their breath. The guard got down to set the brake for the descent downthe hill, and to open the coach door to let the passengers in.             

ìHey, Joe!î yelled the driver in a warning voice, looking down from the top ofthe coach.             

ìWhat is it, Tom?î            

They both listened.             

ìSounds like a horse trotting toward us, Joe.î            

ìIíd say that horse is moving faster than that, Tom,î replied the guard. Helet go of the door and jumped back to his place on the coach. ìGentlemen, in thename of the king, get back in the coach!î            

With this hurried command, he cocked the gun, and stood ready to fire.            

The passenger followed throughout this book was on the coach step getting in.The other two passengers were right behind him, about to follow. He remained onthe step, half in the coach and half out. They all looked back and forth betweenthe driver and the guard, listening. The driver and the guard looked back at thepassengers, and even the lead horse listened and looked back at them.             

It became very quiet once the rumbling and struggling of the mail coach hadstopped, adding to the stillness of the night. The panting of the horses madethe mail coach shake as if it, too, were nervous. The passengersí hearts beat soloudly it was as if they could be heard outside their bodies. But the quietnessreflected the emotions of the passengers, who were out of breath, and holdingtheir breath, their heartbeats speeding up in expectation.            

The sound of a horse running came quickly and furiously up the hill.            

ìHalt!î yelled the guard as loud as he could. ìYou there! Stop or Iíllshoot!î            

The horse suddenly slowed with a lot of splashing and stumbling. A manís voicecalled from the mist, ìIs that the Dover mail coach?î            

ìNever mind what it is!î answered the guard. ìWho are you?î            

ìIs that the Dover mail coach?î            

ìWhy do you want to know?î            

ìIf it is, Iím looking for one of the passengers.î            

ìWhich passenger?î            

ìMr. Jarvis Lorry.î            

Our character said that he was Mr. Jarvis Lorry. The guard, the driver, andthe two other passengers looked at him distrustfully.            

ìStay where you are,î the guard yelled to the man in the mist. ìI donít wantto make a mistake and shoot you. The man named Lorry, speak up!î            

ìWhatís the matter?î asked the passenger, in a slightly trembling voice.ìWhoís looking for me? Is it Jerry?î            

ìIf that is Jerry, I donít like the sound of his voice,î the guard muttered tohimself. ìItís scratchier than Iíd care for.î            

ìYes, Mr. Lorry.î            

ìWhatís the matter?î            

ìI have a letter for you from T. and Company.î            

ìI know this messenger, guard,î said Mr. Lorry, exiting the coach onto theroad. The other two passengers helped him from behind, though not very politely,then immediately climbed into the coach, shut the door, and closed the window.ìHe can come close. Thereís nothing to worry about.î            

ìI hope not, but I canít be sure of that,î grumbled the guard to himself.ìHey, you!î he said to Jerry.            

ìHey to you!î said Jerry, raspier than before.            

ìCome over slowly, do you hear me? And if youíve got gun holsters on yoursaddle, donít let me see your hands go near them. Iím quick to make a mistake,and my mistakes usually involve bullets. Let me see you.î            

The figures of a horse and rider came slowly out of the swirling mist and overto the side of the mail coach, where the passenger was standing. The rider bentdown, and keeping an eye on the guard, handed the passenger a small folded pieceof paper. The riderís horse was exhausted, and both the horse and rider werecovered in mud, from the hoofs of the horse to the riderís hat.            

ìGuard!î said the passenger in a confidential tone.             

The guard stood ready, his right hand on the handle of the blunderbuss and hisleft on the barrel. His eyes were on the horseman, and he answered curtly,ìSir.î             

ìThereís nothing to worry about. I work at Tellsonís Bank. You must knowTellsonís Bank in London. Iím going to Paris on business. Iíll give you money tobuy yourself a drink. Will you let me read this?î            

ìIf you do it quickly, sir.î            

He opened it in the light of the coach lamp, and read it to himself first andthen aloud: ìëWait at Dover for Mademoiselle.í Itís a short message, you see,guard. Jerry, tell them my answer was ëBrought back to life.íî            

Jerry jumped in his saddle. ìThatís a very strange answer,î he said, raspierthan ever.            

ìGive them that reply and they will know that I understood their message as ifIíd written it myself. Have a good trip back. Good night.î            

With that, Mr. Lorry opened the coach door and got in. He wasnít helped by theother passengers, who had quietly hidden their watches and purses in their bootsand were pretending to be asleep. They wanted only to avoid trouble.            

The mail coach pushed on again, with a heavier mist closing round it as itbegan to move down the hill. The guard soon put his blunderbuss back inside thechest and checked on the rest of the weapons. Having done that, he checked onthe extra pistols he wore on his belt, and then checked on the smaller chestunder his seat, in which he kept some blacksmithing tools, a couple of torches,and a box of kindling for starting fires. The guard was so well prepared that ifthe coach lamps went out, which happened sometimes, he could easily light themagain from inside the coach within five minutes (if he were lucky).            

ìTom!î said Joe quietly over the top of the coach.            

ìYeah, Joe.î            

ìDid you hear that message?î            

ìI did, Joe.î            

ìWhat do you think it meant, Tom?î            

ìNothing, Joe.î            

ìThatís a coincidence,î Joe said, ìI thought the same thing myself.î            

Jerry, left alone in the dark mist, got down to give his tired horse a rest,wipe the mud off his face, and shake the water from his wide hat brim, whichcould probably hold half a gallon. He waited there with his bridle on his wet,muddy arm until he could no longer hear the wheels of the mail coach and thenight was still again. Then he turned to walk down the hill.            

ìAfter galloping all the way from Temple Bar, old lady, I wonít ride you againuntil we get to level ground,î said the raspy-voiced messenger, looking at hishorse. ìëBrought back to life.í Thatís a very strange message. You wouldnít likethat, Jerry. Youíd be in trouble if dead people started coming back tolife!î            

Itís amazing to think that every human being is a complete mystery to everyother human being. When I enter a big city at night, I think how every one ofthe houses clustered together in the dark holds its own secret inside; and everyroom in every house has its own secret; and every one of the thousands of peoplein the city keeps a secret from those closest to him. In a way itís like death.When I am dead I can no longer turn the pages of lifeís book, and vainly hope toread all of it. I wonít be able to look at the mysteries of life, and catchglimpses of hidden truths. Life ends in an instant, when Iíve only begun toexperience it. It ends with its mysteries forever unsolved, leaving me withoutanswers. The same is true of my friend, neighbor, or dearest love, all of whomwill die. Death turns the secrets each individual carries into permanentmysteries, just as my secrets will never come out once Iíve died. Are the deadin Londonís graveyards more mysterious to me than its living inhabitants are, oram I as much of a mystery to those inhabitants myself?            

In a way, our secrets make us all equals. Jerry, the messenger, possessed asmany secrets as the king, or the first minister of state, or the richestbusinessman in London. The same is true of the three passengers closed up in thelumbering old mail coach. They were all mysteries to each other, as unknown toeach other as if they had each been in different coaches, traveling incompletely different places.             

The messenger rode slowly back, stopping often at alehouses along the way todrink, but keeping to himself, with his hat angled over his eyes. His eyes,which fit him well, were solid black and much too close together, as if each eyefeared being caught at something if it were too far from the other. They peeredout menacingly from under his old hat, which was pulled down low and looked likea three-sided spittoona receptacle for tobacco chewers to spit intothree-sided spittoon. And they looked out over the large scarf that covered his chin and throatand went down nearly to his knees. When he stopped for a drink, he would removethe scarf with his left hand while he drank with his right, and as soon as hewas done, he would cover his face again.             

ìNo, Jerry, no!î the messenger repeated to himself as he traveled. ìThatwouldnít do, Jerry. Youíre an honest worker. It wouldnít suit your type ofbusiness! Brought backó! He must have been drunk!î            

He was so confused by the message that he kept taking off his hat to scratchhis head. Except on the very top of his head, which was bald, he had stiff,black hair that stuck up in spikes all over his head and grew almost down to hislarge, wide nose. His hair looked so much like metal spikes that the worldísbest leapfrog players might have refused to jump over him, thinking it toodangerous.             

He rode back with the message, which he was to deliver to the night watchmanat the door of Tellsonís Bank, next to Temple Bar. The watchman was to deliverit to important people inside. While the messenger rode, the shadows of thenight seemed to take the form of the dead returning to life, like the messagehad said. His horse also saw shapes in the darkness arising out of her privatefears. Those fears must have been numerous, for she jumped at every shadow onthe road.            

The mail coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, and bumped along slowly, with itsthree passengers inside. They must have also seen shapes in the forms as theydozed off and let their thoughts wander.            

A great number of customers withdrew their money from Tellsonís Bank throughthe mail carried by the mail coach. As Mr. Lorry nodded off, with his armthrough a leather strap to keep him from banging against the passenger besidehim and pushing him into the corner, he dreamed the mail coach was the bankitself on a busy day. The sound of the rattling harness became the jingle ofcoins, and more checks were cashed in five minutes than Tellsonís, with its manylocal and foreign clients, had cashed in three times that period. He dreamt thatthe bank vaults under Tellsonís, with all of their valuables and secrets (and heknew plenty about them), opened up in front of him. He walked through them withhis large keys and a dim candle and found everything safe and sound, just as hehad left it.             

Although he thought constantly of the bank, and although he remained vaguelyaware that he was still in the coach (the way you are only vaguely aware of painwhen on a pain-killer), another thought ran through his mind all night. He hadthe feeling that he was on his way to dig someone out of a grave.            

Now, although several faces appeared in front of him in the night, he couldnítdetermine which was the face of the buried person. All the faces belonged to aforty-five-year-old man, but they all differed in the expression they wore, andin how worn-out they looked. One facial expression followed another: pride,contempt, defiance, stubbornness, submission, and lamentation. Some had sunkencheeks, sickly pale skin, hands and bodies that had wasted away. But it wasalmost always the same face, and every head of hair had gone prematurely white.In his dream, Mr. Lorry asked the ghostly figure a hundred times:            

ìHow long had you been buried?î            

The answer was always the same: ìAlmost eighteen years.î            

ìHad you given up hope of being dug up?î            

ìYes, a long time ago.î            

ìDo you know that youíve been brought back to life?î            

ìThatís what they tell me.î            

ìYou want to live, donít you?î            

ìI donít know.î            

ìShould I show her to you? Will you come see her?î            

The ghostly figured answered this question in different and contradictoryways. Sometimes he answered weakly: ìWait! I would die if I saw her too soon.îSometimes he cried tenderly and said, ìTake me to her.î Sometimes he becameconfused and answered, ìI donít know her. I donít understand.î            

After these imaginary conversations, Mr. Lorry would dream that he was diggingthe man outósometimes with a spade, sometimes a shovel, and sometimes his hands.Once the man was dug out, with dirt clinging to his face and hair, he wouldsuddenly turn to dust. This would startle Mr. Lorry and wake him. He would openthe window to allow the feeling of mist and rain on his face to bring him backto reality.             

But even when Mr. Lorry was fully awake, looking at the mist and rain, thelight from the lamps, the hedge passing by at the roadside, the shadows outsidethe coach would blend together with the shadows within. The real bank at TempleBar, the real business of the day before, the real bank vaults, the real messagehe had received, and the real message he sent back would still be there. But theghostly face would rise up and appear to him again.            

ìHow long have you been buried?î            

ìAlmost eighteen years.î            

ìYou want to live, donít you?î            

ìI donít know.î            

In his dream, Mr. Lorry would continue to dig until one of the other twopassengers would wake him and tell him to close the window. Then he would puthis arm securely through the leather strap and think about the two sleepingpassengers, until he fell back asleep and began once again to dream about thebank and the grave.             

ìHow long had you been buried?î            

ìAlmost eighteen years.î            

ìHad you given up all hope of being dug out?î            

ìYes, a long time ago.î            

Mr. Lorry could still hear those words, as clearly as if they had just beenspoken in real life, when he woke to realize it was daylight, and the shadows ofthe night were all gone.             

He opened the window and looked out at the rising sun. He saw a field, with aplow sitting where it had been left the night before when the horses were untiedfrom it. Further in the distance, he saw a quiet forest, where the bright redand golden yellow leaves remained on the trees. Though the ground was cold andwet, the sky was clear and the sun rose, bright, calm, and beautiful.            

ìEighteen years!î said the passenger, looking at the sun. ìGood God! Imaginebeing buried alive for eighteen years!î            

When the coach reached Dover late in the morning, the head attendant at theRoyal George Hotel opened the coach door. He did it with a grand gesture,because a trip from London to Dover during the winter was difficult, and makingthe journey was an achievement worth congratulating.            

By that time, there was only one passenger to congratulate. The other two hadgotten out at their destinations. The mildewy interior of the coach, with itsdamp and dirty straw, its unpleasant smell, and its darkness, was like theinside of a large dog cage. Mr. Lorry, shaking off the straw and dressed in hisshaggy coat, floppy hat, and with his legs covered in mud, looked like a largedog himself.             

ìWill there be a mail boat to Calais tomorrow, attendant?î            

ìYes, sir, if we still have good weather and the wind is decent. The tide willbe good for setting out at about two in the afternoon, sir. Would you like abed, sir?î            

ìI wonít go to bed until tonight, but I would like a bedroom and abarber.î            

ìAnd then breakfast, sir? Yes, sir. This way, sir, please. Staff! Show him tothe Concord room! Bring the gentlemanís suitcase and some hot water. Pull offthe gentlemanís boots. (You will find a nice coal fire there, sir.) Bring thebarber! Get going!î             

The Concord room was always given to passengers from the mail coach, and thesepassengers were always heavily bundled up when they entered. For this reason,the room was a bit of a curiosity: everyone who went in looked the same, butwhen they came out they all looked different. This is why a steward, twoporters, several maids, and the landlady all happened to be standing aroundbetween the Concord room and the coffee room, when a sixty-year-old gentleman,dressed up in a worn but tidy brown suit with large cuffs and flaps on hispockets, passed by on his way to breakfast.            

The gentleman in the brown suit was the only person in the coffee room thatmorning. His table was near the fire, and he sat so still as he waited for hisfood that, with the firelight on him, he looked as though he was having hisportrait painted.            

He looked very neat, with a hand resting on each knee, and his watch tickingloudly and seriously under his flapped waistcoat, contrasting with the playfulflickering of the fire. He was proud of his legs and wore thin, tight brownstockings to show them off. His shoes and shoe buckles, though plain, werewell-kept. He wore a strange shiny blond wig that sat tightly on his head. Thewig looked like it was made from strands of silk or glass rather than from hair.His clothes, though not as nice as his stockings, were as white as the tops ofthe waves that broke on the beach nearby, or the sails of boats glinting in thesun far out at sea. His face was calm and reserved, but his moist, bright eyestwinkled from under his wig. It must have been hard for him to train his brighteyes to take on the dull expression of the employees of Tellsonís Bank. Hischeeks were a healthy color, and though his face had some wrinkles, it showedfew signs of anxiety. Perhaps the clerks at Tellsonís Bank were mainly concernedwith other peopleís problems, and maybe other peopleís problems, like secondhandclothes, are easy to put on and take off.             

Completing his resemblance to a man having his portrait painted, Mr. Lorryfell asleep. The arrival of his breakfast woke him, and he said to theattendant, as he moved his chair up to the table:             

ìI would like you to get a room ready for a young woman who may arrive here atany time today. She may ask for Mr. Jarvis Lorry, or she may just ask for agentleman from Tellsonís Bank. Please let me know when she arrives.î            

ìYes, sir. Tellsonís Bank in London, sir?î            

ìYes.î            

ìYes, sir. We often have the honor of hosting you gentlemen as you travelbetween London and Paris, sir. Tellson and Company employees travel a greatdeal, sir.î            

ìYes. We are very much a French business, as well as an English one.î            

ìYes, sir. You donít frequently do the traveling yourself, do you sir?î            

ìNot in recent years. Itís been fifteen years since weósince Iólast came backfrom France.î            

ìReally, sir? That was before I worked here, sir. Before the new owners boughtthis place, sir. The George Hotel was owned by other people back then,sir.î            

ìI believe it was.î            

ìBut I would bet, sir, that a bank like Tellson and Company was thrivingfifty, not to mention fifteen, years ago?î            

ìYou could triple that and say a hundred and fifty.î            

ìReally, sir!î            

The waiter opened wide his mouth and eyes as he stepped back from the table.He moved his napkin from his right arm to his left, shifted into a casualstance, and stood watching while Mr. Lorry ate and drank. The waiter watched asthough looking from a watchtower, as waiters have always done.            

When Mr. Lorry had finished breakfast, he went out for a stroll on the beach.The cramped, crooked town of Dover couldnít be seen from the beach, as though itwere hiding, and it extended all the way to the chalk cliffs. The sea tossedstones wildly about on the beach. It did what it liked, and what it liked wasdestruction. It threatened the town by crashing angrily against the cliffs. Theair around the houses had such a fishy smell that one might have thought sickfish went to the water to dip themselves in it, just as sick people sometimesdo. Not much fishing was done in the port, but suspicious-looking people were always wandering along the water at nightDover was known as a smuggling portsuspicious-looking people were always wandering along the water at night, particularly at high tide.Small businessmen who didnít work at all sometimes mysteriously came upon largefortunes for no apparent reason, and for some strange reason, nobody couldtolerate the lamps being lit at night.            

As afternoon came on, the air, which at times was clear enough that one couldsee the French coast, clouded over with mist and fog. Mr. Lorryís mood seemed tocloud over as well. When it got dark, he sat in front of the coffee-room fire,awaiting his dinner just as he had awaited his breakfast. He imagined he wasdigging again as he stared into the red coals of the fire.            

Mr. Lorry drank a bottle of good red wine after dinner, causing him to loseinterest in work. He had been sitting there for a long time and had just pouredout his last glassful of wineówith as happy an expression as any elderlygentleman can have after drinking most of a bottleówhen he heard the rattling ofwheels coming up the street and pulling into the innís yard.            

He put down his glass without drinking. ìMademoiselle is here!î hesaid.            

In just a few minutes the waiter came in to tell him that Miss Manette hadarrived from London and would be happy to see him.            

ìSo soon?î            

Miss Manette had had some food and drink on the journey and didnít needanymore when she arrived. She was extremely anxious to see Mr. Lorryimmediately, if he was ready to meet with her.            

Mr. Lorry tossed back the rest of his wine with an air of calm desperation,straightened his odd little wig over his ears, and followed the waiter to MissManetteís room. The room was large and dark, and it was furnished like a funeralparlor with black horsehair furniture and heavy, dark tables. These tables hadbeen oiled repeatedly, so that the two tall candles on the table in the middleof the room were gloomily reflected in the oiled surface. The reflections madeit look like the candles themselves were buried deep in graves of blackmahogany, and they would give off no light until they were dug out.            

The room was so dark that, as Mr. Lorry carefully crossed the worn Turkishcarpet, he thought for a moment that Miss Manette was in a different room. Thenhe moved past the two tall candles and saw a young lady standing to meet himbetween the table and the fire. She was no older than seventeen and wore ariding cloak. She was still holding her straw traveling hat by its ribbon. Helooked at her short, thin, pretty figure, her golden blonde hair, her curiousblue eyes, and her young, smooth forehead, which had a habit of wrinkling up inan expression that looked like a mixture of confusion, wonder, fear, and keenawareness. As he looked at her, she suddenly reminded him of a child he had heldin his arms on a journey across the Channel separating England and France, on acold day when it was hailing heavily and the sea was high. The similarity passedquickly, like steam breathed on the mirror behind her would pass quickly. On theframe of that mirror behind her, figurines of black cupids, broken and headless,held out baskets of fruit to black goddesses. Mr. Lorry bowed formally to MissManette.            

ìPlease, sit down, sir,î she said, in a very clear and pleasant young voicewith a very slight foreign accent.            

ìI kiss your hand, miss,î said Mr. Lorry, in a slightly old-fashioned manner,as he bowed formally again and sat down.            

ìI received a letter from the bank, sir, yesterday, telling me about someinformationóor discoveryóî            

ìThe word isnít important, miss, either one will do.î            

ìóregarding what little property my poor father owned. I never met him. He hasbeen dead so longÖî            

Mr. Lorry moved in his seat and looked uneasily at the line of black cupids,as if they could help anyone!            

ìÖmaking it necessary that I travel to Paris to meet with a gentleman from thebank, who would be sent there to meet with me.î             

ìThatís me.î            

ìThatís what I thought, sir.î            

She curtseyed to him (young ladies curtsied in those days) to acknowledge howmuch older and wiser he was than her. He bowed to her again.            

ìI replied to the bank, sir. I told them that since I am an orphan with nofriends who could go with me, I would be grateful if the gentleman from the bankcould travel with me for protection. The gentleman had already left London, butI believe a messenger was sent after him to ask him to wait for me here.î            

ìI was happy to be given the job,î said Mr. Lorry. ìI will be even happier toperform it.î            

ìThank you, sir. I am very grateful. The bank told me that you would explainthe details of the situation to me, and that I should prepare myself to besurprised by what I hear. I have prepared myself as best I can. Naturally, I amanxious to know what this is all about.î            

ìOf course,î said Mr. Lorry. ìYesóIóî            

After a pause, he adjusted his blond wig around his ears and added, ìIt isvery difficult to begin.î            

He did not begin, and unable to decide how to proceed, looked her in the eye.Her forehead wrinkled into that unique, though attractive, expression. Sheraised her hand impulsively, as if trying to catch a passing shadow.            

ìHave we ever met before, sir?î            

ìWould we have?î Mr. Lorry opened his hands and extended them toward her withan awkward smile.            

Between her eyebrows and just above her dainty little nose, which was as fineand delicate as possible, her expression deepened. She sat down thoughtfully inthe chair next to which she had been standing. He watched her as she thought,and as soon as she looked up again, he continued:            

ìIn England, where you now live, I suppose I should speak to you the way Iwould speak to any young English lady. Yes, Miss Manette?î            

ìIf you please, sir.î            

ìMiss Manette, I am a businessman. I have a job to do. As you listen to me,donít pay any more attention to me than as if I were just a robotóreally, I amnot much more than that. With your permission, miss, I will tell you a storyabout one of my bankís customers.î            

ìStory?î            

He seemed to purposefully mistake the word she had repeated when he addedquickly, ìYes, customers. In the bank business we usually call our clientscustomers. The customer I will tell you about was a French gentleman, a talentedman of scienceóa doctor.î            

ìNot from Beauvais?î            

ìWhy, yes, from Beauvais. Like your father, Monsieur Manette, this gentlemanwas from Beauvais. And, like your father, this gentleman was well-known inParis. I had the honor of knowing him there. Our dealings were about business,but private. At that time I had been working at our branch in France for, oh,twenty years.î            

ìMay I ask, what time this was, sir?î            

ìIím talking about twenty years ago, miss. He married an English lady and Iwas one of the trustees of their affairs. His affairs, like the affairs of manyFrench gentlemen and their families, were entirely in the hands of Tellsonís. Ina similar way, I am, or have been, a trustee of sorts for many of our customers.These relationships are entirely business, miss. They are not friendships. Ihave moved from one to the next over the course of my work, just as I pass fromone customer to the next during my work day. In other words, I have no feelingstoward these people. I am only a machine. To continueóî             

ìThis sounds like my fatherís story, sirîóshe looked at him intenselyóìand Iímstarting to think that when my mother died only two years after my father did,and I became an orphan, you were the one that brought me to England. I am almostsure it was you.î            

Mr. Lorry took her hesitating little hand that reached forward to take his,and raised it to his lips. He then brought the young woman immediately to herchair again. Holding the back of the chair with his left hand, and using hisright to rub his chin, adjust his wig, and emphasize what he said, he stoodlooking down into her face as she sat looking up at his.             

ìMiss Manette, it was me. And you will see how I was telling the truth when Isaid I have no personal feelings, and the relationships I have are allprofessional. This is why I havenít seen you since then. No, you have been award of Tellsonís Bank since then, and I have been busy with the bankís otherbusiness. I have no time for feelings. I spend all of my time working for thegreat financial machine.î             

After this strange description of his work life, Mr. Lorry flattened his blondwig on his head with both hands (which was really unnecessary, since it wasalready as flat as could be) and continued.            

ìSo far, miss, as you have said, this is the story you have heard about yourpoor father. This next part is different, though. If your father had not diedwhen he didóDonít be afraid! What a reaction!î            

She had jumped and had grabbed his wrist with both her hands.            

ìPlease,î said Mr. Lorry soothingly. He took his left hand off the back of thechair and placed it on her fingers, which clasped on him in a violent tremble:ìPlease control yourself. Itís a business matter. As I was sayingóî            

She looked so upset that he lost track of what he was saying, and startedover:            

ìAs I was saying, what if Monsieur Manette had not died? What if he hadsuddenly and silently disappeared? What if he had been taken away? It would beeasy to guess what kind of place he was taken to, but what if no one could findhim? What if he had had an enemy in France who had such power that even thebravest people were afraid to whisper about him? The power, for instance, tosend anyone to prison for any length of time. What if his wife had begged theking, the queen, the members of the court, and the church for any news abouthim, but with no success? If this were true, then your fatherís story would bethe same as that of the poor doctor from Beauvais.î             

ìI beg you to tell me more, sir.î            

ìI will. I am going to. Can you handle it?î            

ìI can handle anything but the uncertainty youíre causing me rightnow.î            

ìYou speak calmly, and you are calm. Thatís good!î said Mr. Lorry, though hiswords were more convincing than his behavior. ìThink of it as a business matter,a job that must be done. Now if this doctorís wife, although she was a bravewoman, had suffered so much before her little child was bornóî            

ìThe little child was a daughter, sir.î            

ìYes, a daughter. Remember, this is a business matteródonít be upset. Perhaps,the poor woman had suffered so much before her little child was born that shedecided to spare the poor child the same pain by raising her to believe that herfather was dead.î Miss Manette kneeled down in front of him. ìNo, donít kneeldown! In the name of Heaven, why should you kneel down to me!î            

ìFor telling me the truth. Oh good, kind sir, for telling me thetruth!î            

ìAóitís a business matter. Youíre confusing me, and how can I do my job if Iímconfused? Letís be clear-headed. Please tell me now, for instance, how much ninetimes nine pence is, or how many shillings are in twenty guineas. That wouldmake me feel better about your state of mind.î             

She didnít answer him. But she remained so still after he sat her up in herchair, and her hands, as they held his wrists, were so much steadier thanbefore, that she communicated calmness to Mr. Jarvis Lorry.             

ìThatís right, thatís right. Be brave! This is business! You have business infront of you, important business. Miss Manette, this is how your mother decidedto handle things. She never gave up her search for your father, though she wasunsuccessful. When she diedóI believe broken-heartedóshe left you at two yearsold to grow up beautiful and happy. She didnít want you wondering whether yourfather died soon after going to prison, or if he wasted away over the course ofmany years.î            

As he spoke, he looked down with admiration and pity on her flowing goldenhair, and he imagined that it might already be streaked with gray.            

ìYou know that your parents didnít have much, and what they did have was givento you and your mother. No new money or any other property has been discovered,butóî            

He felt her grab his wrist tighter and stopped speaking. The expression on herforehead, which had so much attracted his attention, had deepened into one ofpain and horror.            

ìBut he has beenóbeen found. He is alive. He has probably changed a lot. Hemight be a broken man, though we will hope for the best. Still, heís alive. Yourfather has been taken to the house of one of his former servants in Paris, andwe are going there. I go to identify him, if I can. You go to bring him back tolife. To take bring him love, duty, rest, and comfort.î            

A shiver ran through her body and his. She said, in a low, clear, awe-struckvoice, as if she were in a dream:            

ìI am going to see his ghost! It will be his ghost, not him!î            

Mr. Lorry quietly rubbed her hands, which held his arm. ìThere now, there now!You know the best and the worst of it now. You are well on your way to seeingthe poor mistreated gentleman. If the journey goes well, you will soon be withhim.î             

She repeated in the same tone, as low as a whisper, ìI have been free, I havebeen happy, but his ghost has never haunted me!î            

ìOne more thing,î said Mr. Lorry, emphasizing the words to get her attention.ìHe was discovered under another name, his own name being either long forgottenor hidden. It wouldnít do any good to ask which was the case, or to ask if heídbeen held prisoner so long by mistake or on purpose. Itís best not to ask aroundabout it because it would be dangerous. Better not to mention it, and to get himout of France, at least for a while. Even I, who am safe because I am anEnglishman, and even Tellsonís Bank, as important as it is to the credit of theFrench government, need to stay out of the matter. I carry nothing in writingthat directly refers to this matter. This is an entirely secret operation. Allinformation pertaining to the matter is contained in the one line ëBrought backto life,í which could mean anything. But whatís the matter? She doesnít hear aword! Miss Manette!î            

She sat completely still and silent in her chair, completely shocked. Her eyeswere open and focused on him, and she still had that expression on her forehead,as if it had been carved or branded there. She was holding onto his arm sotightly that he was afraid that if he took it away he would hurt her. He stayedstill and yelled out for help.            

A wild-looking woman came running into the room ahead of some of the hotelstaff. Even in his agitation, Mr. Lorry noticed she was all in red, with redhair, and wore a bizarre, tight-fitting outfit and a bonnet that looked like asoldierís hat, or a large wooden spoon, or a block of cheese. The woman detachedhim from Miss Manetteís grip by laying a brawny hand on Mr. Lorryís chest andthrowing him against the nearest wall.            

(ìI think sheís actually a man!î Mr. Lorry thought as he hit the wall.)            

ìWhy, look at you all!î the woman yelled at the inn servants. ìWhy donít yougo get some things to help her instead of standing there staring at me? I am notthat pretty, am I? Why donít you go get some things to help her. Iíll teach youa lesson if you donít bring me smelling salts, cold water, and vinegarquickly!î            

The servants immediately ran off, and the woman softly laid Miss Manette on asofa. She attended to her with great skill and gentleness, calling her ìmyprecious!î and ìmy bird!î and spreading her blonde hair out over her shoulderswith great pride and care.            

ìAnd you in the brown!î she said, turning angrily to Mr. Lorry. ìCouldnít yousay what you needed to say without frightening her to death? Look at her, withher pretty pale face and her cold hands. Do you call that beinga banker?!î            

Mr. Lorry was so unsettled by the tricky question that he could only look onfrom a distance with pathetic sympathy and humility. Meanwhile, the strongwoman, having sent away the servants with the vague threat that she would ìteachthem a lesson,î which she didnít specify, slowly brought Miss Manette back toconsciousness and placed the young ladyís drooping head on her shoulder.            

ìI hope sheíll feel better now,î said Mr. Lorry.            

ìNo thanks to you in the bown, if she does,î the woman responded. ìMy prettydarling!î            

ìI hope you will accompany Miss Manette to France,î said Mr. Lorry afteranother pause of pathetic sympathy and humility.             

ìNot very likely!î replied the strong woman. ìIf I was supposed to traveloverseas, do you suppose Fate would have put me on an island?î            

This was another tricky question, and Mr. Jarvis Lorry went away to thinkabout it.             

A large wine cask had been dropped and lay broken in the street. The accidenthappened while people were taking it out of a cart. The cask had rolled outquickly, its hoops burst, and it now lay on the stones just outside the door ofthe wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell.            

Everyone nearby had stopped what they were doing and ran to drink the spilledwine. The streetís cobblestones were oddly shaped and stuck out in alldirections, as if they were made just to injure those who walked on them. Thestones divided the spilled wine into little puddles, and a crowd proportional toeach puddleís size surrounded each one. Some men kneeled down and made scoopswith their hands, and sipped. Or they tried to give sips to the women bendingover them before the wine ran out between their fingers. Other men and womendipped old clay mugs into the puddles, or even soaked the wine up with womenísheadscarves then squeezed it into their babiesí mouths. Others piled up moundsof mud to stop the flow of wine. Others, directed by people watching from thewindows above, ran around trying to stop the little streams. Others concentratedon the red pieces of the cask, licking or chewing the wine-soaked wood eagerly.There was no drainage system to carry away the wine, and not only did the peopledrink all the wine, but so much mud was cleared away with it that people mighthave thought a street cleaner had come by, if any of them believed a streetcleaner would actually come to such a poor neighborhood.            

The sounds of laughter and amused voices, coming from men, women, andchildren, sounded in the street while the people drank up the wine. There was alittle roughness to the event, and a lot of playfulness. There was a specialcamaraderie in it, an urge in everyone to join in with someone else. This led,especially among the light-hearted ones, to playful hugs, toasts, andhandshakes, and even to as many as a dozen people joining hands and dancing.When the wine was gone, and one could see the patterns in the mud where peoplehad scratched it to get wine, the festivities abruptly ended. The man who hadleft his saw stuck in the firewood he was cutting went back to work. The womenreturned to their door-steps where they had left little pots of hot ashes, inwhich they tried to ease the pain in their own hungry fingers and toes or inthose of their children. Sleeveless men with dirty, matted hair and thin faceswho had crept out of cellars into the daylight went back inside. The mood on thestreet returned to its natural gloom.             

The red wine had stained the ground where it spilled on the narrow street, inthe Paris suburb of Saint Antoine. It had stained many hands, faces, bare feet,and wooden shoes, too. The hands of the man who sawed wood left red marks on thelogs. The forehead of the woman who nursed her baby was stained from the old ragshe wrapped around her head again. Those who had greedily chewed on pieces ofthe cask now had a tiger-like smear across their mouths. One tall pranksterwearing a long, filthy nightcap dipped his finger in the mixture of mud and wineand wrote the word blood on a wall.             

The time would come when blood, too, would be spilled on the streets, and manyof the people would be stained with it.            

The gloomy mood that had disappeared briefly from Saint Antoine now returned.Cold, dirt, sickness, lack of education, and poverty caused the darkness of thatmood. All were serious problems, especially poverty. A few people, who had beenworn down as if in a mill, and not a magical mill that makes old people young,shivered at every corner. They passed in and out at every doorway, looked fromevery window, fluttered in their ragged clothing, which the wind shook. The millhad ground them down, making the young people seem old. The children had veryold faces and harsh voices, and hunger was on every face, young and old. It waseverywhere. The wrinkles of their aged faces and every breath they tooksuggested hunger. The tall houses and the tattered clothes that hung on thepoles and clotheslines suggested hunger. The clothes sewn together from strawand rags and wood and paper suggested hunger. The small bits of firewood the manwas sawing, and the chimneys that had no smoke coming out of them suggestedhunger. The filthy streets covered in trash but not a bit of food suggestedhunger. The bakerís shelves and every tiny loaf of his small supply of bad breadsuggested hunger. The sausage shop, where they sold sausages made from deaddogs, suggested hunger. The rattling of chestnuts in a roaster, and the bits ofpotatoes, fried with just a few drops of oil, suggested hunger.            

The neighborhood was wellsuited to hunger. It had a filthy, narrow, windingstreet with other narrow and winding streets branching off it, all filled withpoor people in smelly rags and nightcaps. Everything had a sinister, sickly lookto it. In the desperation of the people there was the animal instinct to revolt.As sad and downtrodden as they were, they had fiery looks in their eyes. Many ofthem had tight lips that had turned white from the strain of keeping silent.Many people had frowns on their foreheads in the shape of a hangmanís ropeóarope they imagined themselves hanging from, or pictured using to hang someoneelse. Poverty was on display in each of the many shop signs. The butcher andpork sellerís signs had only the leanest scraps of meat on them. The bakeríssign had only rough, small loaves of bread. The people crudely displayed in thewine shop signs were scowling suspiciously over their small servings of weakwine and beer. No one was shown as prosperous except for the sellers of toolsand weapons. The knife sellerís knives and axes were portrayed as sharp andbright. The smithís hammers looked strong and heavy. The gun makerís guns lookeddeadly. The cobblestone streets, with their many little pools of mud and water,had no walkways. The gutter flowed down the middle of the streetówhen it flowedat all. That was only during heavy rains, and then it overflowed and ran intothe houses. On either side of the street, at wide intervals, a single lamp washung by a rope and pulley. At night, after the lamplighter had lowered them, litthem, and then raised them up again, a sad group of dimly lit candles hungweakly overhead as if they were on a boat at sea. In a way they were at sea, andall of the people were in imminent danger.             

For the time would come when the gaunt, jobless, and hungry citizens whowatched the lamplighter for so long would think up a better way to do his job.They would hang men by those ropes and pulleys, instead of lamps, revealingtheir inner darkness. But that time had not yet come. Instead, everyone ignoredthe warning signs that revolution might be on its way.            

The wine shop was on a corner. It was nicer than most other shops, and theowner stood outside wearing a yellow jacket and green pants, watching peoplefight for the spilled wine. ìItís not my problem,î he said, shrugging hisshoulders. ìItís the market peopleís fault. Let them bring me another cask.î        

Then he saw the tall prankster writing on the wall. He yelled to the manacross the street.            

ìHey, Gaspard! What are you doing over there?î            

The man pointed proudly to the word he had written, as pranksters often do.The joke failed, as prankstersí jokes often do as well.             

ìWhat are you doing? Are you crazy?î said the owner of the wine shop, crossingthe road and covering the word with a handful of mud. ìWhy are you writing thisin public? Tell me, is there no other place you can write such words?î            

While he was talking, he placed his clean hand (possibly by accident, possiblynot) over the pranksterís heart. The prankster tapped it with his own hand,jumped up quickly, and landed in a strange dancing pose, holding one of hisstained shoe in his hand threateningly. The prankster was a resourceful man.        

ìPut your shoe back on,î said the wine shop owner. ìGo get some wine and leavethat alone.î He wiped his dirty hand on the pranksterís dirty clothes, since theprankster was the reason he had gotten his hand dirty in the first place. Thenhe went back to the wine shop.             

The wine shop owner was a stocky, military-looking thirty-year-old man. Hemust have had a hot temper, since he wore no coat even though it was bitterlycold, though he carried a coat slung over his shoulder. His sleeves were rolledup and his tan arms were bare to his elbows. He wore no hat either, just hisshort, curly, dark hair. He had a dark complexion, and his good eyes were spacedfar apart. He was a pleasant-looking man overall, but stubborn-looking, too. Hewas a decisive man of strong principles. You wouldnít want to see him chargingtoward you on a narrow bridge, because nothing would stop him.             

Madame Defarge, his wife, was sitting behind the shop counter when he came in.She was a large woman about the same age as he was, with alert eyes that rarelyseemed to look directly at anything. She had large hands with many rings onthem, a calm face, strong features, and had great self-control. There wassomething about her that made you think that she rarely made mistakes. MadameDefarge, being sensitive to the cold, was wrapped up in fur. She had a large,brightly colored shawl wrapped around her head, though it didnít hide her largeearrings. Her knitting was in front of her, where she had laid it down to pickher teeth with a toothpick. She sat picking her teeth with her right elbowsupported by her left hand, and didnít say anything when her husband came in.She cleared her throat and raised her eyebrows slightly, indicating to herhusband that he should look around the shop for any new customers that hadarrived while he was across the street.             

He looked around and saw an old gentleman and a young woman sitting in thecorner. Other people were in the shop too: two were playing cards, two wereplaying dominoes, and three were standing by the counter trying to make the mostof a small amount of wine. As he stepped behind the counter, he noticed the oldgentleman give a look to the young woman as if to say, ìThis is the man weírelooking for.î            

ìWhat the devil are you doing here?î Monsieur Defargethought. ìI donít know you.î            

He pretended not to notice the two strangers and went to talk with the threecustomers drinking at the counter.            

ìHowís it going, Jacques?î said one of the three to Monsieur Defarge. ìHas allthe spilled wine been drunk?î            

ìEvery drop, Jacques,î answered Monsieur Defarge.             

After this greeting by first names, Madame Defarge, while picking her teethwith her toothpick, cleared her throat again and raised her eyebrows a bithigher.             

ìIt is not often,î the second man said to Monsieur Defarge, ìthat thesepathetic creatures get to taste wine, or anything besides black bread and death.Donít you agree, Jacques?î            

ìThatís true, Jacques,î Monsieur Defarge returned.             

After this second exchange of first names, Madame Defarge, still calmlypicking her teeth, cleared her throat again and raised her eyebrows a bithigher.             

The third man now set down his empty cup, smacked his lips, and said:             

ìAh! Thatís even worse! These poor animals always have a sour taste in theirmouths, and their lives are hard, Jacques. Am I right, Jacques?î             

ìYou are right, Jacques,î answered Monsieur Defarge.            

They completed this third exchange of first names just as Madame Defarge putdown her toothpick and shifted slightly in her seat, with her eyebrows stillup.            

ìHold up. Wait,î muttered Monsieur Defarge. ìGentlemen, this is mywife!î            

The three customers took off their hats and gestured grandly to MadameDefarge. She acknowledged their respect by bowing her head and giving them aquick look. Then she looked casually around the wine shop and calmly went backto her knitting.             

ìGood day, gentlemen,î said her husband, who had been watching her carefully.ìThe apartment you had asked about while I was out is on the fifth floor. Thedoorway of the staircase opens out onto a little courtyard close to the lefthere, near the window of my shop,î he said, pointing with his hand. ìBut now Iremember that one of you has been there before and can lead way. Goodbye,gentlemen!î            

They paid for the wine and left. Monsieur Defarge was watching his wife knitwhen the old gentleman came over and asked to speak with him.             

ìOf course, sir,î Monsieur Defarge said and walked quietly with him to thedoor.             

Their conversation was short but to the point. Almost at the first word,Monsieur Defarge jumped to attention. Moments later, he nodded and went out. Thegentleman motioned to the young lady, and they also went out. Madame Defargekept knitting and pretended not to notice.             

Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette came out of the wine shop and joinedMonsieur Defarge in the doorway he had just directed the three customers to. Itopened onto a dark, stinking little courtyard that served as the public entranceto many houses, where a great number of people lived. In the gloomy tiled entryto the gloomy tiled staircase, Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee in frontof the child of his old master and kissed her hand. Though the gesture was kind,he didn't do it kindly. In just a few seconds, he had changed. His face was nolonger pleasant or friendly, but had become secretive, angry, and dangerous.        

ìIt is very high up, and a little difficult to get to. Itís best to startslowly,î Monsieur Defarge said in a stern voice to Mr. Lorry as they began toclimb the stairs.            

ìIs he alone?î Mr. Lorry whispered.            

ìAlone? God help him, who would be with him!î said Monsieur Defarge, in thesame quiet voice.             

ìIs he always alone?î            

ìYes.î            

ìBy his own choice?î            

ìHe needs to be. Heís been the same since I first saw himósince they found meand asked if I would take care of him in secret.î            

ìHas he changed much?î            

ìChanged!î            

Monsieur Defarge stopped to hit the wall with his hand, and he cursed. Nodirect answer could have been half as effective. Mr. Lorryís mood grew grimmeras he and the two others climbed the stairs.             

An old staircase like this one, located in the older and more crowded parts ofParis, would be bad enough today1859today. But back then they were particularly disgusting,especially to people who werenít used to them. Every little apartment in one ofthese large buildings that opened onto the public staircase dumped its garbageon the landing. Other refuse got thrown out the windows. This unmanageable andhopeless pile of rotting garbage would have polluted the air even if it had notbeen the garbage of the poor, but the combination of trash and poverty made thesmell almost unbearable. The three people walked through all this filth and up asteep, dark, dirty stairwell. Giving in to his own troubled thoughts and to MissManetteís anxiety, which became greater every moment, Mr. Jarvis Lorry stoppedtwice to rest. Each stop was made near a miserable air vent, through which anyclean air that was left seemed to escape, and through which rotten air seemed toenter. Through the air vents you could taste, rather than see, parts of theneighborhood. Nothing nearby, from that spot to the great towers of Notre Dame,showed any signs of good health or good thoughts.             

At last they reached the top of the staircase, and they stopped for the thirdtime. They still needed to climb a steeper, narrower upper staircase to reachthe attic. The owner of the wine shop walked a little ahead of them and alwaysstayed next to Mr. Lorry, as though afraid the young lady might ask him aquestion. He turned around and carefully removed a key from the pocket of thecoat he carried over his shoulder.             

ìThen the door is locked, my friend?î asked Mr. Lorry, surprised.            

ìOh, yes,î Monsieur Defarge answered seriously.            

ìYou think itís necessary to keep the poor gentleman locked up?î            

ìI think itís necessary to turn the key,î Monsieur Defarge whispered in hisear, and frowned heavily.             

ìWhy?î            

ìWhy! Because he has been locked up for so long that he would be afraid, gomad, tear himself apart, die, or some other terrible thing if his door were leftopen.î            

ìIs that possible?î exclaimed Mr. Lorry.            

ìIs that possible!î repeated Defarge, bitterly. ìYes, and what a wonderfulworld we live in when such a thing is possible, and not only possible, buthappensóactually happens!óevery day. Long live the devil. Letís keepgoing.î            

They spoke too quietly for the young woman to hear, but by now fear andanxiety shook her so much that Mr. Lorry felt he should reassure her.             

ìBe brave, miss! Courage! This is business! The worst part will be over in amoment. Itís just walking into a room, and the worst is over. Then, all thegoodness, all the relief, all the happiness youíll bring him will begin. Let ourgood friend here help you. Our good friend Monsieur Defarge. Come, now.Business, business!î             

They went up slowly and quietly. The staircase was short, and they were soonat the top. As they rounded a sharp turn in the staircase, they suddenly sawthree men. Their heads were bent down close together at the side of the door,and they were intently looking into the room through some cracks in the wall.When they heard footsteps approach, the three men turned and stood up. They werethe three men named Jacques who had been drinking in the wine shop.             

ìI forgot about them when your visit surprised me,î explained MonsieurDefarge. ìGo away, my friends; we have business here.î            

The three men slipped past and went silently downstairs.             

Since there didnít appear to be any other doors on that floor, and thewine-shop owner went straight to this one when they were alone, Mr. Lorry askedhim in a whisper, a little angry:            

ìAre you making a spectacle of Monsieur Manette?î            

ìI show him, in the way you just saw, to a select few.î            

ìIs that proper?î            

ìI think itís proper.î            

ìWho are the few? How do you select them?î            

ìI select true men. Men with my name, Jacques, who would benefit from seeinghim. I wonít say anymore. You are English. You wouldnít understand. Please waitthere for a moment.î            

He motioned for them to stay back, then leaned over and looked in through thecrack in the wall. Soon he raised his head and knocked two or three times on thedooróapparently just to make noise. For this same reason, he dragged the keyacross the door three or four times before clumsily putting it in the lock andloudly turning it.             

He slowly opened the door slowly, looked into the room, and said something. Aquiet voice answered back. Neither person spoke much more than a syllable.        

Defarge looked back over his shoulder and motioned for them to enter. Mr.Lorry felt Miss Manette sink so he put his arm around her waist.             

ìA-a-a-business, business!î he said, with a tear on his cheek that had nothingto do with business. ìCome in!î            

ìIím afraid of it,î she answered, trembling.             

ìOf ëití? Of what?î            

ìI mean of him. Of my father.î            

Concerned by the state she was in and by the gesturing of Monsieur Defarge,Mr. Lorry pulled her arm around his neck, lifted her slightly, and rushed herinto the room. He sat her down just inside the door and held her as she clung tohim.             

Defarge took out the key, closed the door, and locked it from the inside. Thenhe took the key and held it in his hand. He did all of this methodically, makingas much noise as he could. Finally he crossed the room to the window, where hestopped and turned around.             

The attic had been built to be a storage room for firewood and other things.It was dim and dark. The window was actually a door in the roof, with a smallpulley over it for lifting things from the street. There were no windowpanes,and it had two pieces that met in the middle to close it, like any other Frenchdoor. To keep out the cold, one half of the door was closed tight, and the otherwas opened very slightly. Such a small amount of light came through that it washard to see anything when one first entered the room. It would have taken a longtime to adjust to the darkness enough to be able to do any kind of detailed workthere. Yet, that kind of work was being done in the attic. With his back to thedoor and his face toward the window where Monsieur Defarge stood looking at him,a white-haired man sat on a short bench, bent over and very busy, making shoes.        

ìGood day!î said Monsieur Defarge to the white-haired man, who was bent overmaking shoes.             

The man looked up for a moment and answered quietly, as if he were faraway:            

ìGood day!î            

ìYou are still hard at work, I see?î            

After a long pause, the man looked up and answered. ìYes, I am working.î Thistime the man raised his haggard eyes up to him before looking down again.        

His voice was so quiet it was pitiful and dreadful. It wasnít quiet becausethe man was physically weak, although being locked up and treated badly had donetheir part. His voice was quiet because he had been kept alone and hadnít usedit. It was like the last feeble echo of a sound made a long, long time ago. Ithad lost so much of its liveliness and sound that it was like a beautiful colorthat has faded away to a faint stain. It was so low that it sounded like it wascoming from underground. It was so sad and hopeless that it would have remindeda starving traveler, exhausted by wandering in the wilderness, of his home andfriends just before he lied down to die.             

The man worked silently for a few minutes. His tired eyes looked up again, notwith any interest or curiosity, but mechanically, and he noticed that MonsieurDefarge had not yet left.             

ìI want to let a little more light in here,î said Defarge, who was stillstaring at the shoemaker. ìCan you handle a little more light?î            

Monsieur Manette stopped working. He looked down at the floor beside him witha vacant air of listening, then at the floor on the other side of him, then upat Monsieur Defarge.             

ìWhat did you say?î            

ìCan you stand a little more light?î            

ìI must stand it, if you let more in,î he said, slightly stressing the word    must.            

Defarge propped the half door open a little more. A broad shaft of light cameinto the attic and revealed the shoemaker with an unfinished shoe in his lap ashe paused his work. A few basic tools and some leather scraps were around him athis feet and on the bench. He had a white, ragged beard that wasnít very long, athin face, and very bright eyes. The emptiness and thinness of his face wouldordinarily have made his eyes look large under his dark eyebrows and tangledwhite hair. But they were naturally large, so now they looked unnaturally big.His yellow, tattered shirt was open at the throat, showing that his body wasskinny and worn out. The old man, his old coat, his baggy stockings, and histattered clothes had all been away from light and air for so long that they hadturned a single shade of yellow, making it hard to distinguish one from theother.             

He raised his hand to shield his eyes from the light, and even the bones of itseemed transparent. He had stopped working and sat there with a steady, emptylook. He never looked at the man in front of him without first looking down onthis side of himself, then on the other, as if he had forgotten how to tellwhere sound was coming from. He never said anything without doing this first,then forgetting to speak.             

ìAre you going to finish that pair of shoes today?î asked Defarge, motioningto Mr. Lorry to come forward.             

ìWhat did you say?î            

ìDo you plan on finishing that pair of shoes today?î            

ìI canít say that I plan to. I guess so. I donít know.î            

The question reminded him of his work, and he bent over the shoes and startedworking again.            

Mr. Lorry moved forward silently, leaving Miss Manette by the door. After hehad stood next to Defarge for a minute or two, the shoemaker looked up. Hedidnít seem surprised to see another person, but the shaky fingers on one of hishands moved to his lips as he looked at him. (His lips and nails were both thesame pale lead color.) Then he dropped his hand back to the shoes and startedworking again. This look and action happened in an instant.             

ìYou have a visitor, you see,î said Monsieur Defarge.             

ìWhat did you say?î            

ìThere is a visitor here to see you.î            

The shoemaker looked up as he had before, but without taking his hand off theshoes.             

ìCome!î said Defarge. ìHere is a man who knows a well-made shoe when he seesone. Show him that shoe youíre working on. Take it, monsieur.î            

Mr. Lorry took the shoe in his hand.            

ìTell this man what kind of shoe it is and who made it.î            

There was a longer pause than usual before the shoemaker answered:            

ìI forget what you asked me. What did you say?î            

ìI said, wonít you describe to this man what kind of shoe it is?î            

ìIt is a ladyís shoe. It is a young ladyís walking shoe. Itís in the lateststyle. Iíve never seen the style, but Iíve had a pattern to work from.î Helooked at the shoe with a slight hint of pride.             

ìAnd who made it?î asked Defarge.             

Now that he didnít have the shoes to hold onto, he kept wringing his hands andstroking his beard. Every time he finished speaking, the manís mind would wanderoff again. Trying to keep his attention was like trying to revive a person whohad fainted, or like trying to keep a dying man alive to get information fromhim.             

ìDid you ask me what my name was?î            

ìYes, I did.î            

ìMy name is One Hundred and Five, North Tower.î            

ìIs that it?î            

ìOne Hundred and Five, North Tower.î            

With a weary sound that wasnít a sigh or a groan he resumed working, until thesilence was broken again.             

ìYouíre not a professional shoemaker, are you?î asked Mr. Lorry, staring athim.            

The man looked wearily at Defarge as if he wanted him to answer the questionfor him. When Defarge didnít respond, the man looked at the ground and then backat Mr. Lorry.             

ìAm I professional shoemaker? No, I was not a professional shoemaker. I-Ilearned how to make shoes here. I taught myself. I asked permission toÖî            

He stared off for a few minutes, wringing his hands the whole time. Slowly helooked back toward Mr. Lorry. When he looked at him he flinched and started upagain as if he had just been woken up and was continuing a conversation from thenight before.            

ìI asked permission to teach myself, and after fighting with them a long timethey let me. I have been making shoes ever since. ì            

He held out a hand for the shoe that Mr. Lorry was holding. Mr. Lorry wasstill staring at him.             

ìMonsieur Manette, donít you remember me?î asked Mr. Lorry.             

Monsieur Manette dropped the shoe and sat staring at Mr. Lorry.            

Mr. Lorry put his hand on Defargeís arm. ìMonsieur Manette,î Mr. Lorry said,laying his hand upon Defargeís arm, ìdonít you remember this man? Look at him.Look at me. Do you not remember an old banker? Some old business? An oldservant? A time long ago, Monsieur Manette?î            

As the man whoíd been imprisoned for many years sat looking intently at Mr.Lorry and Defarge, some signs of intelligence that had been hidden for a longtime started to break through. They were cloudy and weak and they came and went,but they were there. The young woman had crept along the wall to where she couldsee him. The exact same expression that was on the old manís face was on herface. She stood there looking at him. At first she had raised her hands in fear,to keep him away or hide him from her sight. Now she was reaching out towardhim, trembling eagerly to embrace the poor man and give him life and hope withher love. The expression on her pretty, young face was so much like the one onhis (though stronger on hers) that it looked as if it had been passed like abeam of light from his face to hers.             

His mind clouded over again. He looked at the two men with less and lessunderstanding, and his eyes wandered back to the ground the way they had before.Finally, sighing deeply, he picked up the shoe and went back to work.             

ìDid you recognize him, monsieur?î whispered Defarge.            

ìYes. For just a second. At first I thought it was hopeless. But I havedefinitely seen, for one moment, the face that I once knew very well. Quiet!Letís move back a little. Quiet!î            

Miss Manette had moved away from the attic wall and was very close to thebench he sat on. There was something terrible about the fact that he was unawareof someone so close she could have reached out and touched him.             

No one said a word. No one made a sound. She stood next to him like a ghost ashe bent over his work.             

After a while he put down the tool in his hand to pick up his shoemakerísknife. It was on the side of the bench opposite where she stood. He had pickedit up and was leaning over to start working again when he noticed the bottom ofher dress. He looked up and saw her face. Mr. Lorry and Defarge started to moveforward to protect her, but she stopped them with a motion of her hand. Shedidnít fear him stabbing her with his knife, though the two men did.             

He stared at her with a frightened look. After a while he started to formwords with his lips, although he wasnít making any sound. Little by little, inbetween his quick, heavy breaths, he said:            

ìWhat is this?î            

With tears running down her face, she blew him a kiss with both hands. Thenshe placed her hands on her heart as if she were holding his head to it.             

ìYou arenít the jailerís daughter?î            

ìNo,î she sighed.            

ìWho are you?î            

Still afraid to speak, she sat down next to him on the bench. He pulled away,but she placed her hand on his arm. As she did, a strange excitement struck him,and passed through him visibly. He gently put down the knife and sat therestaring at her.             

Her long, curly blond hair had been brushed aside and fell down over her neck.Moving his hand toward her little by little, he picked up her hair and looked atit. While doing this, his mind wandered again, and with another deep sigh, hewent back to his shoemaking.            

This didnít last long, though. Letting go of his arm, she placed her hand onhis shoulder. He looked at it suspiciously two or three times, as if to makesure it was really there. Then he laid down his work, reached his hand up to hisneck, and removed a black string with a folded scrap of rag tied to it.Carefully he unfolded it on his knee. Inside were one or two long golden hairs,which he had wrapped around his finger long ago.             

He took her hair in his hand again and looked closely at it. ìItís the same.How can that be! When! How!î            

As the intense expression reappeared on his forehead, he seemed to realizethat the same expression was on her forehead too. He moved her into the lightand looked at her.             

ìThe night I was taken away, she had put her head on my shoulder. She wasafraid I was going away, though I wasnít. When they brought me to the NorthTower they found these hairs on my sleeve. ìëWill you leave them with me?í Iasked. ëThey canít help me escape this place physically, though they may help meescape spiritually.í Those were the words I said. I remember them verywell.î            

He formed these words silently with his lips many times before he could saythem out loud. When he did finally speak them, he said them clearly, thoughslowly.             

ìHow did this happen? WAS IT YOU?î            

Once again the two men jumped as the old man turned toward her suddenly. Butshe sat completely still there as he held onto her and only said quietly,ìPlease, gentlemen, donít come near us. Donít speak. Donít move.î            

ìListen!î Monsieur Manette cried. ìWhose voice was that?î            

He let go of her as he yelled this out and tore at his white hair in a frenzy.This fit died down, much like everything had died out of him over the yearsexcept for his interest in shoemaking. He folded up the rag and tried to tie itaround his neck again. He was still looking at her and sadly shaking his head.        

ìNo, no, no. You are too young. Too full of life. It canít be you. These arenot the hands she knew, this is not the face she knew, this is not a voice sheever heard. No, no. She was, and he was, before all those slow-moving years Ispent in the North Toweróyears ago. What is your name, my gentle angel?î            

Noticing that he had softened his tone of voice and behavior, his daughterfell down on her knees in front of him and placed her hands on his chest.        

ìOh, sir! Some other time I will tell you my name, and who my mother was, andwho my father was, and how I never knew their awful story. But I canít tell youright now, not here. All I can ask right now is that you touch me and give meyour blessing. Kiss me, kiss me! Oh my dear, my dear!î            

His cold white hair mixed with her shining blond hair, and it was as if herhair warmed his like the light of freedom shining on him.            

ìIf my voiceóI donít know if it does, but if soóif it reminds you of a voicethat was once sweet music in your ears, cry for it! If touching my hair remindsyou of the head that once rested on your chest when you were young and free, cryfor it! If I hint that a home awaits you where I will take care of you, and itreminds you of the long-empty home you remembered from afar, cry for it!î            

She hugged him around the neck and rocked him back and forth like a child.        

ìI tell you that your agony is over, and that Iíve come here to take you fromit, and that weíre going to England to be at peace. If that causes you to thinkof your wasted life, and how our home country, France, has mistreated you, cryfor it! When I tell you my name, and about my father who is living, and about mymother who is dead, if you find out that I must beg my fatherís forgivenessbecause I didnít stay awake crying all night since my mother never told me ofhis imprisonment, cry for it! Cry for her, then, and for me! Gentlemen, thankGod! I feel Godís tears on my face and his sobbing in my heart. ThankGod!î            

He had fallen into her arms and rested his head on her chest. The two men wereso moved by the sight, and by knowing all the injustice and suffering that hadhappened before it, that they covered their faces to hide their tears.             

When it had been quiet in the attic for a while and the old man had stoppedshaking and gave in to the calm that follows any storm, the two men steppedforward. They lifted the man and his daughter up off the ground. He had slowlyfallen to the floor and lay there exhausted. She had settled down with him,keeping her arm under his head. Her hair was draped over his face and shieldedhim from the light.             

Miss Manette raised her hand to Mr. Lorry, as he stooped over them afterrepeatedly blowing his nose, and said, ìIf we can do it without upsetting him, Iwould like to leave for Paris right away.î            

ìBut do you think he is fit to travel?î asked Mr. Lorry.            

ìMore fit to travel, I think, than to stay in this city, where he has beentreated so terribly.î            

ìItís true,î said Defarge, who was kneeling nearby. ìMore importantly,Monsieur Manette will be safer outside of France. Should I hire a carriage andhorses?î            

ìThatís a business matter,î said Mr. Lorry, going back to his professionaldemeanor. ìAnd if business needs to be done, then I should be the one to doit.î            

ìThen will you please leave us here?î asked Miss Manette. ìYou see how calm heis now, and you canít be afraid to leave me here with him. Why should you be? Ifyou will lock the door so no one can bother us, Iím sure you will find him ascalm when you return as he is now. In any case, Iíll take care of him until youget back, and then we will move him right away.î            

Both Mr. Lorry and Defarge thought this was a bad idea and thought one of themshould stay. But someone needed to find a carriage and horses and travelingpapers. The day was almost over, and they were running out of time. The two menfinally decided to divide up these tasks between them, and they hurried off todo them.            

As it grew dark, the young woman lay her head down on the hard ground next toher father and watched him. It got darker and darker, and they both lay therequietly until a light shone through the cracks in the wall.             

Mr. Lorry and Monsieur Defarge had made all the arrangements for the journey.They had brought traveling cloaks and blankets, as well as bread and meat, wine,and hot coffee. Monsieur Defarge put these items, and the lamp he was carrying,on the shoemakerís bench (there was no other furniture in the attic except for asimple bed). He and Mr. Lorry woke up the old man and helped him to his feet.        

No one would have been able to tell from the blank, frightened look on hisface what the man might have been thinking. No one would have been able to tellif he knew what had happened earlier, if he remembered what they had said tohim, or if he knew that he was free. They tried speaking to him, but he was soconfused and slow to answer that they worried he was incoherent and decided toleave him alone. He kept grabbing his head in his hands wildly in a way that hehad not been doing before. Yet, he seemed pleased by the sound of his daughterísvoice and would turn toward her when she spoke.             

In the way of a man used to obeying orders, he ate and drank what they gavehim, and put on the cloak and other clothes they gave him to wear. He happilylet his daughter link arms with him and held her hand with both of his.            

They began to go downstairs, Monsieur Defarge going first with the lamp andMr. Lorry coming last. They hadnít gone many steps down the long main staircasewhen the old man stopped and looked around at the roof and walls.             

ìDo you remember this place, father? Do you remember coming up here?î            

ìWhat did you say?î            

But before she could repeat the question, he mumbled an answer.             

ìDo I remember? No, I donít remember. It was such a long time ago.î            

It was clear that he had no memory of being brought from the prison to thehouse. They heard him mumble, ìOne Hundred and Five, North Tower,î and he lookedaround, apparently searching for the prison walls that had held him captive forso long. When they reached the courtyard he instinctively changed his stride, asif he were expecting to come upon a drawbridge. When there was no drawbridge andhe saw the carriage waiting in the street, he let go of his daughterís hand andgrabbed his head again.             

No crowd was gathered around the door. No one could be seen at any of the manywindows. No one even happened to be walking by on the street. Everything wasstrangely silent. Only one person could be seen, and that was Madame Defarge.She leaned against the doorframe, knitting and pretending to see nothing.        

Monsieur Manette got into a coach and his daughter followed him. Mr. Lorry wasabout to get in when the old man asked pitifully for his shoemaking tools andunfinished shoes. Madame Defarge yelled to her husband that she would get them.Still knitting, she went out of the lamplight and through the courtyard. Shebrought them back quickly and passed them into the coach, and then sheimmediately went back to leaning against the doorframe, knitting and pretendingto see nothing.             

Defarge climbed up on the coach and yelled, ìTo the barrier!î The drivercracked his whip, and the coach drove off under the dim swinging streetlamps.        

They drove through the streets under the swinging streetlamps, which werebrighter in the richer neighborhoods and dimmer in the poorer ones. They passedwell-lit shops and coffee houses, festive crowds, and theaters, until theyarrived at one of the city gates. There they came upon some soldiers withlanterns at a guardhouse. ìGive us your papers, travelers!î ìSee here then,Monsieur Officer,î said Defarge, getting down from the coach and taking thesoldier aside. ìThese papers belong to the white-haired man inside. They wereput in my care, along with the man, at theóî He lowered his voice. There wassome movement among the soldiersí lanterns, and one of the soldiers shined hislantern inside the coach. The soldier looked carefully at the white-haired oldman. ìItís all right. Move on!î said the soldier. ìGoodbyeî said Defarge. And sothey continued on, under a short line of streetlamps that grew dimmer anddimmer, until they were out under the stars.             

Beneath the starsósome so far from earth that experts tell us their light maynot have even reached us yetóthe shadows of the night were large and black. Allthrough the cold and restless night they whispered in the ears of Mr. JarvisLorry, as he sat across from the man who had been buried and then dug out. Hewondered how much of Monsieur Manetteís senses had been lost forever, and howmuch of them he could get back. The shadows whispered the same question asbefore:            

ìDonít you want to be brought back to life?î            

And he got the same answer as before:            

ìI donít know.î            

The end of Book One.             

Tellsonís Bank near Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place, even back in 1780.It was very small, very dark, very ugly, and very uncomfortable. The partnerswho ran the bank were old-fashioned too. They were proud of its smallness,darkness, ugliness, and discomfort. They even boasted that their bank was allthese things, and they believed that it if hadnít been so unpleasant, itwouldnít have been so well respected. The bankers liked to brag about this totheir competitors. Tellsonís Bank, they would say, didnít need elbow room orbright light or fancy decorations. Maybe Noakes and Co. or Snooks Brothersneeded these things, but not Tellsonís Bank!             

Any one these partners would have disinherited his own son for suggesting theyrefurbish Tellsonís. In this way, Tellsonís was like England, which did oftenpunish its citizens for trying to improve laws and customs. But the fact thatpeople had objected to these laws and customs for so long made them morerespected.             

In this way, Tellsonís Bank had become the ideal of inconvenience. You enteredby struggling to push open the creaky old front door, then tripping down twosteps to find yourself in the depressing little place. There were two littlecounters where extremely old men would take your check in their shaky hands andread your signature by the light coming through the dirty windows. These windowswere always covered in the mud from Fleet Street and were made even darker bytheir iron bars and the shadow of Temple Bar. If you needed to see the head ofthe bank, you were sent to something like a holding cell, where you could thinkabout your wasted life until the head of the bank came in with his hands in hispockets. He took your money out of, or put it into, rotten old dusty woodendrawers. Your money smelled old and stale, as if the bills were rotting. Yoursilverware was stored among this filth, and the putrid environment would quicklyruin its polish. Property deeds were stored in old kitchens and washrooms thathad been turned into vaults, and all their moisture evaporated into thebanking-house air. Boxes of family documents were stored upstairs in a room witha giant dining table, on which dinner was never served. Here, even back in 1780,old love letters and letters from your children would just have been spared thehorror of being stared at by the severed heads placed on top of Temple Bar, thekind of barbarous act you would expect to see in ancient Abyssinia or Ashanti.        

But at that time, putting things to death was fashionable in every profession,especially at Tellsonís Bank. Death is natureís cure for everything, includinglegal matters. Anyone who forged documents, wrote bad checks, or opened someoneelseís mail was put to death. Anyone who stole as little as forty shillings andsixpence was sentenced to death. Anyone who stole a horse from the front ofTellsonís Bank or who made fake money was sentenced to death. The people whohandled three-quarters of all the money used in crime were put to death. Notthat it did any good in preventing new crimes. In fact, it probably had theopposite effect. But it simplified each case and tied up any loose ends in eachmatter. So Tellsonís Bank, in its heyday, had been responsible for the deaths ofso many people that if you had placed all of their heads on top of Temple Barinstead of disposing of them privately, they would have blocked out the sunlightfrom the bankís ground floor entirely.             

The old men who worked in the cramped quarters of Tellsonís Bank took theirwork seriously. When the bank hired a young man, they hid him away until he wasold. When they hired a young man at Tellsonís London office, they kept him in adark place and aged him, like a cheese, until he had the Tellson-flavor and moldgrew on him. Only then was he allowed to be seen there, studying large books andstrutting around with an air of self-importance.             

Outside of the bank was a man who did odd jobs and sometimes acted as a porteror messenger. He never came inside, unless he was called in for a particularpurpose. This man was like a living shop sign for the bank. He was always thereduring business hours unless he was out on an errand. If he was away, his son, adirty twelve-year-old scamp who looked just like his father, took his place.People knew that the bank put up with this man. The bank always had someoneworking in this position, and through time and fate, this man had ended up withthe job. His last name was Cruncher, and when he was baptized in the easterlyparish church of Houndsditch, he had been given the first name of Jerry.             

It was seven-thirty on a windy March morning in Mr. Cruncherís apartment inHanging Sword Alley, Whitefriars. The year was Anno DominiThe Year of Our LordAnno Domini 1780. (Mr. Cruncher always calledit ìAnna Dominoes.î Apparently he thought the year of our Lord started the yearthe game of dominoes was invented by a woman named Anna.)            

Mr. Cruncherís apartment was not in a very good neighborhood. It had only tworooms, and only if a closet with a tiny window counted as one of them. He kepthis apartment clean, though. As early as it was this windy March morning, hisbedroom was already scrubbed clean, and the cups and saucers were set out forbreakfast on a clean white tablecloth.             

Mr. Cruncher was asleep under a patchwork quilt, like a Harlequina clown from Italian comedy that wore a costume made up of multicolored patchesHarlequin at home. He wassleeping heavily, but little by little he began to toss and turn in bed, withhis spiky hair looking like it would tear his sheets to shreds. Finally he satup and yelled out in frustration:            

ìBust me, if she isnít at it again!î            

A neatly dressed woman quickly got up off her knees in the corner, with enoughspeed and fear to show that she was the woman he referred to.            

ìWhat!î said Mr. Cruncher, looking around the bed for his boot. ìYouíre at itagain, are you?î            

After shouting at her a second time, her threw his boot at her. His boot wascovered in mud, and that mud said a lot about Mr. Cruncherís other ways ofmaking money. While he usually came home after banking hours with clean boots,he often went out again at night, and when he woke up the next morning his bootswould be covered with clay.             

ìWhat,î said Mr. Cruncher, after he missed her with the boot. ìWhat are you upto, you aggravator?î            

ìI was only praying.î             

ìPraying! Youíre a nice woman! What are you doing throwing yourself down onyour knees and praying against me?î            

ìIím not praying against you. I was praying for you.î            

ìNo, you werenít. And if you were, I wonít be made a fool of.î Cruncher thenspoke to their son. ìYour motherís a nice woman, Young Jerry,î he saidsarcastically, ìpraying that your father will fail. Youíve got a devoted mother,very religious, kneeling down and praying that the food will be taken away fromher only child.î            

Mr. Cruncherís son, who hadnít gotten dressed yet, turned away from hismother. He did not like the fact that his mother was praying that his food betaken away.             

ìAnd how important do you think your prayers are, youarrogant woman?î asked Mr. Cruncher. ìHow much do you thinktheyíre worth?î            

ìThey come from the heart, Jerry. Theyíre only worth what they mean tome.î            

ìTheyíre not worth much, then,î said Mr. Cruncher. ìNo matter what theyíreworth, I wonít have you praying against me. I canít afford it. Iím not going tobe made unlucky by your sneaking around. If you must throw yourself down on yourknees and pray, pray for your husband and child, not    against them. If my wife and this boyís mother didnít knowhow to use magic, I might have made some money last week instead of being cursedinto having the worst of luck. B-u-u-ust me!î said Mr. Cruncher, who had beengetting dressed all this time. ìIf I havenít had the worst luck this week thatany honest businessman ever had. Get dressed, Young Jerry, and watch your motherwhile I clean my boots. If you see her get down on her knees to pray again, letme know. Iím warning you,î he said to his wife, ìI wonít be abused this way. Iímweak, Iím tired, Iím sore, and yet I havenít made any money for all my troubles.I suspect that youíve been praying all day and night to keep me from making anymoney, and I wonít put up with it, you aggravator! What do you say aboutthat?î            

Muttering other phrases like ìOh, yes! Youíre a religious woman, arenít you?You would never go against the best interests of your husband and child, wouldyou? Not you!î and making other such sarcastic comments, Mr. Cruncher went aboutcleaning his boots and getting ready for work. Meanwhile, his son, whose hairwas slightly less spiked than his fatherís and whose eyes were close togetherlike his fatherís, watched his mother as he had been told. He kept surprisingher by jumping out of his little bedroom where he was washing up and yelling,ìYou were about to kneel down and pray, Mother. Hey! Father!î and then, afteryelling out this false warning, jumping back into the other room again with agrin.             

Mr. Cruncher was still in a bad mood when he came to eat breakfast. He wasparticularly angry when Mrs. Cruncher said grace.            

ìWhat are you up to now, aggravator! Are you at it again?î             

His wife explained to him that she was only asking for a blessing.            

ìDonít do it!î said Mr. Cruncher while he looked around, as if he expected hiswifeís prayers to make the loaf of bread on the table disappear. ìIím not goingto let myself be blessed out of house and home. I wonít let you bless my foodright off of my table. Keep quiet!î            

Blurry-eyed and sullen, as if he had been up all night at a party that hadended badly, Jerry Cruncher ate his breakfast anxiously, growling over it likean animal. Around nine oíclock he calmed himself down and, making himself asrespectable and professional looking as he could, went out to start his day.        

You could barely call his work skilled labor, even though he liked to describehimself as an ìhonest businessman.î His only equipment was a wooden stool madefrom a broken chair. His son, young Jerry, carried the stool every morning as hewalked at his fatherís side and placed it under the bank window closest toTemple Bar. He would take a handful of straw from the first vehicle that passedand use it to keep his feet warm and dry, and that was where Mr. Cruncherworked. Here at his position, Mr. Cruncher was as familiar to the people inFleet Street and the Temple Bar area as Temple Bar itself.             

Jerry took up his position there at 8:45 this windy March morning, just intime to tip his three-cornered hat to the oldest clerks of Tellsonís Bank asthey came into work. His son stood next to him when he wasnít wandering throughTemple Bar looking for boys who were smaller than himself to pick on. Jerry andyoung Jerry, looking very much like each other, silently watched the morningtraffic on Fleet Street. Their heads were as close together as each oneís eyeswere, making them look like a pair of monkeys. Increasing their resemblance tomonkeys was the fact that Jerry chewed on and spat out pieces of straw. His sonwatched him, and everything else on Fleet Street, carefully.            

One of the regular messengers that worked in the bank poked his head out thedoor and said:            

ìWe need a porter!î            

ìHooray, Father! Hereís an early job to start the day with!î            

Having sent his father off, young Jerry sat on the stool, looked at the strawhis father had been chewing on, and thought.            

ìMy fatherís fingers are always so rusty!î mumbled young Jerry. ìWhere does heget all that iron rust on him? He doesnít get any iron rust on him working hereat the bank!î            

ìYou know the Old Baileystreet in London where criminals were tried and imprisonedOld Bailey, donít you?î one of the bankís oldest clerks asked Jerry.        

ìYe-es, sir,î answered Jerry, warily. ìI do know the Old Bailey.î            

ìI thought so. And you know Mr. Lorry.î            

ìI know Mr. Lorry much better than I know or ever wish to know the Old Bailey.Iím an honest businessman.î He answered as if he were a reluctant witnessstanding trial.            

ìGood. Go find the door where they bring the witnesses in, and show thedoorman this note for Mr. Lorry. He will let you in.î            

ìInto the courtroom, sir?î            

ìYes. Into the courtroom.î             

Mr. Cruncher narrowed his eyes, as if his eyes were asking each other, ìWhatdo you think about this?î             

ìShould I wait for him in court, sir?î Mr. Cruncher asked.            

ìIíll tell you. The doorman will pass your note to Mr. Lorry. Get Mr. Lorryísattention and let him know that youíre there. Then wait there until he needsyou.î            

ìIs that all, sir?î            

ìThatís all. He wants a messenger nearby. Your job is to let him know thatyouíre there if he needs you.î            

The elderly clerk folded and addressed the note. Mr. Cruncher watched him insilence until he had sealed the paper. Then he said:            

ìI guess theyíre trying people for forgery this morning?î            

ìNo. Treason!î            

ìThatís punishable by quarteringdismembering a body into four partsquartering,î said Jerry. ìHow barbaric!î            

ìItís the law,î answered the old clerk, surprised at this comment. ìThe law isthe law.î             

ìItís a harsh law. Itís bad enough to kill him, but itís worse to torture him,sir.î            

ìNonsense,î answered the old clerk. ìItís a good law. My advice is to takecare of your own health, my friend, and let the law take care of itself.î            

ìItís this damp weather, sir, that affects my health,î said Jerry. ìMy joboften requires me to be out in wet weather.î            

ìWell, we all have different ways of earning a living. Some of us have wetjobs and some of us have dry jobs. Here is the letter. Get going.î            

Jerry took the letter. He bowed respectfully to the man, but under his breathhe muttered, ìYouíre a mean, skinny old man.î Jerry told his son where he wasgoing and left for the Old Bailey.             

In those days they hanged people at Tyburn, so Newgatewhere they hanged people in Dickensís timeNewgate didnít have a bad reputation yet. But the jail was a terrible place, where all kinds of evil and wickedness happened. Diseases were spread throughout the jail. Sometimes the diseases were carried by the prisoners into the courtroom and spread to the Lord Chief Justice himself. There were times when the judge became deathly ill while he was sentencing a man to death and even died before the prisoner was executed. For everyone else, the Old Bailey was a like a deadly inn, where travelers left in carts and coaches on their way to their deaths. They would travel some two and a half miles through the public streets where people would line up to watch them pass. The Old Bailey was also famous for wise,old traditions like the pillorya device used for public punishment; it included holes for confining a prisoners head and wristspillory and the whipping post. Watching a person being whipped could make the observer feel hardened and less human. The Old Bailey was also famousfor blood moneypaying a witness to provide evidence that leads to a personís convictionblood money, another wise, old tradition that led to some of the worst crimes ever committed. All in all, the Old Bailey illustrated the saying, ìthe way something has always been done must be the right way.î Unfortunately, this lazy saying also implied that any different way must be wrong.            

Jerry Cruncher walked through the crowd like a man who was used to movingquietly. He found the door he was looking for and handed his letter through it.In those days people paid to see the trials at the Old Bailey, just like theypaid to go to the theater or to visit the Bedlam insane asylum. The Old Bailey,however, cost much more, so the doors were well guarded. The only exception wasthe door through which the criminals entered, which was kept wide open.             

After a few moments, the doorman reluctantly opened the door a little way andallowed Mr. Jerry Cruncher to squeeze into the courtroom.            

ìWhat case is this?î Jerry whispered to the man next to him.            

ìNothing yet.î            

ìWhat case is next?î            

ìThe treason case.î            

ìThe one where theyíre going to quarter the man?î            

ìYep!î answered the man excitedly. ìTheyíll hang him for a while, and thentheyíll take him down, cut him open, disembowel him, and burn his intestinesright in front of his eyes so he can watch. Then theyíll cut his head off andcut his body into four pieces. Thatís the punishment.î             

ìIf they decide heís guilty, you mean?î asked Jerry.            

ìOh, theyíll decide heís guilty,î said the other man. ìDonít you worry aboutthat.î            

Mr. Cruncher noticed the doorkeeper, who was moving toward Mr. Lorry with thenote in his hand. Mr. Lorry was sitting at a table with several gentlemen inwigs. Sitting near them were the prisonerís lawyer, who had a big pile of papersin front of him, and another man who had his hands in his pockets and keptlooking at the ceiling. Jerry got Mr. Lorryís attention by coughing loudly andgesturing a few times. Mr. Lorry, who had stood up to look for him, nodded toJerry and then sat down again.             

ìWhatís he got to do with this case?î the man next to Jerryasked about Mr. Lorry.            

ìI have no idea,î said Jerry.             

ìWhat do you have to do with it, if I may ask?î            

ìI donít know that either,î said Jerry.            

The judge entered and everyone in the court got settled. Jerry and the manstopped talking. Everyone focused their attention on the dock, where theprisoner was to stand trial. Two jailers who had been standing there went out ofthe room. They came back with the prisoner and brought him to the bar.             

Everyone stared at him except for the wigged gentleman who was still staringat the ceiling. People peeked around pillars and corners to get a glimpse ofhim. Those in the back rows stood up for a better look. People standing on theground floor stood on their tiptoes or tried to push themselves up on otherpeopleís shoulders. Jerry, noticeable by his spiked hair, stood among them. Hisbreath smelled of the beer he had drunk on his way there. It mixed with thesmells of gin, tea, and coffee that came from the breaths of the other people inthe crowd. The breath of the crowd steamed up the windows of the courthouse.        

They were all staring at a young man about twenty-five years old, tall andgood-looking, with sunburned cheeks and dark eyes. He looked like a younggentleman. He was dressed plainly in black or very dark gray. His hair was longand dark and was tied in a ribbon at the back of his neck, more to keep it outof his face than for the sake of fashion. Although he was sunburned, his cheekswere pale from nervousness. Otherwise, he appeared confident. He bowed to thejudge and stood quietly.             

The way the crowd ogled the man was not flattering for the human race. If hissentence wasnít such a horrible oneóif there were any chance that he would bespared from any of the terrible things that were set to happen to himópeoplewould have lost interest. People had come to see the body that was soon to behorribly mutilated, butchered, and torn to pieces. Whatever these people toldthemselves as to why they were there, the truth was they were there out of amorbid fascination.             

The judge began: ìSilence in the court! Yesterday Charles Darnay pleaded ënotguiltyí to the charge of treason. He has been charged with betraying England andour king by helping King Louis of France in the wars against England on manyoccasions. He is charged with traveling between England and France and tellingKing Louis what forces we planned to send to Canada and North America.î Jerry,to his satisfaction, soon figured out that Charles Darnay was the man standingtrial, that they were swearing in the jury, and that the attorney general wasabout to speak.             

The prisoner didnít flinch or act out in any way, although he knew that everyperson in the courtroom was already picturing him being hanged, beheaded, andcut into pieces. He stood quietly, paying close attention to the courtproceedings. He rested his hands on the slab of wood in front of him. He was socalm that he didnít disturb the vinegar and herbs, which had been scatteredthroughout the courtroom to protect everyone against disease.             

A mirror hung over the prisonerís head to reflect light down onto him. Overthe years this mirror had reflected the images of many poor and wicked prisonerswho had eventually been put to death. If that mirror were ever able to sendthose reflections back out, the courtroom would have been filled with ghosts.The prisoner may have thought about how disgraceful it was to have this mirrorthere. He shifted and a shaft of light shining across his face made him look up.When he saw his reflection, he blushed and brushed the herbs off of the bar infront of him.             

As he made this gesture, he turned his face to his left. His eyes fell upontwo people sitting near the judgeís bench. His expression changed so much whenhe saw them that everyone who was watching turned to look.             

The two people were a young lady a little older than twenty years old and agentleman who was apparently her father. He was a remarkable-looking man withwhite hair and an indescribable intensity in his face. This intense expressionmade him look like an old man. But when the expression left his face, as it hadnow while he talked to his daughter, he looked handsome and in the prime of hislife.             

His daughter sat arm in arm with her father. Her fear and pity for theprisoner had made her pull close to him. The expression on her forehead revealedher compassion for the prisoner. This expression was so heartbreaking that itmoved even those people who had had no pity for the prisoner. The crowdwhispered to one another, ìWho are they?î            

Jerry, who had been observing the scene while he sucked the rust off of hisfingers, leaned in to hear who they were. The crowd around him had passed thequestion forward to the person closest to the two people. The answer was slowlypassed back until it got to Jerry:            

ìThey are witnesses.î            

ìFor which side?î asked Jerry.             

ìAgainst.î            

ìAgainst which side?î            

ìAgainst the prisoner.î            

The judge turned to look at the two witnesses and called them to the stand.Then he leaned back in his chair and looked at the prisoner. The attorneygeneral stood to state his case, to prove the man guilty and send him to hisdeath.            

The attorney general told the jury that, although the prisoner was a youngman, he had been involved in treasonous activities for many years. It wasnít asif he had committed treason for the first time that day, or the day before, oreven the year before. He had been traveling between France and England for quitea long time on secret business. If traitorous acts ever succeeded (which luckilythey never did), he might have never been caught. But Fate had caused a brave,honest man to investigate this man and pass the information on to theauthorities. This good and patriotic man, with the most noble attitude, would bebrought before the jury. The attorney general said that the man had once been afriend of the prisoner. But once he had learned of his evil doings, he decidedto turn his friend in. He said that if statues were built in Britain to honorgreat citizens, as they were in ancient Greece and Rome, then there would surelybe a statue erected of this man. Unfortunately, though, this was not done inEngland. He told the jury that virtue, which poets write about, was contagious.(He said the jurors were sure to know the poems by hearts, but judging by theirlooks, the jury didnít.) The most contagious of virtues was patriotism, or loveof oneís country. This man was a prime example of a patriot, and just talkingabout him was an honor. His patriotism led the prisonerís servant to go throughhis masterís desk drawers and pockets, and to look though his papers. Theattorney general was ready to hear others discredit this servant for betrayinghis master, but he personally believed him to be a better person than his ownbrothers and sisters, and he respected him more than his own mother and father.He advised the jury to think similarly of the servant. The attorney generalexplained that the testimony from these two men, along with the documents theyhad discovered, would prove that the prisoner had had lists of the strength andlocation of British forces, both at sea and on land, and that he had given thisinformation to the enemy. He explained that these lists were not in theprisonerís handwriting but that this only helped the prosecution because itproved that he had been cautious. They would prove that he had been passing thisinformation for five years, and had already started to do so a few weeks beforethe first battle between British troops and colonists in America. For thesereasons, the loyal, responsible citizens of the jury had no choice but to findthe prisoner guilty and sentence him to death, whether they wanted to or not.The members of the jury, as well as their wives and children, could never sleepsoundly again unless the jurors sentenced the prisoner to have his head choppedoff. The attorney general ended by demanding that they find him guilty in thename of everything good and decent, and he said he already considered theprisoner as good as dead.             

When the attorney general finished, the crowd started to buzz with excitement,like a cloud of flies, in anticipation of the prisonerís death. When the noisedied down, the ideal patriot the attorney general had described entered thewitness box.             

The solicitor general, following the attorney generalís lead, examined thewitness: a gentleman named John Barsad. He described himself exactly as theattorney general had described him. In fact, his description was almost toosimilar. After he had been examined, he would have modestly gotten down from thewitness box. But the wigged gentleman with the stack of papers, who was seatednext to Mr. Lorry, stopped him. The other wigged gentleman, sitting across fromhim, was still staring at the ceiling.             

The man asked John Barsad if he had ever been a spy himself. No, Barsadanswered indignantly. How did he make his living? He made his living off of hisproperty. Where was his property? He didnít quite remember. What was thisproperty? No oneís business. Had he inherited it? Yes, he had. From whom? Adistant relative. Very distant? Yes, very distant. Had he ever been in prison?Of course not. He had never been to debtorís prison? He didnít see what that hasto do with it. So heíd never been to debtorís prison? He asked that the questionbe repeated. Never been to debtorís prison? Yes. How many times? Two or threetimes. Not five or six times? Maybe. Whatís your profession? I am a gentleman.Have you been ever been kicked in a fight? Maybe. Often? No. Ever been kickeddown a flight of stairs? Of course not. Once, though, someone kicked me at thetop of a staircase and I happened to fall down the stairs on my own. Were youkicked because youíd been caught cheating at dice? Thatís what the drunken liarwho kicked me said, but it wasnít true. You swear it wasnít true? Definitely.Ever make money by cheating at gambling? Never. Ever make money by gambling? Nomore than other gentlemen. Ever borrow money from the prisoner? Yes. Ever payhim back? No. Wasnít your familiarity with the prisoner actually very limited,created by you deliberately bumping into him in coaches, inns, and ships? No.Are you sure you saw the prisoner with these lists? Iím sure. You didnít knowanything else about these lists? No. You didnít get them yourself, for instance?No. Do you expect to get anything in return for testifying against him? No.Youíre not employed by the British government to entrap people? Of course not.Or to do anything else? No. You swear? Iíll swear it over and over again. Youhave no motives for doing this other than love for your country? Nonewhatsoever.             

The examination of the trusted servant, Roger Cly, went quickly. He hadstarted working for the prisoner four years earlier. He met the prisoner on theboat to Calais and had asked him if he wanted a servant. The prisoner gave him ajob. He hadnít offered to work for the man for freeósuch a thing had neveroccurred to him. Shortly afterward he had become suspicious of the prisoner andstarted watching him closely. He had often seen lists, similar to the ones givenas evidence, in the prisonerís pockets while he was arranging his clothes. Hehad taken these lists out of the drawers of the prisonerís desk. He had not putthem there himself. He had seen the prisoner show the same lists to Frenchgentlemen in Calais and Boulogne. He loved his country and couldnít stand to seesuch treachery, so he told the authorities. He denied that he had once beensuspected of stealing a silver teapot. He had once been accused of stealing amustard pot, but it was only silver plated, not solid silver. He had known theother witness for seven or eight years. That was just a coincidence and not atall strange. He also didnít think it was strange that his only motive for givingevidence was pure patriotism, like the other witness. He was a loyal Britishsubject and hoped there were many like him.            

There was another buzz in the courtroom, and the attorney general called Mr.Jarvis Lorry to the stand.             

ìMr. Jarvis Lorry, are you a clerk at Tellsonís Bank?î            

ìI am.î            

ìOn a certain Friday night in November 1775, did your job require that youtake the mail coach from London to Dover?             

ìIt did.î            

ìWere there any other passengers in the coach?î            

ìTwo other passengers.î            

ìDid they get out of the coach at some point during the night?î            

ìYes, they did.î            

ìMr. Lorry, look at the prisoner. Was he one of those two passengers?î            

ìI donít know.î            

ìDoes he resemble either of the two passengers?î            

ìBoth of them were bundled up, it was dark, and we all kept to ourselves, so Icanít be sure if he looked like one of the passengers or not.î            

ìMr. Lorry, imagine the prisoner wrapped up like those two passengers. Isthere anything about his build or height that would make you think that he was    not one of them?î            

ìNo.î            

ìMr. Lorry, you cannot say for sure that he was not one of those twomen?î            

ìNo.î            

ìSo youíre saying he might have been one of them?î            

ìYes. Except that I remember them both being afraid of thieves, like I was,and the prisoner doesnít look like a man whoís afraid of anything.î            

ìDid you ever see someone pretend to be afraid, Mr. Lorry?î            

ìI certainly have.î            

ìMr. Lorry, look at the prisoner again. Have you ever seen him before?î            

ìI have.î            

ìWhen?î            

ìI was coming back from France a few days afterward. The prisoner got on boardour ship at Calais and came back to England with me.î             

ìWhat time did he come on board?î            

ìA little after midnight.î            

ìIn the middle of the night. Was he the only passenger that came on board solate?î            

ìYes. He happened to be the only one.î            

ìForget about whether he ëhappenedí to be the only one. Was he the onlypassenger to come on board in the middle of the night?î            

ìYes, he was.î            

ìWere you traveling alone, Mr. Lorry, or were you with someone?î            

ìI was with two other people. A gentleman and a lady. They are here in thecourtroom.î            

ìThey are here. Did you speak with the prisoner?             

ìHardly. The weather was stormy, and the sea was rough. I was lying on thesofa for almost the entire trip.î            

ìMiss Manette!î the attorney general said.            

The young woman, whom everyone had been watching earlier, stood up, and thecrowd turned to look at her. Her father stood up with her and kept his handlinked through her arm.             

ìMiss Manette, take a look at the prisoner.î            

To look at such a young, beautiful woman with such pity in her eyes was harderfor the prisoner than the stares of the entire crowd. He couldnít stand stillwhile looking at her, knowing he was about to die and knowing that everyone waswatching him. He brushed the herbs in front of him into little lines, like bedsof flowers in a garden. His lips trembled as he tried to steady his breathing.The crowd started to buzz again.             

ìMiss Manette, have you seen the prisoner before?î            

ìYes, sir.î            

ìWhere?î            

ìOn board the ship Mr. Lorry just mentioned. At the same time.î            

ìYou are the young woman Mr. Lorry referred to?î            

ìOh! Unfortunately, I am.î            

ìJust answer the questions simply,î the judge said angrily, cutting off hercompassionate voice. ìDonít comment on them.î            

ìMiss Manette, did you talk to the prisoner at all during the journey acrossthe Channel?î            

ìYes, sir.î            

ìDescribe the conversation.î            

The courtroom was silent as she began quietly: ìWhen the gentleman came onboardóî            

ìBy ëgentleman,í do you mean the prisoner?î asked the judge, frowning.             

ìYes, my lord.î            

ìThen say ëthe prisoner.íî            

ìWhen the prisoner came on board, he noticed that my father was very tired andweak.î She looked at her father lovingly as he stood beside her. ìMy father wasin such bad condition that I was afraid to take him inside, and I made a bed forhim on the deck near the cabin steps. I sat beside him taking care of him. Wewere the only four passengers on board that night. The prisoner was kind enoughto suggest a better way to shield my father from the wind and weather. I had notknown how to do it since I didnít understand how the wind would blow once we hadleft the harbor. The prisoner did it for me. He was very gentle and kind towardmy father, and Iím sure he was sincere. That is how we started talking.î             

ìLet me interrupt you for a moment. Did he come on board alone?î            

ìNo.î            

ìHow many people were with him?î            

ìTwo French gentlemen.î            

ìDid they speak together?î            

ìThey spoke together until the very last moment, when the two French gentlementook their boat back to shore.î            

ìDid they pass any papers between them? Papers similar to these lists?î            

ìThey passed some papers between them, but I donít know what theywere.î            

ìWere they the same shape and size as these papers?î            

ìThey might have been, but Iím not sure. They stood close to me, whispering toeach other. They were at the top of the cabin steps, near the light of the lamp.The lamp was dim, and they spoke very quietly. I did not hear what they said. Icould only see that they were looking at some papers.î            

ìTell us about your conversation with the prisoner, Miss Manette.î            

ìBecause I was helpless, the prisoner was as open and honest with me as he waskind and helpful to my father.î She burst into tears. ìI hope that I will notrepay him today by doing him harm.î            

The courtroom buzzed with excitement.             

ìMiss Manette, everyone here, except maybe the prisoner, understands that youdo not want to give this evidence today. You know, though, that it is your dutyto do so. Please continue.î            

ìHe told me that he was traveling on business of a delicate and difficultnature that could get certain people into trouble. Because of this, he was usinga false name. He said that this business had required him to go to France onshort notice and that he might need to travel back and forth between France andEngland for a long time to come.î            

ìDid he say anything about America, Miss Manette? Be specific.î            

ìHe tried to explain to me how the conflict in America had developed. He saidthat, in his opinion, it was wrong and foolish for England to fight. He jokedthat George Washington might someday be as famous a man in history as EnglandísKing George III. But he didnít mean any harm by this. He was only joking to passthe time.î             

A crowd will always mimic the expression on the face of an actor in a playthey are watching. Miss Manetteís forehead was wrinkled up as she gave herevidence, waited for the judge to write down what she said, and watched thelawyers to see how they would react. All the people in the crowd had the sameexpression on their foreheads, as if they were mirrors reflecting Miss Manette.The judge looked up, angered by the comment about George Washington.             

The attorney general signaled to the judge that he needed to call the youngwomanís father to testify. The judge agreed, and Dr. Manette was called to thestand.             

ìDr. Manette, look at the prisoner. Have you ever seen him before?î            

ìYes, once. He came to my home in London about three or three and a half yearsago.î            

ìCan you identify him as the man you met on board the boat from Calais, orverify that he had this conversation with your daughter?î            

ìI canít do either, sir.î            

ìIs there some reason why?î            

ìThere is,î he answered quietly.            

ìDid you spend a long time in prison in France, Dr. Manette, without a trialor even being officially accused?î            

ìA long imprisonment,î he answered in a tone that provoked pity.            

ìHad you just been released on the night in question?î            

ìThatís what they tell me.î            

ìDo you remember that night?î            

ìNot at all. I donít remember anything from a long periodóI canít even say howlong. Iíve forgotten everything from the time when I was making shoes in prisonto when I found myself living in London with my daughter. I began to recognizeher when I started to get my senses back. I have no memory of how it happened,though.î             

The attorney general sat down, and so did Dr. Manette and his daughter.        

An important fact then came up in the case. The attorney general wanted toprove that the prisoner rode with some unknown accomplice in the Dover mailcoach that Friday night in November five years earlier and got out sometime inthe night. From there he backtracked about twelve miles or more to a militarypost and dockyard, where he gathered information. They called a witness who saidhe saw the prisoner around that time waiting for someone in the coffee room ofthe hotel in the town, near the military post and dockyard. The prisoneríslawyer cross-examined this witness and learned nothing except that the witnesshad never seen the prisoner before this time. Then, the wigged gentleman who hadbeen staring at the ceiling the whole time wrote a word or two on a small scrapof paper, crumpled it up, and threw it at the prisonerís lawyer. The lawyeropened the piece of paper, paused, and looked curiously at the prisoner.             

ìYouíre sure you saw the prisoner?î he asked the witness.            

The witness said he was sure.             

ìHave you ever seen anyone who looked like the prisoner?î            

ìNot so much like him that I could confuse the two,î said the witness.             

ìLook closely at my esteemed friend over there,î he said, pointing to the manwho had tossed the paper. ìNow look closely at the prisoner. Do they look likeeach other?î            

Except for the fact that the friend had a sloppy, unkempt appearance, the twomen looked enough alike that the witness and everyone in the courtroom weresurprised to notice it. The judge asked the man to take off his wig, and once hedid they looked even more alike. The judge asked Mr. Stryver, the prisoneríslawyer, if they were going to try Mr. Carton, the other man, for treason. Mr.Stryver answered that no, they would not. But he would ask the witness that, ifthis could happen once, could it have happened another time, and if he wouldhave been so confident if this resemblance had been pointed out sooner. As aresult, the credibility of the witness was completely ruined and his testimonybecame useless.             

By this time, Mr. Cruncher had eaten a lot of rust off of his fingers whilefollowing the evidence. Now he listened as Mr. Stryver, the prisonerís lawyer,tried to convince the jury of the prisonerís innocence. He told them that theìpatriot,î Barsad, was actually a hired spy and a traitor. He said that he wasbeing paid to help convict the man and sentence him to death, and that Barsadwas one of the worst scoundrels since Judas, who he even looked like. He saidthat the prisonerís supposedly virtuous servant, Cly, was actually a friend andpartner of Barsadís and as bad a man as he was. He said that Barsad and Cly hadchosen the prisoner as their victim because he often traveled between France andEngland on family business. This business was so delicate that he could notdiscuss it, even at the risk of death, for the sake of protecting his lovedones. He explained that the evidence the young woman had so reluctantly givenadded up to nothing but small talk between two strangers. His comment aboutGeorge Washington was so outrageous that it could only have been a sick joke. Hesaid the attorney general was trying to capitalize on publicís hatred and fear,and it would be a shame for the government to rule on this basis. Still, hesaid, the evidence didnít prove anything. It was the type of false evidence thatwas often seen in cases where people were accused of committing crimes againstthe state. At that point the judge interrupted and said that he could not standto hear such offensive comments.             

Mr. Stryver then called a few witnesses. Mr. Cruncher listened while theattorney general told the jury that everything Mr. Stryver had told them waswrong. Barsad and Cly were better men than he had originally thought, and theprisoner was a much worse man than he had originally thought. Finally, the judgehimself spoke. He said some things in favor of the prisoner, and other thingsagainst him. Overall, his remarks made the prisoner appear to be guilty.            

At this point, the jury gathered to discuss their verdict. The courtroombuzzed with conversation.             

Mr. Carton, who had been staring at the ceiling for some time, didnít move orchange his expression, even amid the excitement. Meanwhile, Mr. Stryver piled upthe papers in front of him and whispered with the people near him. Occasionallyhe glanced anxiously at the jury. The crowd milled about. The judge got up fromhis seat and paced back and forth on his platform. But Carton sat there, leaningback with his torn gown half on, his messy wig placed sloppily on his head, hishands in his pockets, and his eyes turned to the ceiling. There was somethingreckless and dishonorable about him. He was so disheveled that he didnít look asmuch like the prisoner as he had before, when he had been serious for a moment.Many in the crowd now said that they didnít look so much alike after all. Mr.Cruncher commented to the man next to him, ìI bet he doesnít get any work as alawyer. He doesnít look like the type to get any, does he?î            

But Mr. Carton was paying closer attention to the scene than it appeared. WhenMiss Manette dropped her head onto her fatherís chest, he was the first personto say loudly, ìOfficer! Assist that young woman. Help the gentleman take herout of the room. Canít you see sheís about to faint?î            

The crowd was very sympathetic to her and her father as they left thecourtroom. It had apparently been very stressful for him to think back on histime in prison. The questioning had clearly upset him, and that thoughtful orbrooding expression that made him look older had been on his face ever since. Ashe was leaving, the foreman spoke on behalf of the jury, who were once againfacing forward.             

The jury had not come to a decision and wanted to go away to deliberatefurther. The judge, perhaps thinking about the prisonerís comment about GeorgeWashington, was surprised. But he signaled that they could go away under carefulsupervision, then he left the courtroom himself. The trial had lasted all dayand the lamps in the court were being lit. A rumor spread that the jury would bedeliberating for a long time. The spectators took a break and left thecourtroom, and the prisoner moved to the back of the dock and sat down.             

Mr. Lorry, who had left the courtroom with Miss Manette and her father, nowcame back in and motioned to Jerry. Jerry could now get near him easily sincethe crowd had left.             

ìJerry, you can go get something to eat, but stay close by. Iím sure you willhear when the jury comes in. Get back here as soon as they do. I want you totake the verdict back to the bank. Youíre the fastest messenger I know, andyouíll get back to Temple Bar much faster than I can.î            

Mr. Lorry gave him a shilling, and Jerry agreed to deliver the message. Atthat moment, Mr. Carton came up to Mr. Lorry and tapped him on the arm.            

ìHow is the young lady?î            

ìSheís very upset, but her father is comforting her. She feels better now thatshe is out of the courtroom.î            

ìIíll tell the prisoner. It wouldnít be proper if people saw a respectablebanker like you speaking to him in public.î            

Mr. Lorry blushed as if he had thought of this himself. Mr. Carton went overto the bar where the prisoner was sitting. The exit was in the same direction,and Jerry, with his spiked hair, followed behind him, watching and listeningintently.             

ìMr. Darnay!î said Mr. Carton.             

The prisoner immediately stepped forward.            

ìIím sure you are anxious to hear how the witness, Miss Manette, is doing. Sheis doing very well. She got through the worst of it.î            

ìI am very sorry that I caused her distress. Could you tell her for me, withmy sincerest apologies?î            

ìYes, I will tell her if you want me to.î            

Mr. Cartonís attitude was so casual that it was almost rude. He stood there,partly facing away from the prisoner, leaning with his elbow against thebar.            

ìI would like that. Thank you.î            

ìWhat verdict do you expect, Mr. Darnay?î Carton asked, still only partlyfacing him.            

ìGuilty.î            

ìItís smart of you to expect that, as itís the most likely. But I think theirlong deliberation could work in your favor.î            

Jerry didnít hear any more of their conversation, since he wasnít allowed tohang around. He left the two men, who looked so much like each other but were sodifferent in their behavior, standing next to each other and reflected in themirror above them.            

An hour and a half went by slowly. The scoundrels in the crowd passed the timeeating and drinking. Jerry, seated uncomfortably on a bench after eating dinner,had dozed off, when the murmuring crowd swept him up and carried him with theminto the courtroom.             

ìJerry! Jerry!î Mr. Lorry was already calling for him when he arrived.             

ìIím here, sir! Itís a fight to get back through this crowd. Here I am, sir!î        

Mr. Lorry handed a piece of paper to him through the crowd. ìQuick! Do youhave it?î            

ìYes, sir.î            

The word Acquitted had been quickly scribbled down on thepaper.            

ìIf you had sent the message ëBrought back to lifeí again I would haveunderstood it this time,î muttered Jerry.             

Jerry didnít have time to say or think anything else until he was out of theOld Bailey. The crowd came pouring out of the courtroom so quickly that theynearly knocked him over, and their loud buzz spread into the streets as if theywere flies in search of other carrion.            

The last few spectators were leaving the dim corridors of the courthouse. Dr.Manette and his daughter, Lucie, as well as Mr. Lorry, the solicitor for thedefense, and the defense lawyer, Mr. Stryver, gathered around Mr. CharlesDarnay, who had just been released. They all congratulated him on his escapefrom the death penalty.            

In brighter light it would have been difficult to tell that the intelligentlooking Dr. Manette was the same man who had been a shoemaker in the attic inParis. People couldnít help but look twice at him, even when they had not heardhis low, sad voice or seen the dazed absentmindedness that overcame him at timeswithout any apparent reason. A single reminder of his time in prison, like whathad happened at the trial, could send him into depression. But it could alsoarise on its own, and send him into a gloomy state of mind. These mood changeswere completely surprising to people who did not know his troubled history. Itwas as if the shadow of the Bastillea large prison in ParisBastille were on him, even though the building was threehundred miles away.             

Only his daughter could bring him back from this melancholy brooding. She wasthe one thing that connected his past, before his imprisonment, to his present.The sound of her voice, the look on her face, or the touch of her hand almostalways made him feel better. There had a few times when she hadnít been able tohelp him, but these instances were rare and she felt they were now over.             

Mr. Darnay kissed her hand passionately and gratefully, and thanked Mr.Stryver warmly. Mr. Stryver was not much older than thirty, but he looked fifty.He was fat, loud, red, and crude. He had a way of shoving himself, morally andphysically, into groups and conversations, just as he was shoving his way up inthe world.            

Mr. Stryver still wore his wig and gown, and he stood in front of Mr. Darnayin such a way that Mr. Lorry was edged out of the conversation entirely. ìI amhappy I represented you honorably, Mr. Darnay,î said Mr. Stryver. ìIt was avillainous case they had against you, but that doesnít mean they couldnít havesucceeded.î            

ìI am indebted to your for life, in two senses of the word,î said Mr. Darnay,shaking his hand.             

ìI did my best for you, Mr. Darnay, though I only did as well as any other manwould have.î            

It was obvious that someone was expected to say, ìYou did much better than anyother could have,î so Mr. Lorry said it, hoping to squeeze himself back into theconversation.            

ìDo you think so?î asked Mr. Stryver. ìWell! Youíve been here all day and youought to know. Youíre a businessman, too.î            

Mr. Stryver had now pushed Mr. Lorry back into the group, just as he hadpushed him out before. ìAnd as a businessman,î said Mr. Lorry, ìI will ask Dr.Manette to break up this conversation and order us all to go home. Miss Lucielooks ill, Mr. Darnay has had a terrible day, and everyone is exhausted.î            

ìSpeak for yourself, Mr. Lorry,î said Stryver. ìI have work to do tonight.Speak for yourself.î            

ìI speak for myself, for Mr. Darnay, and for Miss Lucie,î answered Mr. Lorry.ìDonít you think I can speak for all of us, Miss Lucie?î he asked her, glancingat her father.            

Dr. Manette was looking at Darnay strangely. It was an intense look that grewinto a frown of dislike and distrust, mixed with fear. With this expression onhis face his mind had wandered off.             

ìFather.î said Lucie, gently taking his hand.            

The look faded from his face, and he turned to look at her.            

ìShall we go home, Father?î            

ìYes,î he answered with a long sigh.             

Mr. Darnay had told them that he would not be released that night, so thegroup went their separate ways. Almost all of the lamps in the hallways had beenput out, and the iron gates were noisily being shut. The courthouse would beempty until another crowd arrived the next morning hoping to see people hanged,whipped, branded, or sent to the stocks. Lucie stepped outside and walkedbetween her father and Mr. Darnay. They called a coach, and then Lucie and herfather got in and left.             

Mr. Stryver had left them in the hallway to push his way back to the changingroom. A man who had not been in their group and hadnít spoken a word to any ofthem was leaning against the wall in the shadows. He had silently followed themout and had watched Dr. Manette and his daughter drive away in the coach. Now hecame up to where Mr. Lorry and Mr. Darnay were standing on the street.            

ìSo, Mr. Lorry! Respected businessmen can now be seen talking publicly withMr. Darnay again?î said Mr. Carton.            

Nobody had mentioned the role Mr. Carton had played in the events of the day.Nobody had noticed him there. He wasnít wearing his robe anymore and lookedworse than he had in the courtroom.             

ìIf you knew how conflicted businessmen become when they are caught betweendoing the right thing and the professional thing, you would find it funny, Mr.Darnay,î said Mr. Carton.            

Mr. Lorry blushed and said in a friendly manner, ìYou have said that before,sir. We men of business, who work for a company, cannot think only of ourselves.We have to think of whatís best for the company.î            

ìI know, I know,î answered Mr. Carton casually. ìDonít get upset, Mr. Lorry.You are as good a man as any, Iím sure. Better, I might say.î            

ìReally, sir,î continued Mr. Lorry, ignoring him. ìI donít know what you haveto do with any of this. Excuse me for saying so but, as a much older man thanyourself, I really donít think itís any of your business.î            

ìBusiness! I have no business,î said Mr. Carton.            

ìItís a shame that you donít, sir,î said Mr. Lorry.            

ìI think so, too.î            

ìIf you did have business,î continued Mr. Lorry, ìperhaps you could go takecare of it.î            

ìLord bless you. No! I wouldnít do that,î said Mr. Carton.            

ìWell, sir!î exclaimed Mr. Lorry, angered by Cartonís casual attitude,ìbusiness is a good and respectable thing. Being a businessman sometimes meansyou have to restrain yourself from doing what you would like to do. Mr. Darnayis a kind young gentleman who understands these things. Good night, Mr. Darnay.God bless you, sir! I hope you have a prosperous, happy life in front of you. Chair!îa small carriage drawn by one horseChair!î

Mr. Lorry may have been mad at both himself and Mr. Carton, and he climbedinto the chair and headed off to Tellsonís Bank. Carton, who smelled like portwine and appeared to be a bit drunk, laughed and turned to Darnay:            

ìItís pretty odd that you and I are here together. This must be a strangenight for you, standing here alone on the street with a man who looks just likeyou.î            

ìI still donít feel like I belong to the world of the living,î answeredCharles Darnay.             

ìIím not surprised. It wasnít long ago that you were close to being put todeath. Your voice is weak.î            

ìI feel weak.î            

ìThen why donít you eat dinner? I ate dinner myself while those idiots in thejury were arguing about whether you should live or die. Let me show you theclosest good tavern.î            

Mr. Carton took his arm and led Mr. Darnay down Ludgate Hill to Fleet Streetand up a covered passageway into a tavern. They were brought into a small roomwhere Charles Darnay soon restored his strength with a simple dinner and somegood wine. Carton, still as rude as ever, sat across from him at the same tablewith his own bottle of port.             

ìDo you feel like you belong to the world of the living yet, Mr.Darnay?î            

ìIím quite disoriented, but Iím well enough to feel like I am.î            

ìYou must be very happy about that!î            

He spoke bitterly and refilled his large wine glass.             

ìAs for me,î said Mr. Carton, ìmy greatest wish is to forget that I belong tothis world. It has nothing good in store for me except this wine. And I havenothing for it. You and I are very different in that way. Actually, Iím startingto think that you and I arenít that similar after all.î            

Mr. Darnay was confused by the emotions of the day, and it felt like a dreamto be with this man who looked so much like himself, but behaved so roughly. Hedidnít know how to respond to this statement, and finally, he decided not toanswer at all.             

ìNow that youíve finished eating, Mr. Darnay,î Carton said, ìwhy donít youpropose a toast?î            

ìWhat toast?î            

ìWhy, itís on the tip of your tongue. You should know what it is. You must.Iím sure you do.î            

ìTo Miss Manette, then!î            

ìTo Miss Manette!î            

Staring into Mr. Darnayís face while he drank to the toast, Carton flung hiswine glass over his shoulder against the wall, where it shattered. Then he rangthe bell and ordered another.            

ìThatís a beautiful young lady to send away in a coach at night, Mr. Darnay!îhe said, handling his new glass.            

ìYes,î said Mr. Darnay, frowning slightly.            

ìHow does it feel to have such a beautiful young woman pity you and weep foryou? Is it worth being put on trial for your life to be the object of suchsympathy and compassion, Mr. Darnay?î            

Again Darnay didnít answer.            

ìShe was very happy to receive your message when I gave it to her. She didnítshow that she was pleased, but I think she was.î            

This comment reminded Darnay that Carton had helped him by delivering thismessage. He turned the conversation to that fact and thanked him for hishelp.            

ìI donít want or deserve any thanks,î he said casually. ìFirst of all, it wasnothing. And second, I donít even know why I did it. Let me ask you a question,Mr. Darnay.î            

ìOf course. Itís the least I could do for your favor.î            

ìDo you think that I like you?î            

ìReally, Mr. Carton,î answered Mr. Darnay, a bit flustered by the question, ìIhavenít thought much about it.î            

ìThink about it now.î            

ìYou have acted as if you liked me, but I donít think you actually do.î            

ìI donít think I do like you,î said Carton. ìIím starting to think highly ofyour intelligence.î            

ìRegardless of whether you like me, there isnít any reason why I shouldnítthank you for your help, and we should part on good terms,î said Mr. Darnay. Hegot up to ring the service bell.            

Carton answered, ìNot on your life!î Darnay rang the bell. ìDo you call useven?î Mr. Darnay answered that yes, he did. ìThen bring me another pint of thiswine, waiter, and wake me in my room at ten oíclock.î            

They paid the bill and Charles Darnay got up and wished Mr. Carton good night.Without wishing Darnay good night in return, Mr. Carton also got up and saiddefiantly, ìOne last thing, Mr. Darnay. Do you think I am drunk?î             

ìI think you have been drinking, Mr. Carton.î            

ìYou think? You know I have been drinking.î            

ìYes, I know it.î            

ìThen I will tell you why. I am unhappy and overworked, sir. I donít likeanyone in the world, and no one likes me.î            

ìIím sorry to hear that. You might have put your skills to better use.î            

ìPerhaps, Mr. Darnay. Perhaps not. Donít let your sober self get too excited.You donít know what trouble you might get yourself into. Good night!î            

When he was alone, Mr. Carton picked up the candle and went over to a mirrorhanging on the wall. He looked at himself closely in it.             

ìDo you like that man?î he mumbled to his reflection. ìWhy should you like aman who looks like you? There is nothing likable about you. You know that. Ah,youíre confused! How much youíve changed! That man reminds you of what you usedto be like and what you might have become. Thatís a good reason to like him. Ifyou traded places with him, would Miss Manette have looked at you with her blueeyes the way she looked at him? Would she have been as concerned if you had beenon trial? Come on and say it plainly. You hate that man.î            

He drank his wine to console himself. He drank it all in a few minutes andfell asleep with his head on his arms. His hair was spread out over the table,and candle wax dripped down and covered him like a winding sheeta sheet that a dead person is buried inwinding sheet.             

People drank a lot in those days. The situation is better today. The amount ofalcohol that a man back then could drink in one night and still remainrespectable would seem ridiculous to people today. Lawyers drank as much aspeople in any other profession. Mr. Stryver, who was already shoving his way tobeing very wealthy and successful, equaled his peers in drinking just as much ashe did in matters of the law.             

Mr. Stryver had been popular at the Old Bailey and at the Sessionslower criminal courtSessions, but he had startedto leave his colleagues behind as his ambition drove him forward. The Sessionsand the Old Bailey now had to summon him to get him to visit. Mr. Stryver couldbe seen every day shoving himself past these old colleagues into the view of theLord Chief Justice in the Court of Kingís Bench, like a sunflower shoving pastthe nearby flowers toward the sun.             

It was once said at the bar that although Mr. Stryver was persuasive, immoral,bold, and well prepared, he was not skilled at getting to the core of complexmatters, which is one of the most important skills a lawyer needs. He wasimproving, though. The more cases he worked on, the better he became at findingthe crux of an argument. And no matter how late he stayed up drinking withSydney Carton, he was always well prepared the next morning.             

Sydney Carton, who was lazy and unimpressive, was Mr. Stryverís greatestasset. You could have kept one of the kingís ships afloat on the amount ofliquor the two of them drank together between Hilary Term and Michaelmastwo of the four terms that made up the legal yearHilary Term and Michaelmas. If Stryver was on a case, Cartonwas there with his hands in his pockets staring at the courtroom ceiling. Theyworked on cases for the circuit court, and they stayed up drinking late into thenight. Carton could sometimes be seen stumbling back home, disheveled and drunk,in broad daylight. Finally the word got out among other lawyers that whileSydney Carton would never be a lion, he was a great jackal, and this was theservice he provided Stryver.             

ìTen oíclock, sir,î said the man at the tavern. ìTen oíclock, sir.î            

ìWhatís the matter?î asked Carton.            

ìTen oíclock, sir.î             

ìWhat do you mean? Ten oíclock at night?î            

ìYes, sir. You told me to wake you.î            

ìOh! I remember. Very well, very well.î            

After a few feeble attempts to go back to sleep, which the servant preventedby continuously stirring the fire for five minutes, Mr. Carton got up. He puthis hat on and walked out. He turned into Temple Bar, and he tried to revivehimself by walking back and forth along the street. Then he entered Stryveríshome.             

Stryverís assistant, who never assisted him at these meetings, had gone home,and Stryver opened the door himself. He had slippers on and a loose bed gown.His collar was open to be more comfortable. He had that wild, strained look inhis eyes that people of his class who drink too much have had for ages. Youcould see it in the portraits of JeffreysGeorge Jeffreys, a notorious Lord Chief Justice of EnglandJeffreys on down through every Drinking Age.             

ìYouíre a little late, Memory,î said Stryver.            

ìIím here around the usual time. Maybe Iím fifteen minutes late.î             

They went into a dirty little room, filled with books and papers, where therewas a blazing fire. A kettle was steaming on the stove, an in the middle of themess of papers, there was a table with wine, brandy, rum, sugar, and lemons.        

ìI see youíve already had a bottle of wine, Sydney.î            

ìTwo tonight, I think. Iíve been eating with todayís client. Or watching himeat. Itís all the same.î            

ìThat was an important point that you brought up about identifying Mr. Darnay.How did you think of it?î            

ìI thought that he was rather a good-looking man, and I thought I would havebeen the same kind of man, if Iíd had any luck.î            

Mr. Stryver laughed until his belly shook.             

ìYou and your luck, Sydney! Get to work, get to work.î            

Mr. Carton loosened his clothes gloomily and went into another room. He cameback with a large jug of cold water, a basin, and one or two towels. Dipping thetowels in the water and partially wringing them out, he placed them sloppily onhis head and sat down at the table. ìNow I am ready!î he said.            

ìNot much work to be done tonight, Memory,î said Mr. Stryver happily as helooked at his papers.             

ìHow much?î            

ìOnly two sets of them.î            

ìGive me the worst one first.î            

ìHere they are, Sydney. Fire away!î            

Mr. Stryver lay down on his back on the sofa on one side of the drinkingtable. Mr. Carton sat at his own table, which was covered with papers, on theother side, with the bottles and glasses within reach. Both of them were usingthe drinking table but in different ways. Mr. Stryver was lying back with hishands in his waistband looking at the fire, occasionally looking over somesimple document. Mr. Carton, frowning intently, worked so steadily that hedidnít even look up when he reached for his glass. He often groped around for itfor a minute or two before finding it. Two or three times the business he wasworking on became so difficult that Mr. Carton had to get up and soak his towelsagain. He would return from the water basin wearing the strangest combinationsof wet towels on his head. These looked especially ridiculous because he was soserious about his work.             

After a while Mr. Carton put together a small meal for the lion, Mr. Stryver,to eat. Mr. Stryver took it from him carefully. He picked out what he wanted andcommented on it, and Mr. Carton responded. After they had discussed the meal,Mr. Stryver put his hands in his waistband again and lied down to think. Mr.Carton would then energize himself with a glass of punch and fresh towels, andput together a second meal. He served it to Mr. Stryver in the same manner, andhe didnít finish his work until three in the morning.             

ìAnd now that weíre finished, Sydney, fill a glass of punch,î said Mr.Stryver.             

Mr. Carton took the towels off of his head, which was steaming again. He shookhimself, yawned, shivered, and did what Mr. Stryver said.             

ìYou did well with those witnesses for the prosecution today, Sydney.î            

ìDonít I always do well?î            

ìIím not questioning it. What has put you in such a bad mood? Have some punch.That will improve your mood.î            

With a disapproving grunt, Mr. Carton did what he was told.             

ìYouíre acting just like you did back when we were at Shrewsbury Schoola famous school for boysShrewsbury School,î said Stryver, noddinghis head as he thought about Mr. Carton in the past and present. ìSydney theseesaw! Up one minute and down the next. In a good mood one minute, in a badmood the next.î            

ìAh!î Mr. Carton sighed. ìYes! Iím the same Sydney, with the same bad luck.Even then, I did other boysí homework and rarely did my own.î             

ìAnd why not?î            

ìGod only knows. It was just the way I was, I guess.î            

He sat with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out in front ofhim, looking at the fire.             

ìCarton,î said Mr. Stryver, turning toward him forcefully as if he could bullyhim into becoming ambitious. ìYouíve always been lazy. You have no energy orpurpose. Look at me.î            

ìDonít bother me,î answered Sydney, with a somewhat cheerful laugh. ìDonít    you moralize.î            

ìHow have I done all I have done? How do I do what I do?î            

ìPartly by paying me to help you, I suppose. But donít bother lecturing meabout it. You do what you want to do. You were always on the front lines, and Iwas always in back.î             

ìI had to push my way to the front lines. I wasnít born there, was I?î            

ìI wasnít there at your birth, but I think that you were,î said Carton. Helaughed again, and then they both laughed together.             

ìBefore Shrewsbury, and at Shrewsbury, and ever since Shrewsbury,î continuedCarton, ìyou have always been ahead and I have always been behind. Even when wewere in Paris studying French and French law, and trying to learn other Frenchthings that werenít very good for us, you were always going somewhere and I wasalways going nowhere.î             

ìAnd whose fault was that?î            

ìOn my life, Iím not sure that it wasnít your fault. You were always pushingand shoving and striving ahead. I had no chance but to sit back and waste away.Itís depressing, though, to talk about the past at the beginning of a new day.Change the subject for me before I leave.î            

ìWell then! Letís talk about that pretty witness,î said Stryver, holding hisglass. ìIs that a more pleasant topic?î            

Apparently it wasnít, for he got depressed again.             

ìPretty witness,î muttered Carton, staring into his glass. ìIíve had enough ofwitnesses today and tonight. Which pretty witness are you talking about?î            

ìMiss Manette, the doctorís beautiful daughter.î            

ìShe? Pretty?î said Carton.             

ìIsnít she?î            

ìNo.î            

ìWhy, everyone in the courtroom was admiring her!î            

ìWho cares? Who made the Old Bailey a judge of beauty? She looked like a blonddoll.î            

ìDo you know, Sydney,î said Mr. Stryver, looking at him intently and wipinghis face with his hand. ìYou know, during the trial I thought you sympathizedwith the blond doll, and were interested to see what happened to that blonddoll.î            

ìInterested to see what happened to her? A man can tell if a girl is about tofaint right in front of his face. I agree to that, but I deny that sheísbeautiful. Iím done drinking. Iím going to bed.î            

Mr. Stryver followed Mr. Carton with a candle to show him the way down thestairs. The day looked cold through the grimy windows. When he left the house,it was cold and sad outside. The sky was gray and overcast. The river was dark.The whole scene looked like a lifeless desert. Clouds of dust were blowingaround in the morning wind, as if the desert sand had risen far away and wasabout to cover London.             

Feeling empty, with this desert all around, Mr. Carton stopped as he crossedan empty terrace and stood still. For a moment he imagined a life filled withhonor, ambition, sacrifice, and hard work. It was a life filled with hope andpossibility. The fantasy lasted only a moment, and then it was gone. He climbedto his room high up in a group of houses. He threw himself down on his unmadebed still wearing his clothes, his pillow wet with tears cried for his wastedlife.            

Sadly, sadly, the sun rose. There wasnít a sadder sight that morning than Mr.Carton, a good man with good skills who was unable to put them to good use. Hewas unable to help himself or to make himself happy. He was aware of histroubles but had resigned himself to them.             

Dr. Manetteís quiet apartment was on a quiet street corner near Soho Square.It was a fine Sunday afternoon four months after Mr. Darnayís trial for treason.By now the public had forgotten all about it. Mr. Jarvis Lorry walked along thesunny streets from his home in Clerkenwell to dine with Dr. Manette. Afterfalling back a few times into being consumed by his work, Mr. Lorry had becomefriends with Dr. Manette, and his visits to Dr. Manette made up the happiestpart of his life.            

On this particular fine Sunday, Mr. Lorry walked toward Soho early in theafternoon for three reasons. First of all, on nice Sundays he often went out fora walk with the doctor and Lucie before lunch. Secondly, on Sundays when theweather was bad, he often spent the day with them as a family friend at theirhouse, talking, reading, looking out the window, and generally getting throughthe day. Thirdly, he had his own problems to work out, and the time at thedoctorís house was a good time to work them out.             

There wasnít a nicer street corner in London than the corner where Dr. Manettelived. It was a dead end, and there was a pleasant little view of the streetfrom the front windows of his apartment that provided a sense of being away fromthe commotion. There werenít many buildings north of Oxford Road back then.Trees and wildflowers flourished, and hawthorn grew all over the fields thathave since disappeared. Because of this, country air flowed briskly through Sohoinstead of fading away into the countryside like beggars without a home. Therewere many peach trees nearby, growing up against the south walls of thebuildings.             

The street corner Dr. Manette lived on was well lit by sunlight early in theday, but in the hot part of the day, the corner was in shade, though not in sucha large shadow that you couldnít see past it into the sunlight. It was a coolspot, calm but cheerful. It was a good place to hear echoes and escape the noiseof the busy city streets.            

It was fitting that the doctorís quiet home was on such as a quiet street. Helived in two floors of a large stiff house where several businesses weresupposedly open during the day. But they made almost no noise during thedaytime, and they were completely silent at night. There was a building in backthat was only reachable by a courtyard where a plane tree grew. In the buildingthere was a shop that claimed to make church organs, engrave silver, and makeitems out of gold. The golden arm of a mysterious giant stuck out of the wall ofthe front hall, as if he had beaten himself golden and might threaten to do thesame to any visitors. Noise was rarely heard from these businesses, or from theone lodger who was said to live upstairs, or from the dumb maker ofcoach-trimmings who claimed to have an accounting house downstairs. Once in awhile a stray workman, putting his coat on, would walk across the hall, or astranger would come looking around. Sometimes you would hear a clink in thedistance across the courtyard or the golden giant would make a thump. These werethe only sounds to be heard. Otherwise, the sparrows in the plane tree behindthe house and the echoes in the corner were the only sounds to be heard allweek.             

Here, Dr. Manette met with the few patients he had acquired by his oldreputation and its revival by the rumors about his imprisonment. His knowledgeof science and the clever experiments he conducted also brought him work, and hewas able to earn as much money as he wanted.             

Mr. Jarvis Lorry knew all this about Dr. Manette and had it in mind when herang Dr. Manetteís doorbell on that fine Sunday afternoon.            

ìIs Dr. Manette home?î he asked the handmaid who answered the door.             

The handmaid answered that he was expected home soon.            

ìIs Miss Lucie home?î            

The handmaid answered that she too was expected home soon.            

ìIs Miss Pross home?î            

The handmade answered that she might be at home but that she couldnít say forsure.            

ìSince I feel at home here myself, Iíll go upstairs,î said Mr. Lorry.            

Even though Miss Manette had known nothing about France, she apparently hadinnately developed the ability to make much of very little, which is one of themost useful and pleasant skills of the French people. Even though it was simplyfurnished, the room was decorated with many little ornaments. These ornamentswerenít expensive, but they were tasteful and interesting and had a delightfuleffect on the room. The look of everything in the apartment, from the largest tothe smallest objects, the color scheme, the elegance of the variety, andcontrast of little decorations, were pleasing and expressive of Miss Manetteístaste. So much so that, as Mr. Lorry stood looking around, the furniture seemedto wear the same expression that he had seen so many times on Miss Manetteísforehead. As a result, the tables and chairs themselves seemed to ask him if heliked the way the room had been decorated.            

There were three rooms on each floor, and the doors of each room had been leftopen to air them out. Mr. Lorry, smiling as he thought of that resemblance toLucie Manette that he saw all around him, walked from one room to another. Thefirst room was the nicest. In it were Lucieís pet birds, flowers, books, a desk,a worktable, and a box of watercolor paints. The second room was Dr. Manetteísconsulting room, which they also used as a dining room. The third room was thedoctorís bedroom. Light filtered in through the leaves of the plane tree outsidethe window and speckled the walls and floor in shifting patterns. In the cornerstood the unused shoemakerís bench and a tray of tools. It looked the same as ithad on the fifth floor of that miserable house near the wine shop in the suburbof Saint Antoine in Paris.             

ìItís strange that he keeps that reminder of his suffering near him,î said Mr.Lorry, looking around.            

ìAnd why is that strange?î was the unexpected question that made him jump.        

The question came from Miss Pross. She was the strong, wild, red woman whom hehad first met at the Royal George Hotel in Dover. Mr. Lorry got along with hermuch better now.             

ìI should have thoughtóî Mr. Lorry began.            

ìPooh! Youíd have thought!î said Miss Pross, and Mr. Lorry stoppedtalking.            

ìHow are you?î the lady then asked. She said it harshly, but still trying tobe friendly.            

ìI am pretty well, thank you,î answered Mr. Lorry meekly. ìHow areyou?î            

ìNothing to brag about,î said Miss Pross.            

ìIndeed?î            

ìAh! Indeed!î said Miss Pross. ìI am very unhappy about Miss Manette.î             

ìIndeed?î            

ìFor goodness sake, say something besides ëindeed,í or youíll annoy me todeath,î said Miss Pross. She had a tendency to be short with people, althoughshe was rather a tall woman.             

ìReally, then?î said Mr. Lorry, changing his phrase.            

ìëReallyí is bad, but itís better than ëindeed.í Yes, I am veryunhappy.î            

ìMay I ask why?î            

ìI donít want dozens of people who are unworthy of Miss Manette coming here tolooking for her,î said Miss Pross.            

ìDo dozens of people come here for that?î            

ìHundreds,î said Miss Pross.            

Miss Pross had the habit, like many other people before and after her, toexaggerate her point after someone questioned it.            

ìDear me!î said Mr. Lorry. It was the safest thing he could think tosay.            

ìI have lived with heróor rather, she has lived with meósince she was tenyears old and paid me for it. She certainly shouldnít have if I could haveafforded to take care of her or myself for nothing. Itís been very hard,î saidMiss Pross.            

Mr. Lorry didnít understand what exactly was ìvery hard,î so he shook hishead. He used this gesture of shaking his head as a kind of magical cloak, whichwould fit any occasion the way a magical cloak would fit anyone.            

ìAll sorts of people who are not worthy of her keep showing up,î said MissPross. ìWhen you started itóî            

ìWhen I started it, Miss Pross?î            

ìDidnít you? Who brought her father back to life?î            

ìOh! If thatís what you mean by starting itóî said Mr. Lorry.            

ìIt wasnít ending it, was it? As I was saying, when you started it, it washard enough. Not that I can blame Dr. Manette, except that he doesnít deserve tohave such a daughter. This isnít his fault, for it canít be expected that anyonewould be worthy under the circumstances. But it really is two or three timesharder to have crowds of people showing up after himóI could have forgivenhimóto take Miss Manetteís affections away from me.î            

Mr. Lorry knew that Miss Pross could be a jealous woman, but he also knew bynow that she was, beneath all her odd behavior, unselfish in a way that onlywomen can be. She was the type of woman who would, for love and admiration,commit herself like a slave to a woman. She would commit to a young woman,though she herself was old. Or to a beautiful woman, though she had never beenbeautiful. Or to a successful woman, though she had no accomplishments. Or to ahopeful woman, though sheíd never had hope in her own life. Mr. Lorry knewenough about the world to know that there is nothing better than true love anddevotion that is free from selfish motives. When he thought of the rewards ofthe afterlife (we all sometimes think of such things), he placed Miss Pross muchcloser to the lower angels than some of the most beautiful women, eithernaturally beautiful or who had made themselves beautiful with makeup and fineclothes, who had money at Tellsonís Bank.             

ìThere has only ever been one man worthy of Miss Manette,î said Miss Pross.ìThat was my brother, Solomon, if he hadnít made a mistake in life.î            

Mr. Lorryís questions about Miss Prossís personal life had taught him thatSolomon was a heartless crook who had taken everything she owned and had lost itin bad investments. He had abandoned her and had left her destitute forever, andhad never felt the slightest guilt about it. Mr. Lorry took very seriously MissProssís faith in Solomon and the fact that she only blamed him a little bit forthis huge betrayal. It had an effect on his good opinion of her.            

ìAs we happen to be alone here together and are both businesspeople,î he saidwhen they had gone back into the drawing room and had sat down together, ìlet meask you a question. Does Dr. Manette ever speak to Lucie about his time makingshoes in prison?î            

ìNever.î            

ìAnd yet he keeps his bench and tools near him?î            

ìAh! I didnít say he never thinks of it himself,î answered Miss Pross, shakingher head.             

ìDo you believe he thinks of it often?î            

ìI do,î said Miss Pross.             

ìDo you imagineóî Mr. Lorry started, but Miss Pross cut him off with:            

ìNever imagine anything. Itís better to have no imagination at all.î            

ìI stand corrected. Do you supposeóyou do suppose still, donít you?î            

ìNow and then,î said Miss Pross.            

ìDo you suppose,î continued Mr. Lorry with a twinkle in his eye as he lookedat her kindly, ìthat Dr. Manette has any idea as to why he was imprisoned? Orthat he perhaps even knows who sent him to prison?î            

ìI donít suppose anything but what Miss Manette tells me.î            

ìAnd that isÖ?î            

ìShe thinks that he does.î            

ìNow donít get mad at me for asking all of these questions. I am only a dullbusinessman. You are a businesswoman.î            

ìDull?î asked Miss Pross calmly.            

Wishing he hadnít used that adjective to describe himself, he answered, ìNo,no. Surely not. But to get back to business. Isnít it remarkable that Dr.Manette, since he is definitely innocent of any crime, doesnít talk about thatquestion? Not that he should talk about it with me, although we had a businessrelationship long ago and now we are friends. But with his daughter, whom he isso devoted to and who is devoted to him? Believe me, Miss Pross, I donít bringit up out of mere curiosity, but because I am deeply interested in thematter.î            

ìWell! As well as I understand it, which is not well at all, he is afraid ofthe whole topic,î said Miss Pross.            

ìAfraid?î            

ìI think itís clear enough why he would be. Itís a dreadful thing to remember.Besides that, he lost part of himself in prison. Not knowing how he losthimself, or how he eventually found himself again, he might never feel certainthat he wonít lose himself again. That alone would make it an unpleasantsubject, I would think.î            

It was a more insightful answer than Mr. Lorry had expected. ìTrue,î he said.ìIt would be frightening to remember. Yet I wonder if it is good for Dr. Manetteto keep that shut up inside of him. It causes me uneasiness sometimes, which iswhy I am asking you about it now.î            

ìIt canít be helped,î said Miss Pross, shaking her head. ìIf you bring up thesubject at all, his mood instantly changes for the worse. Itís best to leave italone. In short, we must leave it alone whether you want to or not. Sometimes hegets up in the middle of the night. We can hear him upstairs pacing up and downin his room. Miss Manette knows that in his mind he is pacing up and down in hisold prison cell. She rushes to him and they continue together, pacing up anddown, up and down, until he is calm again. But he never speaks a word to her ofthe real reason for his restlessness, and she thinks its best not to bring itup. They pace up and down together in silence until her love and companionshipbring him back to his senses.î             

Miss Pross claimed not to have an imagination. But there was something in herunderstanding of being haunted by a single sad idea, and in her repetition ofthe phrase ìpacing up and down,î that made Mr. Lorry think that she had animagination after all.            

The street corner, as was mentioned earlier, was a good place for echoes. Mr.Lorry could now hear the echo of footsteps coming toward them as if the mentionof pacing up and down had started it.             

ìTheyíre here!î said Miss Pross, getting up from her chair. ìAnd soon therewill be hundreds of people here to visit Miss Manette!î            

The acoustics were so strange in the street corner that, as Mr. Lorry stoodnear the open window, he could hear the doctorís and Miss Manetteís footstepsbut still couldnít see them. He thought they would never arrive. Not only wouldechoes die out as though the doctor and Miss Manette had walked away, but echoesof other footsteps would be heard instead and would die away for good when itseemed like they were close by. Finally, Dr. Manette and Miss Manette appearedand Miss Pross was waiting for them at the door.             

Though she was wild, red, and grim looking, Miss Pross was a pleasant sight asshe took off Miss Manetteís bonnet, wiped it off with her handkerchief, and blewthe dust off it when Miss Manette came up the stairs. Miss Pross folded her mantlea loose, sleeveless cloakmantle andlaid it out, and she smoothed Miss Manetteís hair with as much pride as if shewere a beautiful, conceited woman admiring her own hair. Miss Manette lookedpleasant, too, hugging Miss Pross and thanking her. She protested that MissPross was taking too much trouble with her, but she only did this playfully, orMiss Pross would have been hurt, and would have gone off to her room alone andcried. The doctor also looked pleasant, watching them and telling Miss Pross howshe spoiled Lucie. You could tell from his eyes, though, that he spoiled her tooand would spoil her more if he could. Mr. Lorry looked pleasant too, looking atthem fondly from under his little wig and thanking his lucky stars that he hadfound such a lovely home in his later years since, as a single man, he had nofamily of his own. Mr. Lorry looked for the hundreds of visitors Miss Pross hadsaid would be coming, but no one arrived.             

By lunchtime still no hundreds of people had arrived. In the management oftheir little household, Miss Pross was always in charge of the lower floors anddid a good job with them. The lunches she made were very modest but were wellcooked and well presented. They were so interesting, being half English and halfFrench, that nothing could have been better. Miss Pross, being a very practicalwoman, would search Soho and other nearby neighborhoods for poor French people,and she would pay them shillings and half crowns to tell her their secretrecipes. She had learned such wonderful cooking skills from these poor Frenchmen and women that the woman and girl servants at the house thought of her as awitch, or Cinderellaís fairy godmother. She could take a chicken, rabbit, orvegetable from the garden and turn it into whatever she wanted to like magic.        

On Sundays, Miss Pross ate at the same table as the doctor, but on other daysshe insisted on eating at unknown times, either downstairs or in her own room onthe second floor. Her room was a blue room that no one was allowed to enterexcept for Lucie. On this occasion, Miss Pross went out of her way to make agood meal to please the beautiful Lucie, so the food was very good.            

It was a hot day, and after lunch Lucie suggested that they take their wineout under the plane tree, where they could sit in the fresh air. As everyonealways did what Lucie wanted, they all went out under the plane tree. Luciecarried the wine down for Mr. Lorry. She had taken on the role of Mr. Lorryíscup bearer, and while they sat under the plane tree talking, she made sure hisglass was always full. They could see the backs of other houses from where theysat talking, and the wind blew gently through the leaves of the plane tree abovetheir heads.             

Hundreds of people still did not arrive. Mr. Darnay came by while they weresitting under the plane tree, but he was the only one.             

Dr. Manette welcomed him kindly, and so did Lucie. Miss Pross, however,suddenly started twitching in her head and body and went into the house. Thisoften happened to her, and she would refer to it among friends as ìa fit ofjerks.î            

The doctor was in the best health and looked especially young. At such timeshe looked very much like Lucie. As they sat there, side-by-side, she leaningagainst his shoulder and he resting his arm on the back of her chair, it wasvery pleasant to see the similarity.             

He had been talking all day about all sorts of things in an unusually livelyway. ìSay, Dr. Manette,î said Mr. Darnay as they sat under the plane tree, ìhaveyou seen much of the Tower of London?î He said it in regards to the topic theywere discussing at the time, which happened to be the old buildings of London.        

ìLucie and I have passed by it, but only casually. We have seen enough of itto know that itís very interesting. Thatís all.î            

ìI have been there, as you know,î said Darnay, smiling, though his face turneda bit red with anger, ìin a different way, and not in a way that allows someoneto see much of it. They told me something interesting when I was there.î            

ìWhat was that?î asked Lucie.             

ìSome workmen stumbled upon an old dungeon while they were making renovations.It had been built over and forgotten for many years. On every stone of the innerwall there were inscriptions of dates, names, complaints, and prayers that hadbeen carved by prisoners. On a stone in a corner, one prisoner, who it seems waseventually executed, had carved three letters. They were carved with a dullinstrument, and they were done in a hurry with an unsteady hand. At first theyread the letters as D.I.C., but when they looked more carefullythe last letter turned out to be a G. There was no record of aprisoner being there with those initials, and no one could guess what the namecould have been. After a long time it was suggested that the letters werenítinitials, but the word dig. They examined the floor carefullyunder the inscription, and in the ground, under a stone or tile in the floor,they found the ashes of a paper mixed with the ashes of a small leather bag.What the prisoner had written on the paper will never be known. But he hadwritten something and had hidden it from the jailer.î             

ìFather! Youíre sick!î cried Lucie.             

Dr. Manette had jumped up suddenly, with his hand to his head. His behaviorand look frightened them.             

ìNo, my dear. Iím not sick. There are large drops of rain falling, and theymade me jump. We had better go inside. ì            

He recovered almost immediately. Rain really was falling in large drops, andhe showed them the rain drops on the back of his hand. But he didnít say a wordabout the discovery Mr. Darnay had mentioned. As they went into the house, Mr.Lorryís analytical eyes saw, or thought they saw, the same look on the doctorísface, as he turned it toward Charles Darnay, as he had when he had turned towardhim in the hallways of the courthouse at the Old Bailey.            

The look vanished so quickly, however, that Mr. Lorry doubted that he had seenanything at all. The doctor was now steadier than the arm of the golden giant inthe hallway. He stopped under it to say that he was still vulnerable to slightsurprises (he might always be), and the rain had surprised him.             

At teatime, while Miss Pross made tea, she had another twitching fit like shehad before, and hundreds of people had still not arrived to visit Miss Manette.Mr. Carton had arrived, but he was only the second person to come by.             

It was such a hot night that, although they had the doors and windows open,they were overpowered by the heat. When they were done with the tea table, theyall moved to one of the windows and looked out into the dusk. Lucie sat by herfather, Darnay sat beside her, and Carton leaned against the window. The windfrom the thunder gusts blew the long, white curtains up near the ceiling likethe ghostly wings.             

ìThe rain is still falling in large, heavy, sparse drops,î said Dr. Manette.ìThe drops come slowly.î            

ìThe storm is on its way,î said Carton.            

They spoke quietly, the way people speak when they are waiting for something,the way people speak in a dark room while waiting to see lightning.            

People were running through the streets trying to get inside before the stormbroke. The street corner was filled with the echoes of footsteps coming andgoing, even though no one could actually be seen walking there.             

ìIt sounds like so many people, and yet no one is there!î said Darnay afterthey had listened for a while.            

ìIsnít it impressive, Mr. Darnay?î asked Lucie. ìSome nights I have sat hereuntil I have imaginedóbut even something silly I have imagined makes me shuddertonight, when everything is so dark and seriousóî            

ìLet us shudder too. Tell us what it is.î            

ìIt will seem like nothing to you. Such ideas are only interesting as we makethem up, I think. They shouldnít be told to others. I have sometimes sat herealone at night, listening until I have imagined that all of the echoes are theechoes of the footsteps of the people that will soon be coming into ourlives.î            

ìA lot of people will be coming into our lives if thatís the case,î addedSydney Carton in his moody way.            

The footsteps never stopped. They sped up more and more, and the corner echoedand re-echoed with their sound. Some seemed to be under the windows, and someseemed to be in the room. Some were coming and some were going. Some of themwere breaking off and some stopped altogether. All were in the streets in thedistance, and no one was in sight.             

ìAre all these people making these footsteps destined to come to all of ushere? Or do we divide them among us?î            

ìI donít know, Mr. Darnay. I told you it was my silly imagination, but youasked to hear it. When Iíve let my mind wander like this, Iíve been alone, andthen Iíve imagined that they were the footsteps of the people who will come intomy life. And my fatherís life.î            

ìIíll accept them into my life!î said Carton. ìI ask no questions and have noconditions. There are a lot of people coming toward us, Miss Manetteóand I cansee them by the lightning.î He added the last words just after a bright flash oflightning, which illuminated him as he lounged in the window.             

ìAnd I hear them!î he added, after a roar of thunder. ìHere they come, fast,fierce, and furious!î            

He was talking about the rush and roar of rain, and he stopped talking becausehe couldnít be heard over the rain. A terrific storm of thunder and lightningbroke, and the thunder, lightning, and rain did not stop even for an instantuntil after the moon rose at midnight.             

The bell at Saint Paulís Cathedral struck one oíclock in the now clear air.Mr. Lorry headed home to Clerkenwell, escorted by Jerry, who wore high boots andcarried a lantern. There were lonely parts of the road on the way between Sohoand Clerkenwell, and Mr. Lorry worried about thieves and always used Jerry for aride home, though he usually headed home two hours earlier.             

ìWhat a night it has been!î said Mr. Lorry. ìAlmost a night that would bringthe dead out of their graves, Jerry.î            

ìIíve never seen a night that would do that. And I donít expect to,î answeredJerry.            

ìGood night, Mr. Carton,î said Mr. Lorry. ìGood night, Mr. Darnay. Do youthink weíll ever see such a night together again?î            

They might. They might also see a great roaring crowd of people come rushingat them, too.             

The monseigneur, one of the great and powerful lords of the court, held areception every two weeks at his grand hotel in Paris. The monseigneur was inhis private room, and the crowd of people in the outer rooms worshipped themonseigneur and treated his private room like a holy sanctuary. The monseigneurwas about to have his chocolate. He could swallow anything easilyóa few unhappypeople were even saying that he was quickly swallowing all of Franceóbut hecouldnít eat his morning chocolate without the help of four strong men, as wellas the cook.             

Yes, it took four men. All of them were dressed extravagantly, and the one incharge had two gold watches in his pocket, following the monseigneurís noble andchaste example. One servant carried the pot of chocolate to the monseigneur, thesecond stirred up the chocolate with a little instrument, a third brought himhis napkin, and a fourthóthe one with two watchesópoured out the chocolate. Themonseigneur couldnít have gotten rid of one of these servants without losing hisadmired place in the world. He would have brought great shame to his familycrest if he had had only three servants. Having only two would have killedhim.            

Monseigneur had been out to dinner the night before, where the Comedy and theGrand Opera had been performed. Monseigneur went out to dinner most nights, andthere were always interesting people around. He was so polite and easily swayedthat the Comedy and the Grand Opera influenced his opinion on matters ofgovernment and state secrets far more than the countryís needs did. This wasnítgood for France, as itís never good for a country to be ruled by frivolousleaders, like when the merry StuartKing Charles IIStuart ruled England.            

The monseigneur had one truly noble idea about public business in general: tolet everything continue on its own. For specific kinds of public business he hadanother respectable idea: that it should benefit him personally and give himmore power or money. He believed that the world had been created to bring himpleasure. The text of his class, which had only been changed by one pronoun,read, ìThe earth and its fullness are mine, says the monseigneur.î            

However, the monseigneur had slowly discovered that things were not going wellin his private and public financial affairs, so he had become close with the taxcollector. The monseigneur relied on the tax collector for public financialmatters because he didnít understand them and had to rely on someone who could.He relied on him for private finance, because tax collectors were rich, andafter many years of living in luxury the monseigneur was running out of money.He had pulled his sister out of a convent before she had become a nun (where shewould have worn a veilóthe cheapest garment she could wear). Instead, he madeher marry a very rich tax collector whose family was of a lower class. This taxcollector, who was appropriately carrying a cane with a golden apple on top, wasone of the people in the other room. Most people groveled before the taxcollector. All except people of a higher class like the monseigneur, and evenhis own wife, who looked down on him with contempt.             

The tax collector was an extravagant man. He had thirty horses in his stables,twenty-four manservants in his house, and six maids served his wife. Though hisin-laws looked down on him, the tax collector was the most honest of the peopleat the monseigneurís hotel that day as he didnít hide the fact that all he didwas steal and take what he could.             

Although the rooms were beautiful to look at and decorated with the lateststyles, the hotel was not doing good business. The hotel was of especially poortaste if you considered the poor citizens in their rags and nightcaps nearby. Infact, the slums and the hotel were the same distance from Notre Dame, and itstowers could be seen from both locations. But no one at the monseigneurísworried about this. There were military officers there who knew nothing aboutthe military, and naval officers who knew nothing about ships. There werepoliticians who had no knowledge of current affairs and church officials wholived sinful lives. All of them were completely unfit for their positions, andall of them were lying and pretending to be something they were not. But all ofthem were of the same class, or nearly the same class, as the monseigneur, andtherefore they were given any public jobs that could benefit them. There weremany of these people. People who werenít immediately connected with themonseigneur or the state, but who were also completely disconnected from realityand any honest, hard work, were also everywhere. Doctors who made great fortunesby supplying imaginary cures for diseases that didnít actually exist smiled attheir patients in the monseigneurís front rooms. Theorists who claimed to havesolved all the countryís problems but didnít actually do anything about themrambled on to anyone who would listen. Heretic philosophers who theorizedmeaninglessly about the world to build themselves up talked with hereticchemists who wanted to change metals into gold. All met at this gathering of themonseigneurís.            

Elegant, well-bred gentlemen, who, then just as now, have been known by theirlack of interest in any interesting subject, were in a fine state of exhaustionat the monseigneurís. The spies in the upper-class world of Paris would have hadtrouble finding one wife in the homes of these men who would admit that she wasa mother. Indeed, except for the act of giving birth, which doesnít give someonethe right to be called a mother, babies were out of fashion. Peasant women tookcare of the babies and brought them up, while sixty-year-old grandmothers actedlike twenty-year-olds.             

Everyone there was completely detached from reality. In the outermost roomthere were six or so people who had, for a few years, some vague feeling thatthings in general were getting worse. To fix this, three of them had becomemembers of a cult of Convulsionistsa religious sect whose members went into convulsions under divine inspirationConvulsionists. They were trying to decide right then if they should foamat the mouth, start screaming, or go catatonic to show the monseigneur signs ofwhat would happen in the future. The other three had joined a different cultthat focused on talk of the ìcenter of truth.î They believed that mankind hadabandoned the ìcenter of truthîówhich was very apparentóbut that it was still inthe ìcircumference.î The way to keep us from leaving the circumference, and topush us back into the center, was by fasting and seeing ghosts. So these peoplespent a lot of time talking with ghosts, claiming it did a lot of good, but noone ever saw a tangible difference.             

The comforting part was that everyone at the monseigneurís hotel was perfectlydressed. If the day of Judgment was a day on which oneís clothing were judged,everyone would have been fine for eternity. People frizzled and powdered andstuck their hair up. Their delicate skin was preserved and covered in makeup.The men wore attractive swords, and everyone smelled good. All of this wouldsurely keep anything going forever. The elegant gentlemen of the best breedingwore little decorations that clinked as they strolled around. These goldenchains rang like precious little bells. That ringing, and the rustle of silk andexpensive cloth, caused a flutter in the air that stirred up the hunger of thepoor in Saint Antoine far away.             

Clothing was the one unfailing charm that kept all things in place. Everyonewas dressed for a fancy ball that would never stop, from the people at thepalace of the Tuileries, to monseigneur and all of the court, to the judgesíchambers and all of society. All, that is, except for the poor. Even theexecutioner was dressed for the ball. He, according to the style, performed hisjob dressed up, wearing makeup and a gold-laced coat, high heels, and white silkstockings. At the gallows and the wheelan execution method in which the prisonerís limbs were brokenwheelóthe axe was rarely usedóthe executioner worefancy clothes. He was known as Mr. Paris by Mr. Orleans and his other fellowexecutioners. And who, at the monseigneurís party in 1780, could possibly doubtthat a system based around a made-up, gold-laced, high-heeled,silk-stocking-wearing hangman wouldnít outlast the stars themselves!            

Monseigneur had taken his chocolate from his four servants and eaten it, andhe opened the doors of his inner chamber and came out. When he did, everyonestarted bowing, scraping, fawning, and generally humiliating themselves beforehim. Everyone did so much bowing and praying for the monseigneur that nothingwas left for Heaven, which might have been one of several reason why themonseigneurís worshippers never went there.             

As the monseigneur walked to the distant outer rooms, reaching the far regionof the Circumference of Truth, he talked and smiled to his worshippers,promising something to one person or waving to another. Then he turned, cameback, and eventually went back into his room with his servants. He wasnít seenagain.            

After the monseigneurís show was over, the flutter of people and the ringingof their precious little bells faded and went downstairs. Soon there was onlyone person left in the crowd. He had his hat under his arm and his snuffbox inhis hand, and he slowly walked past the mirrors on the wall on the way out.        

He stopped at the last door on his way and turned toward the monseigneuríschamber. ìI send you to the devil!î he said.            

With that he shook the snuff off his fingers as if he had shaken dust off hisfeet and walked quietly downstairs.             

He was about sixty years old. He was well dressed and proud looking, and hisface was like an elegant maskópale and almost transparent, with every feature init clearly defined, and only one set expression on it. His nose was slightlypinched at the top of each nostril, although it was well formed otherwise. Theonly change in expression that ever happened in his face occurred in these twolittle dents. They changed color sometimes, and sometimes they would contractand expand in a slight pulsing. When this happened they made his whole beinglook cruel and treacherous. His mouth and his eyes were much too thin and flatand added to his treacherous look. But still, it was a handsome and remarkableface.             

The man went downstairs into the courtyard, got into his carriage, and droveaway. Not many people had talked to him at the party. He had kept a little apartfrom the rest, and the monseigneur hadnít been particularly friendly to him. Asa result, he seemed to enjoy seeing the common people running out of the way ofhis horses, often barely avoiding being run down. His driver drove as if he werecharging at an enemy, and this recklessness didnít change the masterís facialexpression at all. Complaints had sometimes been heardóeven in Paris back then,when no one usually cared about such thingsóthat the upper-class custom ofdriving hard in the narrow streets without sidewalks endangered and maimed thepoor in a barbarous manner. But few people cared enough to think twice about it,and as in every other matter, the poor were left to get out of trouble on theirown.            

With a loud rattle and clatter, the carriage rushed through the streets andaround corners, disregarding the safety of others in a way thatís difficult tounderstand now. Women screamed, and men grabbed each other and pulled childrenout of the way. Finally, as the carriage swooped around a street corner by afountain, one of its wheels gave a sickening little bump. Several people criedout, and the horses reared up and halted.             

If the horses hadnít stopped, the carriage probably would have kept going.Carriages often drove on and left behind whomever they had hurt. And why not?But the frightened driver had gotten down quickly off the top of the coach, andten people held the horsesí bridles.             

ìWhatís wrong?î said the man inside. He calmly looked out of the carriage.        

A tall man wearing a nightcap had picked up a bundle from under the horsesífeet and laid it on the base of the fountain. He was kneeling down in the wetmud, howling and crying like a wild animal.            

ìExcuse me, monsieur the marquis!î said a meek man in ragged clothing. ìIt isa child.î            

ìWhy is he howling like that? Is it his child?î            

ìExcuse me, monsieur the marquis. Itís a shame, but yes, it is.î            

The fountain was a little set off from the street, for the street opened intoa space of about ten or twelve square yards. The tall man suddenly got up fromthe ground and ran toward the carriage. Monsieur the marquis reached for thehandle of his sword.             

ìHeís been killed!î screamed the man, extending both arms over his headdesperately. ìHeís dead!î            

The crowd gathered around and looked at monsieur the marquis. They only lookedat him carefully and eagerly, without any menace or anger. No one said anything.After the first cry they had all stayed completely silent. The voice of the meekman was flat and tame with submission. The marquis looked at them all as if theywere rats that had just come out of their holes.             

The marquis took out his purse.             

ìIím amazed that you people canít take care of yourselves and your children.One or another of you is always getting in the way. Who knows how badly youívehurt my horses? Here! Give him that.î            

He tossed a gold coin on the ground for the driver to pick up, and everyoneleaned forward to watch it as it fell. The tall man cried out again desperately,ìHeís dead!î            

Another man, for whom everyone else made way, arrived quickly and stopped him.On seeing this late comer, the meek man fell onto his shoulder, sobbing andcrying and pointing to the fountain where some women were bent over themotionless bundle. They moved around it gently, completely silent, as were themen.             

ìI know, I know,î said the man who had just arrived. ìBe brave, Gaspard! It isbetter for the poor child to die this way than to live. It has died in aninstant without suffering. Could it have lived one hour as happily?î            

ìYou are a philosopher,î said the marquis, smiling. ìWhat is yourname?î            

ìMy name is Defarge.î            

ìWhat is your job?î            

ìI sell wine, monsieur the marquis.î            

ìPick that up, you philosopher and seller of wine,î said the marquis, throwingdown another gold coin. ìSpend it however you like. Are the horses allright?î            

Without bothering to look at the crowd again, monsieur the marquis leaned backin his chair. As the carriage drove away the marquis had the look of a gentlemanwho has accidentally broken some small trifle and paid for it easily. His easewas disturbed when a coin flew into the carriage and landed on the floor.            

ìStop!î said monsieur the marquis. ìStop the horses! Who threw that?î            

He looked to where Defarge the wine seller had been standing a moment before.But instead he saw the poor father facedown on the pavement, crying there. Theonly person who stood beside him was a large, dark woman who was knitting.        

ìYou dogs!î said the marquis smoothly, his face unchanged except for thecorners of his nose. ìI would happily run any of you over and eliminate you likeyou were insects or vermin. If I knew which one of you rascals threw that coininto the carriage, and if that person was nearby, I would crush him under thewheels.î             

The people were so used to being subservient, and had so much bad experiencethat they knew what a man like the marquis could do to them, legally orotherwise, that no one said or did anything. None of the men even raised an eye.Only the woman who stood there knitting looked up steadily, and looked themarquis in the face. He was too dignified to even notice. His hate-filled eyespassed over her, and over the whole crowd of vermin. He leaned back in his seatagain and yelled to the driver, ìGo on!î            

The carriage drove on, and other carriages came speeding by after it.Ministers, state projectors, tax collectors, doctors, lawyers, churchmen, peoplefrom the Grand Opera and the Comedyóall the people who had been at themonseigneurís dinnerócame whirling by. The poorer people came creeping out oftheir homes to look at the accident. They stayed there for hours. Soldiers andpolicemen came between the people and the accident and formed a barrier thatthey slunk behind and peeped through. The father had picked up his dead childand gone off with it long ago. The women who had cared for the child while itwas lying at the base of the fountain sat there watching the water flowing inthe fountain and the rich people drive by. All this time the one woman who wasknitting stayed there, knitting as steadily as fateIn Greek myth, one of the Fates spun a thread that represented each personís destinyfate. Soon everything was back tonormal: The water ran in the fountain. The swift river ran. The day ran intoevening. The life in the streets ran on quietly as it always does. The poor wentback to sleeping in their cramped little homes. The rich people went to theirfancy dinners, and all things ran their course.             

The landscape was beautiful. The corn had a bright color, though there wasnítvery much of it. Little patches of rye grew where corn should have been. Littlepatches of small peas and beans also grew there, and so did little patches ofmost of the cheap vegetables that can be used as substitutes for wheat. Theplants, like the men and women who grew them, looked like they were growingunwillingly, like they wanted to give up and die.             

Monsieur the marquis rode in his traveling carriage, which was loaded withunnecessary things. The carriage was conducted by four horses and two guards onhorseback, all struggling up a steep hill. The marquisís face was blushing red,but not because he wasnít of good breeding. The redness didnít come from withinbut from an external source beyond his control: the sunset.             

The light from the sunset shone so strongly into the traveling carriage whenit reached the top of the hill that the marquis was covered in a crimson light.ìThe light will die out soon,î said the marquis as he glanced at his hands.        

The sun was so low that it set right at that moment. When they adjusted thebrakes of the wheel, the carriage slid downhill. With the smell of fire, the redglow disappeared in a cloud of dust. The sun went down as the marquis went downthe hill, and there was no glow left when they took the brake off thewheel.            

But the impoverished countryside was still there. A little village sat at thebottom of the hill. There was a church tower, a windmill, a forest for hunting,and a cliff with a castle on it that was used as a prison. All of these weregrowing darker as night came on. The marquis looked around at all these objectslike someone who was returning home.             

The village had one poor street with its one poor brewery, a poor tannery, apoor tavern, a poor stable yard for exchanging horses that delivered the mail, apoor fountain, and all the usual poor parts of a village. There were poor peoplethere too. Everyone who lived in the village was poor, and many of them weresitting in their doorways shredding a few onions and other bits of food forsupper. Many were at the fountain washing off leaves, grass, and anything fromthe ground that was edible. Small signs of their poverty were everywhere. Theywere taxed by the state, by the church, and by the lord. They paid both thelocal tax collector and the general tax collector, according to tradition. Itwas amazing there was any village left at all.             

There werenít many children, and there were no dogs around. The men and womenliving there had two choices in life: they could live lives of the lowestquality down in the little village, or they could be locked up and die in theprison on the cliff.             

The marquisís arrival was announced by a messenger who had come ahead of himand by the sound of the horseman cracking his whip, which wrapped around thehorsesí heads like a snake in the night air. The marquisís traveling carriagepulled up in front of the posting-house gate. It was near the fountain, and thepeasants stopped what they were doing to look at him. He looked back at them,and, although he didnít notice it, the peasants were all slowly and surelywasting away, this wasting being the reason that people in England would thinkof Frenchmen as small and thin for the next hundred years or so.             

The marquis glanced over the faces of the peasants, and they bowed their headsbefore him the same way he had bowed his head in front of the monseigneur. Theonly difference was that these people were bowing because they were suffering,not because they wanted to appease him. Just then a gray old repairer of roadsjoined the crowd.             

ìBring that man over to me!î said the marquis to the messenger.             

The man was brought to him. He had taken off his hat and held it in his hand,and the other men crowded around him to look and listen the way the people hadat the fountain in Paris.             

ìDid I pass you on the road?î            

ìYes, Monseigneur. I had the honor of seeing you on the road.î            

ìI saw you coming up the hill. And at the top of the hill?î            

ìItís true, Monseigneur.î            

ìWhat were you looking at so intently?î            

ìMonseigneur, I was looking at the man.î            

He bent down a little, and with his tattered blue cap he pointed under thecarriage. Everyone around him bent over to look under the carriage.             

ìWhat man, you pig? Why were you looking there?î            

ìExcuse me, Monseigneur, he was hanging onto the chain of the brake.î            

ìWho?î asked the monseigneur.             

ìThe man, Monseigneur.î            

ìCurse these idiots! What was the manís name? You know all the men in thispart of the country. Who was he?î            

ìHave mercy on me, Monseigneur! He was not from this part of the country. Iídnever seen him before in my life.î            

ìHe was hanging onto the chain? Was he trying to suffocate himself?î            

ìThat was what was amazing about it, Monseigneur. If youíll permit me. Hishead was hanging overólike this!î            

He turned himself sideways to the carriage and leaned back. He faced up andhis head was hanging down. Then he got back up, fumbled with his cap, and bowed.        

ìWhat was the man like?î            

ìHe was whiter than a miller, Monseigneur. He was covered in dust and white asa ghost. Tall as a ghost too!î            

The description produced an immense reaction in the crowd, but everyone keptlooking at the marquis. They might have been looking to see if he had any ghostson his conscience.             

ìReally, you did well to see a thief traveling under my carriage and not sayanything,î said the marquis sarcastically, aware that he shouldnít let poorpeople bother him. ìBah! Hold him, Monsieur Gabelle!î            

Monsieur Gabelle was the postmaster and also a tax official. He had eagerlycome out to help with the interrogation. He held the man being examined by hissleeve officially.             

ìBah! Go aside!î said Monsieur Gabelle.             

ìArrest this stranger if he tries to stay in your village tonight. And makesure that his business is honest, Gabelle.î            

ìI am happy to be of service, Monseigneur.î            

ìDid he run away, fellow? Where did that accursed man go?î            

The ìaccursed manî was already under the carriage with six or so of hisfriends, pointing out the chain with his blue cap. Some six or so other peoplequickly pulled him out from under the carriage and brought him to the marquis.He was out of breath.             

ìDid the man run away, you dolt, when we stopped to apply the brake?î            

ìMonseigneur, he jumped over the side of the hill, headfirst, the way a personjumps into a river.î            

ìLook into it, Gabelle.î Then he yelled to the driver, ìLetís go!î            

The six or so people who had been looking at the chain were still near thewheels. The wheels turned so quickly that they were lucky to get out of the wayand to save their skin and bones. They were all very skinny, and there wasnítmuch else left of them, otherwise they might not have been so lucky.             

The carriage burst out of the village and headed toward a rise in the road.The hill was steep, though, and soon the carriage had slowed down to a walkingpace. It swung and lumbered up the hill among the sweet scents of the summernight. The horsemen were surrounded by thousands of tiny gnats, and they lashedthe horses with their whips. The valet walked beside the horses. The couriercould be heard as he trotted ahead into the distance.             

At the steepest part of the hill there was a little graveyard with a cross anda large figure of Jesus Christ on it. It was a rough wooden figure done by someamateur country sculptor. He must have based the figure on a person he knew, orperhaps on himself, for it was terribly small and thin.             

A woman was kneeling at the foot of this figure. She turned her head as thecarriage came near her and quickly got up and went to stand at the carriagedoor.             

ìItís you, Monseigneur! I have a petition for you.î            

He exclaimed impatiently but looked out at her. His expression didnít change.        

ìWhat? What is it? Always petitions!î            

ìMonseigneur, for the love of God! My husband the foresterÖî            

ìWhat about your husband the forester? Itís always the same with you people.He canít afford to pay for something?î            

ìHe has paid all that he has, Monseigneur. He is dead.î            

ìGood! Heís quiet. Can I bring him back to life for you?î            

ìSadly, no, Monseigneur. But he is buried over there under a sad little heapof grass.î            

ìSo?î            

ìMonseigneur, there are so many sad little heaps of grassÖî            

ìAgain, so?î            

She looked like an old woman, but she was in fact young. She wrung hervein-covered, rough hands together with wild energy and placed one of them onthe door of the carriage. She did it tenderly as if placing her hand onsomeoneís chest, as if the carriage could feel her touch.             

ìListen to me, Monseigneur. Listen to my petition! My husband died of hunger.So many people do. So many more people will die from hunger.î            

ìAgain, so? Can I feed them all?î            

ìGod knows that Iím not asking for that, Monseigneur. My petition is that asmall bit of stone or wood with my husbandís name be used to mark his grave.Otherwise his burial place will soon be forgotten. No one will find it after Idie of hunger too. I will be buried under a different sad little heap of grass,Monseigneur. There are so many unmarked graves. People are dying faster andfaster. There is so much hunger, Monseigneur. Monseigneur!î            

The valet moved her away from the door, and the carriage drove away quickly.The horsemen sped up, and she was left far behind. The monseigneur, accompaniedby his entourage, was quickly covering the league or two of distance between himand his country house.             

The summer air was sweet all around him, and the same air surrounded thedusty, ragged, worn-out group of peasants at the fountain close by. The repairerof roads with the blue cap was still telling the story of the man under thecarriage. As the crowd grew tired of the story, they walked away one by one.Lights started to shine in the little windows of the village, and the lights inthe windows went out and more stars appeared. It looked as if the lights in thewindows hadnít been put out but had shot up into the sky.             

By then the marquis was at his large, high-roofed house, which was surroundedby trees. A torch was lit, and his carriage stopped and a large door of hischateau was opened for him.             

ìI am expecting Monsieur Charles. Has he arrived from England yet?î themarquis asked one of his servants.            

ìNot yet, Monseigneur,î the servant replied.             

The marquisís chateau was a massive, solid building. It had a large stonecourtyard in front of it, and two stone staircases on either side led up to astone terrace in front of the main door. The whole thing was made of stone. Ithad heavy stone railings and large stone flowerpots with stone flowers in them.There were menís faces and lionís heads carved out of stone decorating thebuilding everywhere. It was as if a Gorgona woman in Greek mythology with snakes for hair who turned people who looked at her into stoneGorgon  had looked at the chateau when it hadbeen built two hundred years ago and turned it all to stone.             

The marquis got out of his carriage and went up the wide flight of shortsteps, and servants with torches went before him. The light cut through thedarkness, causing an owl to hoot in the roof of a large stable that was offthrough the trees. Otherwise it was so quiet that the torches the servantscarried on the steps and held at the front door sounded as if they were burningin a small stateroom instead of in the open night air. There was no other soundbesides the hooting of the owl and the sound of water in a fountain falling intoits stone basin. It was as if the night were holding its breath, sighing a long,low breath, and then holding its breath again.             

The marquis walked through the front door, which clanged shut behind him. Hewalked across a dark hall decorated with old boar spears, swords, and huntingknives. There were also some riding rods and whips, which many of the peasants,all of whom were now dead, had been beaten with when the lord of the house wasangry.             

The marquis avoided the larger rooms, which were dark and had been locked forthe night. With his torchbearer going in front of him, he went up a staircase toa door in a hallway. The door led him to his own private three-room apartment,consisting of a bedroom and two other rooms. The rooms had high, vaultedceilings and cold, bare floors. There were large dogs on the hearth where theywould burn wood in the fireplace during the winter. The rooms had all theluxuries befitting a marquis at this luxurious time and place in history. Thestyle of one of the last kings, Louis XIV of Franceópart of a line of kings thatthought for sure they would rule foreverówas known for its elegant furniture.But there were also many objects that referred to different periods in thehistory of France.             

In the third room the servants set the dinner table for two. The room wasround and was in one of the houseís four towers, the tops of which looked likecandle extinguishers. It was a small room, high up in the chateau. The windowwas wide open and the wooden shutters were closed. The darkness shone throughthe slats of the shutters and made dark horizontal lines on the stone floor.        

The marquis looked at the table settings. ìIs that for my nephew? The servantssaid he hadnít arrived yet.î            

He had not arrived, but he was expected.             

ìAh! He probably wonít arrive tonight. But leave the table as it is anyway. Iwill be ready for dinner in fifteen minutes.î            

The monseigneur was ready for dinner in fifteen minutes, and he sat down aloneto his extravagant dinner. His chair was on the opposite side from the window,and he was eating his soup. He was about to take a sip from a glass of Bordeauxwine when he suddenly put it down.             

ìWhat is that?î he asked calmly, looking at the horizontal lines of black onthe stone floor.             

ìWhat, Monseigneur? That?î            

ìOutside the blinds. Open the blinds.î            

The servant opened the blinds.             

ìWell?î            

ìItís nothing, Monseigneur. Thereís nothing outside but the trees and thedarkness.î            

The servant who had spoken had opened the blinds wide and had looked out intothe empty night. He stood at the window with the darkness behind him, looking tothe marquis for further instructions.             

ìGood,î said the marquis calmly. ìClose the blinds again.î            

The servant closed the blinds and the marquis went back to eating his supper.He had finished half of it when he stopped eating again with his glass of winein his hands. He had heard the sound of wheels, and the sound grew closer andquickly came up to the front of the house.             

ìFind out who has arrived.î            

It was the monseigneurís nephew. He had been a few leaguesa league is about three milesleagues behind the monseigneurearly in the afternoon. He had been catching up to him quickly, but not quicklyenough to arrive with him at the house. At the posting house he had been toldthat the monseigneur was ahead of him.             

The servants told the nephew that supper was waiting for him and that themonseigneur wanted him to join him. He came to supper shortly after he arrived.In England, the monseigneurís nephew was known as Charles Darnay.             

The monseigneur was polite when he arrived, but they did not shake hands.        

ìYou left Paris yesterday, sir?î he asked the monseigneur as he sat down atthe table.             

ìYes, yesterday. And you?î            

ìI came here directly.î            

ìFrom London?î            

ìYes.î            

ìIt took you a long time to get here,î said the marquis, smiling.            

ìNo. I came directly.î            

ìExcuse me! I didnít mean a long time in your journey. I meant a long timeintending to come here.î            

ìI have been delayed byóî the nephew paused ìóvarious business.î            

ìWithout a doubt,î said the marquis calmly.            

While the servants were there, the two men did not speak. After coffee hadbeen served and they were alone, the nephew looked at his uncle. He looked inhis eyesóhis uncleís face was like a fine maskóand started up a conversation.        

ìAs you guess, I have come back, sir, looking for the object that took me awayin the first place. It put me in great and unexpected danger. But it is a sacredobject, and even if it had led to my death, I hope it would have protected me.î        

ìDonít say ëto death,íî said the uncle. ìItís not necessary to say ëtodeath.íî            

ìI doubt, sir, that if it had carried me to the very brink of death, you wouldhave stopped me there,î answered the nephew.             

The expression on the marquisís face, and the dents in his nose, ominouslysuggested that was true. The uncle made a graceful gesture of protest, but itwas so apparent that he was only being polite that it wasnít very reassuring.        

ìIndeed, sir, as far as I know, you may have arranged to make my alreadysuspicious circumstances look even more suspicious.î            

ìNo, no, no,î said the uncle, pleasantly.             

ìBut whether thatís true or not,î continued the nephew, looking at himsuspiciously, ìI know that you would stop me any way you could, and use anymeans necessary.î             

ìMy friend, I told you that myself,î said the uncle. The two dents in his nosepulsed quietly. ìDo me the favor of remembering that I told you that a long timeago.î            

ìI remember that.î            

ìThank you,î said the marquis, very sweetly.            

The tone of his voice stayed in the air like the tone of a musicalinstrument.            

ìIn effect, sir,î continued the nephew. ìI believe that it is both your badluck and my good luck that I am not in a prison in France right now.î            

ìI donít quite understand,î answered the uncle, sipping his coffee. ìCan youexplain?î            

I believe that if you werenít out of favor with the court, and had not beenfor years, that a letter de cachetofficial documents that could be used to send someone to prisonletter de cachet would have put me in prison indefinitely.î             

ìIt is possible that, for the sake of our familyís honor, I might even decideto inconvenience you to that extent,î said the uncle calmly. ìPlease excuseme!î            

ìI see that, luckily for me, you were received coldly two days ago at themonseigneurís reception, as usual,î said the nephew.             

ìI wouldnít say luckily, my friend,î answered the uncle politely. ìI would notbe so sure of that. Some time alone in a prison cell to think things over mighthave a better influence on your future than you have on it yourself. But it isuseless to talk about this. I am, as you have said, at a disadvantage. Theselittle things we doósending people to prison, helping the power and honor offamiliesóthese slight advantages that might inconvenience you are only to begotten by being insistent. So many people want them, and so few get them! Itdidnít used to be like this, but France has changed for the worse in such ways.Our ancestors, not long ago, held the right of life or death over the peasantsand the poor. Many such dogs have been dragged out of this very room and hanged.In my bedroom next door, one man, as far as we know, was stabbed with a poniarda small daggerponiard forsaying disrespectful things about his daughter. His own daughter! We have lostmany of our privileges. There is a new way of thinking today. And the power ofour position, these days, mightóI wonít say that it definitely would, but itmightócause us real inconvenience. All of this is very bad for us!î            

The marquis inhaled a pinch of snuffpowdered tobacco that is sniffed up the nostrilssnuff and shook his head. He was as elegantly unhappyas he could be with a country where he and his family still lived.             

ìWe have used the power of our familyís position, both in the old days andtoday, to such a degree,î said Darnay unhappily, ì that I think our name is morehated that any name in France.î            

ìLetís hope so,î said the uncle. ìHatred of the upper classes is theinvoluntary respect of the low classes.î            

ìThere isnít a person anywhere in this country who looks at me with respect.They look at me with the fear and submission of slavery.î            

ìThat is a compliment to the magnificence of our family, earned by living amagnificent lifestyle. Hah!î The marquis laughed and inhaled another pinch ofsnuff. He crossed his legs daintily.            

The nephew leaned his elbow on the table and covered his face with his hands.The marquis glared at him sideways with a look of sharpness, familiarity, anddislike. The expression didnít match the attitude of indifference he pretendedto have.            

ìThe only philosophy left is oppression! The dark respect of fear and slavery,my friend, will keep the peasants in line as long as this roof blocks out thesky,î he said, looking up at the ceiling.             

That might not be as long as the marquis thought. If someone had shown him apicture of his chateau a few years later, and a picture of fifty others like it,he might not have been able to tell his house from the other burned, destroyedwrecks. As far as the roof, he might have discovered it blocking out the sky ina new awayóshutting it out from the sight of the people who were shot by thebullets of a hundred thousand muskets.             

ìMeanwhile,î said the marquis, ìI will preserve the honor and faith of ourfamily, if you wonít. But you must be tired. Should we end our meeting for thenight?î            

ìOne more minute.î            

ìWe can continue for another hour if you want.î            

ìSir,î said the nephew, ìwe have done wrong, and we are reaping the benefitsof these wrongdoings.î            

ìWe have done wrong?î the marquis repeated with a questioningsmile, delicately pointing at his nephew and then to himself.            

ìOur family. Our honorable family, whose reputation is so very important toboth of us, but in such different ways. Even during my fatherís generation, ourfamily did many wrongs. We hurt every person who came between us and ourpleasure, whatever it was. Why am I talking about my fatherís time when it isalso your time? You are my fatherís twin brother. You inherited as much as hedid and succeeded as head of this family after he died. How can I separate youfrom him?î            

ìDeath has separated us!î said the marquis.             

ìAnd death has left me tied to a system that is dreadful to me. I amresponsible for it but am also powerless in it. I am trying to following throughon my motherís dying request and the look her in eyes, which begged me to havemercy and to make up for past wrongs. I am also tortured by looking for help andpower and finding none.î             

ìIf you are looking for help from me, nephew, you will never find it,î saidthe marquis. He touched Darnayís chest with his finger. They were now standingby the fireplace.             

Every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face was mean andtight. He stood there, looking quietly at his nephew, with his snuffbox in hishand. He touched his nephewís chest with his finger again, as though his fingerwere the tip of a small sword that he delicately ran through his nephewís chest.He said,            

ìMy friend, I will die preserving the system under which I have lived.î            

When he said it, he inhaled a pinch of snuff and put the snuffbox in hispocket.             

ìBetter to be a rational creature,î he added after ringing a small bell on thetable, ì and accept your natural destiny. But I can see that you are lost,Monsieur Charles.î            

ìOur familyís property and all of this country are lost to me,î said thenephew, sadly. ìI am giving them up.î            

ìAre they both yours to give up? France may be, but is our familyís property?Itís hardly worth mentioning because it is so little, but is it yoursyet?î            

ìI have no plan to claim it yet. If I inherited it from you tomorrowóî            

ìWhich I hope, for my sake, is not likely,î the marquis said.             

ìóOr twenty years from nowóî            

ìYouíre too kind,î said the marquis. ìStill, I prefer the possibility that Imay live that long.î             

ìóI would give it up and go live a different kind of life somewhere else. Itisnít much to give up. It only brings me misery.î            

ìHah!î said the marquis, looking around his finely decorated room.             

ìThe room is nice-looking enough. But to see it for what it really is, underthe sky by daylight, it is a crumbling tower of wastefulness. It is poorlymanaged, and we are in debt. We have built our fortune on the oppression,starvation, and mistreatment of others.î             

ìHah!î said the marquis again, in a well-satisfied manner.             

ìIf I ever inherit it, it will be given to someone who is more qualified toput it back into good condition. This way, the poor peasants who are tied tothis land and who have been abused for so long may, in another generation,suffer less. But I donít want it. There is a curse on this house and all of thisland.î            

ìWhat about you?î asked the uncle. ìForgive my curiosity, but with your newideas, how do you plan on making a living?î            

ìI will do what other people here in France do, and what the nobility maysomeday have to do. I will work.î            

ìIn England, perhaps?î            

ìYes. I will not tarnish the family name there. The family name canít harm meelsewhere, since I do not use it in other countries.î            

When the marquis had rung the bell, his valet lit the bedroom next door.Bright light now shone from it through the doorway. The marquis looked that wayand listened until he had heard his valet walk away.             

ìYou like England a lot. You have done well for yourself there,î he said,smiling calmly at his nephew.             

ìI have told you already that I may be indebted to you, sir, for my successthere. Otherwise, it has been a safe haven for me.î             

ìThose bragging English say that it is a safe haven for many people. Do youknow another Frenchman who has also found safety there? A doctor?î             

ìYes.î            

ìWith a daughter?î            

ìYes.î            

ìYes,î said the marquis. ìYou are tired. Good night!î            

As the marquis smiled and bowed, there was something suspicious in his face,and there was something mysterious about his last words. The nephew noticedthis, and it bothered him. At the same time, the thin lines around the marquisíseyes, lips, and nose made his expression look handsome and evil.             

ìYes,î repeated the marquis. ìA doctor with a daughter. Yes. So begins the newway of thinking. You are tired. Good night!î            

It would have been as useful to question the stone faces outside the chateauas it was to question the marquisís face. The nephew looked at him as he passedhim on his way out the door, but he couldnít tell what he was thinking.             

ìGood night!î said the uncle. ìI look forward to seeing you again in themorning. Sleep well!î He called to the servants: ìBring a torch and show mynephew to his room!î Then he muttered to himself, ìAnd burn him to death in hisbed, if you will.î He rang the little bell again and called his valet to his ownbedroom.             

After the valet had come and gone, the marquis paced back and forth in hisloose robe to prepare himself for sleep on that hot, still night. He was wearingsoft slippers on his feet and he moved around the room like an elegant tiger,making no noise at all. He looked like some magical marquis in a story who couldchange into a tiger, and was either just about to become a tiger or change backfrom a tiger into a man.            

He walked from one end of his elegant bedroom to the other, thinking aboutwhat had happened to him that day. He thought of the carriage slowly climbing upthe hill at sunset. He thought of the sun setting and the carriage travelingdown the hill, of the mill, the prison on the rock, the little village in thevalley, the peasants at the fountain, and the repairer of roads with his bluehat pointing out the chain under the carriage. The fountain reminded him of thefountain in Paris, and he though of the bundled-up child lying on the step, thewomen bending over it, and the tall man waving his arms in the air and yelling,ìDead!î            

ìI am cooler now and am ready to go to bed, ì said the marquis.            

He left only one candle burning on the hearth, and he pulled the thin gauzecurtains around the bed. He heard the sound of the wind outside in the night ashe settled down to sleep.             

The stone faces on the chateauís outer walls looked out at the night. It wasquiet and dark for three long hours. For three long hours, the horses rattled intheir stables, the dogs barked, and the owl made a noise that sounded verydifferent from the sound poets say they make. But animals are often stubborn anddonít often say the lines written for them.             

For three hours, the stone faces of men and lions on the chateau stared out atthe night. All of the land was dark, and the dust settled on the quiet roads. Itwas so dark that the little heaps of poor grass in the graveyard wereindistinguishable from one another, and the figure on the crucifix might havecome down, since it was practically invisible in the darkness. In the village,the tax collectors and the people who paid the taxes were fast asleep. They mayhave been dreaming of large feasts, as starving people usually do, or of restingand living easily, as overworked slaves and oxen do. The thin villagers sleptsoundly and, in their dreams, were fed well and were free.             

The fountain in the village flowed silently and invisibly in the darkness, asdid the fountain at the chateau. They melted away like minutes of time duringthe three hours of darkness. Then, it started to turn to daylight.             

It got lighter and lighter until sunlight hit the tops of the trees and lightspread over the hill. In the sunlight, the water in the chateau fountain lookedred as if the water were blood, and the faces of the stone statues were alsored. The birds sang loudly, and one little bird sitting on the windowsill of themarquisís bedroom sang with all its might. The closest stone face nearest seemedto stare at the bird. Its mouth was open wide, making it appear amazed and awestricken.             

Finally the sun was up and people began to stir in the village. Windows wereopened, doors were unlocked, and people came outside shivering, chilled by thesweet morning air. Then they began the hard work that would continue for all ofthem throughout the day. Some went to the fountain, and some went to work in thefields. Men and women went to dig and search for food. They went to tend to themeager livestock and to lead the skinny cows to any meager pastures they couldfind near the roadside. A couple of people were at the church kneeling andpraying at the cross. A cow they had led there tried to eat the weeds at itsfeet.            

The people at the marquisís chateau woke up later than the villagers, as wastheir habit, but they did gradually awake. First, the boar spears and huntingknives hanging in the hallway gleamed red in the sunlight. Then doors andwindows were opened. The horses in their stables turned around to see light andfresh air coming in through the doorways. The iron-grated windows were opened,revealing the leaves outside rustling and sparkling. Dogs pulled at their chainsimpatiently, impatient to be let loose.             

All of these small events were part of the morning routine. But some otherthings were happening that morning were not that common. At the chateau, thelarge bell was ringing. People were running up and down the stairs and hurryingaround on the terrace. People ran everywhere. Others saddled horses quickly androde away.             

What winds told the repairer of roads about this frenzy? He was alreadyworking on the hilltop past the village, with his small lunch lying in a smallbundle on a pile of stones. Had the birds, carrying some grains while they flew,dropped the news to him the way they sowed seeds in the ground? No matter how heknew, that morning the repairer of roads ran as if his life depended on it. Heran down the hill with dust covering his legs to his knees, and didnít stopuntil he got to the fountain.             

Everyone from the village was at the fountain. They stood around in theirdepressed way and whispered quietly, showing no other emotions than morbidcuriosity and surprise. The cows that were being led had been brought in andtied to anything that could hold them. They stood there looking on stupidly, orlying down and chewing cud that they had picked up while walking. Some of thepeople of the chateau, and some from the posting house, and all the taxcollectors, carried weapons. They were gathered on the other side of the streetnot knowing what to do. The repairer of roads had already pushed into a group offifty friends and was hitting himself on the chest with his blue cap. What didall this mean? What did it mean that they had lifted Monsieur Gabelle behind aservant on horseback and were carrying him away on the galloping horse, like anew version of the German ballad of Leonora?            

It meant that there was one stone face too many up at the chateau. Someone wasdead.             

The Gorgon had looked at the building again that night and had turned one moreface to stone. The building had been waiting for this particular stone face fortwo hundred years.             

The stone face was that of the marquis on his pillow. It looked like anelegant mask that had been suddenly frightened, made angry, and had then frozenthat way. A knife had been plunged into his heart. There was a piece of papertied to the handle. On it was written:            

ìDrive him quickly to his tomb. From Jacques.î            

A year had gone by, and Mr. Charles Darnay was settled in England. He taughtthe French language and also had knowledge of French literature. Today he wouldhave been a professor, but back then he was a tutor. He taught young men who hadthe free time and interest to study another language that was spoken all overthe world, and he developed a taste for its knowledge and stories. He could alsotranslate them well into English and read them out loud in English. People withsuch skills were hard to find at that time. Men who were once princes, andsupposed to have become kings, hadnít been forced to work as teachers yet. Noruined nobility had gone broke, lost their accounts at Tellsonís Bank, andbecome cooks and carpenters yet. Mr. Darnay soon developed a good reputation asa tutor who made his studentís time particularly pleasant and beneficial, and asa graceful translator who brought something to his translations besides what youcould find in a dictionary. He knew the situation in France well, and people inEngland were becoming more and more interested in it. By working tirelessly, hewas able to make a good living.             

He hadnít expected things to be easy for him in London. If he had, he wouldníthave done so well. He had expected hard work, and he found it. He did the workand made the best of it, and by doing this, his success continued.             

He spent a certain amount of time at Cambridge, where he taughtundergraduates. The school tolerated him as he secretly taught Europeanlanguages, instead of the official Greek and Latin. He spent the rest of histime in London.             

Now, from the beginning of time in the garden of Eden to the current, harshertimes, a manís life has always gone in the same direction. Charles Darnayís lifetook the same path: he fell in love with a woman.            

He had been in love with Lucie Manette since he had been on trial for hislife. He had never heard a sound so sweet and king as the sound of her voice. Hehad never seen anyone more beautiful than she had been when they met, when hewas about to be executed. But he hadnít told her that he loved her yet. Themurder at the empty chateau, over the water and the long, dusty roads far away,had happened a year ago, and now felt like it was part of a dream. Yet he stillhadnít mentioned as much as a single word to her about his feelings.             

He knew well that he had good reasons for keeping quiet. It was a summer daywhen he arrived in London late after teaching at the college. He turned thecorner of the quiet street in Soho where Lucie and Dr. Manette lived. He was seton telling Dr. Manette how he felt about Lucie. It was the end of a summer day,and he knew that Lucie was out with Miss Pross.             

He found the doctor reading in an armchair near the window. The energy thathad supported him when he was a prisoner had gradually come back to him, and hewas now a very energetic manóvery driven and decisive. His energy sometimes cameand went quickly, as had happened when he first recovered his other faculties,but this didnít happen too often and was happening less and lessfrequently.            

He studied a lot, slept little, handled fatigue easily, and was usuallycheerful. Charles Darnay now entered the room and went toward him. The doctorput his book down and held out his hand.             

ìCharles Darnay! Iím happy to see you! We have been expecting you for three orfour days. Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton were both here yesterday and both saidyou should have visited by now.î            

ìI am thankful to them for their interest in me,î he answered, a littleindifferent about them but very kind to the doctor. ìMiss Manetteóî            

ìIs doing well,î the doctor continued. ìAnd your return will make us allhappy. She is out on some household errands, but she will be home soon.î            

ìDr. Manette, I knew she wasnít at home. I took the opportunity of her beingout to come speak to you.î            

Dr. Manette was silent.             

ìYes?î said the doctor, controlling himself. ìBring your chair over here andtell me what it is.î            

Mr. Darnay brought over the chair as he had been told, but he had troublesaying what he wanted to say.            

ìI have been lucky, Dr. Manette, to spend the last year and a half enjoyingthe comfort of your home,î he began after a long while. ìI hope what Iím aboutto say wonítóî            

The doctor reached out his hand to stop him. After he had kept it there alittle while, he drew back his hand and asked:            

ìIs Lucie what you want to talk about?î            

ìShe is.î            

ìIt is hard for me to talk about her at any time. It is especially hard for meto hear you talk about her in that tone, Charles Darnay.î            

ìIt is a tone of great admiration, true respect, and deep love, Dr. Manette!îhe said respectfully.            

The doctor was silent again. Then he replied:            

ìI believe you. I trust you. I believe you.î            

He was so restrained and so unwilling to talk about the subject that CharlesDarnay hesitated.             

ìShall I continue, sir?î            

The doctor was silent again.             

ìYes. Continue.î            

ìYou know what Iím about to say. But you canít know how serious I am when Isay it, and how much I feel it, without knowing my true thoughts and feelingsand my deepest hopes and fears. Dr. Manette, I am in love with your daughter. Iam devoted to her and think only of her well-being. If there was ever love inthe world, I love her. You have been in love yourself. Think of the love youonce had in your life when you think of me!î            

The doctor sat facing away from him, with his eyes on the ground. After Mr.Darnay had said these last words, Dr. Manette stretched out his hand againquickly and said:            

ìDonít speak of that, sir! Leave that alone! I beg you, donít bring thatup!î            

It sounded so much like he was actually crying out in pain that CharlesDarnayís ears rang long after he had stopped. He gestured with the hand he hadreached out toward him. He seemed to be asking Darnay to pause. Mr. Darnaystopped speaking.             

ìIím sorry,î said the doctor quietly after a while. ìI donít doubt that youlove Lucie. You should be happy about that.î            

He turned toward him in his chair but continued to look at the ground. Herested his chin on his hand, and his white hair hung down over his face.             

ìHave you spoken to Lucie about this?î            

ìNo.î            

ìOr written to her about it?î            

ìNever.î            

ìIt would be rude to pretend not to know that you have kept yourself away fromher out of respect for me. I thank you.î            

He extended his hand but kept looking at the ground.             

ìI know,î said Darnay, respectfully. ìHow could I not know that there is anunusual love between you and your daughter, Dr. Manette? I have seen the two ofyou together day after day. It is so touching, and I know it comes from theextreme circumstances that you have been through together. There can be fewrelationships between a father and a child like it. I know, Dr. Manetteóhowcould I not knowóthat combined with the love of a grown woman for her father,there is, in her heart, the love of an infant for her father as well. I knowthat since she had no parents when she was a child, she is now devoted to youwith all the love of a grown woman, combined with the trust and attachment shenever had as a child. I know well that if you had come back from the dead, youcould hardly seem more sacred to her than you do now. I know that when she isholding onto you, the hands of a baby, a girl, and a grown woman together areembracing you. I know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother as ayoung woman. She sees and loves you as a young man. She loves her brokenheartedmother and loves you through your trial and imprisonment through to when youwere freed and rehabilitated. I have known this, night and day, since I startedto come to visit you here at your home.î            

Her father sat in silence, facing the ground. His breathing had sped up alittle, but otherwise he repressed any signs of being upset.             

ìMy dear Dr. Manette, having always known this, and always seeing the two ofyou together, I have restrained myself as long as humanly possible. I have felt,and even feel now, that to bring my love between you is to taint your past withsomething not quite as good as itself. But I love her. Heaven is my witness thatI love her!î            

ìI believe you,î her father answered sadly. ìI have thought so before now. Ibelieve you.î            

The sadness in Dr. Manetteís voice struck Darnay as a reproach. ìBut do notbelieve that if I were ever lucky enough to make her my wife, that I would evercome between you. If that were so, I would never have told you what I am sayingnow,î said Darnay. ìBesides the fact that I know it would be impossible, I knowthat it would be an awful thing to do. If I had any such plan, even for manyyears from now, or could ever consider such a thing, I wouldnít be able to shakeyour hand right now.î            

He placed his hand on the doctorís hand as he spoke.             

ìNo, dear Dr. Manette. Like you, I left France by choice. Like you, I left toget away from the distractions, oppressions, and unhappiness. Like you, I workedto get away and live by my own hard work. I left in search of a better future,and I only want to share in your happiness, to share your life and home, anddevote myself to you until death. I donít want to take Lucie away from you asyour child and friend, but to tie her closer to you, if such a thing ispossible.î             

He was still holding her fatherís hand. Her father responded by placing hishands on the arms of his chair. He looked up at him for the first time sincetheir conversation had started, and it was obvious that he was struggling withsomething. He struggled with that dark look that would on occasion appear on hisface.             

ìYou speak so passionately, Charles Darnay, that I thank you with all myheart. I will open my heart to you, or nearly so. Do you have any reason tobelieve that Lucie loves you?î            

ìNone. So far, none.î            

ìAre you hoping to find this out from this conversation?î            

ìNot at all. I might not have the courage to do it for weeks. I might have thecourage to do it tomorrow, whether itís the right time to do it or not.î             

ìAre you looking for advice from me?î            

ìIím not asking for any, sir, but I have thought that you might have some tooffer, if you thought it was right to do so.î            

ìAre you hoping for a promise from me?î            

ìYes, I am.î            

ìWhat is it?î            

ìI know that without you I have no hope. I understand that, even if MissManette loved me alreadyódonít assume that I am conceited enough to think thatshe doesóI could ever be loved by her if you didnít approve.î            

ìIf that is so, do you see what else is involved in it?î            

ìI also understand that if her father spoke in favor of any of her suitorsthat it would persuade her more than her own opinion or anything else in theworld. For this reason, Dr. Manetteî said Darnay, ìI wouldnít ask you to do thatif my life depended on it.î            

ìIím sure of it. Charles Darnay, people who are close to each other still havesecrets, just as people who are far apart. In the first case, those secrets aresubtle, delicate, and hard to penetrate. In this way, Lucie is a mystery to me.I donít know how she feels about you.î            

ìMay I ask you, sir, if you think she isóî as he hesitated, the doctorfinished the thought for him.            

ìIs being courted by another man?î            

ìThat is what I meant.î            

Her father thought awhile before he answered:            

ìYou have seen Mr. Carton here. Mr. Stryver is here too, sometimes. If she isbeing courted, it would have to be by one of these two men.î            

ìOr both of them,î said Darnay.            

ìI hadnít thought of that. I think itís more likely that itís neither of them.You want me to promise you something. Tell me what.î            

ìPromise me that if Miss Manette ever tells you that she feels the same wayabout me as I do about her, you will tell her what I have said and that youbelieve me to be telling the truth. I hope you will think well enough of me asto not speak against me. I ask nothing more than that. Just tell me theconditions that you have, which you have a right to have.î            

ìI make the promise without any condition,î said the doctor. ìI believe thatwhat you said is true. I believe your intention is to make the bond between mydaughter and me stronger, not weaker. If she ever tells me that she loves you, Iwill give her to you. If there wereóCharles Darnay, if there wereóî            

Mr. Darnay had taken his hand gratefully. They were holding hands when thedoctor said:            

ìóany ideas, reasons, fears, anything at all, new or old against the man thatshe was in love withóany wrongdoing that he was not directly responsible foróIwould forget them all for the sake of her happiness. She is everything to me.More to me than suffering, more to me than injusticeÖWell! This is pointlesstalk.î            

The way he had stopped speaking, and the way he was looking at him, was sostrange that Darnayís hand turned cold under the doctorís touch. The doctorslowly let go of him.             

ìYou said something to me,î said Dr. Manette, smiling. ìWhat was it you saidto me?î            

He didnít know how to answer. Then he remembered that the doctor had spokenabout there being a condition to his promise. Darnay was relieved to think ofit, and answered:            

ìYour confidence in me should be returned with confidence in you. You mayremember that the name I go by now, although it is only slightly changed from mymotherís, is not my own. I want to tell you what my name really is and why I amin England.î             

ìStop!î said the doctor from Beauvais.             

ìI want to tell you. So that you will trust me and I will have no secrets fromyou.            

ìStop!î            

For a moment the doctor had covered his own ears with his hands, and a secondlater he had covered Darnayís mouth with them.             

ìTell me when I ask you, not now. If you are successful and Lucie loves you,tell me the morning you get married. Do you promise?î            

ìOf course.î            

ìGive me your hand. She will be home soon. Itís better that she doesnít see ustogether tonight. Go! God bless you!î            

It was dark when Charles Darnay left, and it was darker an hour later whenLucie came home. She hurried into the room alone since Miss Pross had gonestraight upstairs and was surprised to find the reading chair empty.             

ìFather?î she called to him. ìFather dear?î            

There was no answer, but she heard a faint hammering sound in his bedroom. Shetiptoed into the next room and looked into his door and came running back,frightened and crying. ìWhat should I do? What should I do?î            

Her indecision only lasted a moment. She hurried back and knocked on his door,and she called out to him softly. The hammering stopped when she spoke, and hecame out to her. They paced up and down together for a long time.             

She got out of bed and went to watch him sleep that night. He slept heavily,and his tray of shoemaking tools and his unfinished shoes were all laid out theway they always were.             

ìMix another bowl of punch, Sydney,î said Mr. Stryver to Mr. Carton that samenight, or early in the morning. ìI have something to say to you.î            

Sydney Carton had been working twice as hard that night, and the night before.He had been working hard for many nights in a row, clearing out a lot of Mr.Stryverís papers before going on a long vacation. The papers had finally beencleared out, and Mr. Stryverís debts had been paid up. Everything was finisheduntil November, when the weather would turn foggy, and legal matters wouldbecome complex and foggy too, and there would be work for him again.             

Sydney wasnít very lively or very sober after working so hard. He had neededextra wet towels on his head to get him through the night. He had needed anextra amount of wine to drink before the towels. He was in bad shape. He pulledthe towels off his head and threw them into the basin where he had been dippingthem now and again for the last six hours.             

ìAre you mixing that other bowl of punch?î asked Stryver. He had his hands inhis waistband, and he looked over from the sofa where he was lying on his back.        

ìI am.î            

ìNow look here! Iím going to tell you something that will surprise you. Itmight make you think that Iím not as smart as you think I am. I plan on gettingmarried.î            

ìDo you?î            

ìYes. And Iím not even marrying for money. What do you say to that?î            

ìI donít have much to say. Who is she?î            

ìGuess.î            

ìDo I know her?î            

ìGuess.î            

ìItís five oíclock in the morning! Iím not going to guess. Iím too tired. Ifyou want me to guess youíll have to ask me at lunch.î            

ìIn that case Iíll tell you,î said Stryver. He sat up slowly. ìSydney, I havetrouble explaining myself to you because youíre an insensitive idiot.î            

ìAnd you,î returned Sydney sarcastically, who was busy mixing the punch, ìaresuch a sensitive and poetic spiritóî            

ìCome on!î Stryver replied, laughing arrogantly. ìI donít claim to be aromantic. I hope I know better than to be that. But I am more sensitive than youare.î            

ìYouíre luckier, you mean.î            

ìThatís not what I mean. I mean I am a man of moreómoreóî            

ìSay ëchivalryí while youíre at it,î suggested Carton.            

ìGood! Iíll say chivalry. What I mean is that I am a man who cares more aboutbeing attractive to women than you do. I work harder at it and Iím better atit,î said Stryver. He puffed up his chest as Carton mixed the punch.             

ìGo on,î said Sydney Carton.            

ìNo. But before I go on,î said Stryver, shaking his head in his bullying way,ìIíll prove my point. Youíve been to Dr. Manetteís house as often as I have,perhaps even more. Iíve been embarrassed by how depressed you act there! Youbehave in a such silent and sullen and downcast way that I am embarrassed byyou, Sydney!î            

ìIt is good for a lawyer to be ashamed about something,î answered Sydney. ìYoushould thank me.î            

ìYou wonít get off that easy,î answered Stryver, shoving the response at him.ìNo, Sydney, itís my duty to tell you. Iím telling you to your face to help you.You arenít suited for that kind of company. You are an unpleasant man.î            

Sydney drank a large glass of the punch he had made and laughed.             

ìLook at me!î said Stryver, turning toward him. ìI donít need put in anyeffort to make myself attractive like you do. I am more independent than youare. I make a lot of money and have a good position. So why do I do it?î            

ìIíve never seen you do it yet,î Carton muttered to himself.             

ìI do it because itís smart to do it. I do it on principle. And look at me! Ido well for myself.î            

ìYou arenít doing well with your story about your plans to marry,î answeredCarton casually. ìI wish you would stay on the subject. And back to meódonít youunderstand that I am hopeless?î            

He looked angry when he asked the question.            

ìYou have no business being hopeless,î answered Stryver harshly.            

ìI have no business being anything as far as I know,î said Sydney Carton. ìWhois the lady?î            

ìNow donít get uncomfortable when I tell you who it is, Sydney,î said Mr.Stryver in a falsely friendly way. ìI know you donít mean half of the things yousay. And even if you meant all of it, it wouldnít matter to me. Iím saying thisbecause you mentioned the young lady to me in a negative way.î            

ìI did?î            

ìYou did. Right here in this apartment.î            

Sydney Carton looked at his punch, and he looked at his satisfied friend. Hedrank his punch and looked at his friend again.             

ìYou called her a golden-haired doll. The young lady is Miss Manette. If youwere someone who had any sensitivity or compassion in that way, Sydney, I mighthave been unhappy about what you said. But you arenít. You have no sense at all.Therefore I am no more upset by what you said than I would be if a man who knowsnothing about art criticized one of my paintings. Or if a man who knows nothingabout music criticized a piece I had written.î             

Sydney Carton drank his punch quickly. He drank it by the glassful. He keptlooking at Stryver.             

ìNow you know all about it, Syd,î said Mr. Stryver. ìI donít care about money.She is a charming woman, and I have decided to make myself happy. Overall Ithink I can afford to be happy. I will be a husband who is already somewhatwealthy, and I am doing better and better for myself. I have some respect. It islucky for her, but she deserves good luck. Are you surprised?î            

Carton, still drinking his punch, answered ìWhy should I be surprised?î            

ìDo you approve?î            

Carton was still drinking his punch. ìWhy shouldnít I approve?î            

ìWell!î said Cartonís friend Stryver, ìyouíre taking it better than I thoughtyou would. And you arenít as protective of me as I would have thought. Thoughyou know pretty well that your old friend is pretty strong willed. Yes, Sydney,I am tired of continuing this lifestyle. I think itís nice for a man to have ahome to go back to when he wants to (when he doesnít, he can always stay away).I feel that Miss Manette will be presentable in any company and will make melook good. So I have decided to marry her. And now, Sydney, old friend, I wantto say something to you about your hopes. You are doing poorly for yourself, Iknow. You really are. You donít understand the value of money. You drink a lot.There will come a time when you are sick and poor. You should really think aboutgetting a nurse.î            

Mr. Stryver spoke to him like a successful father speaking to his son. Helooked twice the size he really was, and four times more unpleasant.             

ìNow, let me suggest,î continued Stryver, ìthat you face the reality of yourfuture. I have faced it in a different way. You should face it in your own way.Get married. Find someone to take care of you. Forget that you donít enjoyspending time with women, or understand them, or want to get married. Findsomeone. Find a respectable woman who has a little property. Find some landladyor hotelkeeper and marry her, in case your health goes. Thatís what you need todo. Think about it, Sydney.î            

ìIíll think about it,î said Sydney.            

Mr. Stryver, having made up his mind to be nice enough to marry Lucie Manette,decided to give her the good news before he left town on his long vacation.After thinking it over for a while he decided that it would be best to ask herright away and get it over with. Then they could take their time decidingwhether they should get married a week or two before Michaelmas termsometime in late OctoberMichaelmas term or duringthe Christmas vacation between Michaelmas and Hilary termbetween November 25 and January 11Hilary term.            

He had no doubt that she would want to marry him and was sure she would sayyes. He thought of it as a court case. If he argued his case in practicaltermsóthe only terms worth consideringóit was a clear case without anyweaknesses. He called himself as a witness for the plaintiff. His evidence wasunbeatable. The counsel for the defendant gave up his case, and the jury didníteven need to stop to discuss their verdict. After trying the case, Mr. Stryver,Chief Justice, knew that it was an open-and-shut case.            

Accordingly, Mr. Stryver decided to begin his long vacation with a formaloffer to take Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens. If that didnít work, he wouldtake her to Ranelagh. If that failed too, he would go to her house in Soho andtell her how he felt about her there.             

Mr. Stryver shoved his way through the streets from Temple Bar toward Soho atthe beginning of his long vacation. As he headed toward Soho, while he was stillon Saint Dunstanís side of Temple Bar, he rushed in his all-out way along thesidewalk, shoving aside all weaker people. Anybody who had seen him would havenoticed how invulnerable and strong he was.             

His path took him past Tellsonís Bank, and since he did his banking atTellsonís and knew that Mr. Lorry was a close friend of the Manettes, he decidedto go in and tell Mr. Lorry about his plans to propose to Miss Manette. Hepushed open the creaky door and stumbled down the two steps leading into thebank and walked past the two old cashiers. He shoved his way into the small,dirty back office where Mr. Lorry sat. In front of him were large books withlined columns of numbers in them. There were horizontal iron bars on his window,as if the window had been ruled for crunching numbers too, and everything underthe clouds were a math problem.             

ìHello!î said Mr. Stryver. ìHow do you do? I hope you are well!î            

Mr. Stryverís oddest characteristic was that he always appeared too big forwhatever space he was in. He seemed so large in Tellsonís that old clerks in farcorners looked up in protest as though he were squeezing them against the wall.The head of the bank, reading a paper far away, lowered it unhappily, as if Mr.Stryver had head-butted him in the stomach.             

Mr. Lorry said in a quiet, professional tone, ìHow do you do, Mr. Stryver? Howdo you do, sir?î He shook Mr. Stryverís hand. There was a strangeness in the wayMr. Lorry shook hands. All the clerks at Tellsonís shook hands this way when thehead of the bank was there. He shook hands in an impersonal way, as if he wereshaking hands on behalf of the whole company.             

ìCan I do anything for you, Mr. Stryver? asked Mr. Lorry in a professionalway.             

ìWhy, no, thank you. This is a personal visit, Mr. Lorry. I have come to havea word with you in private.î             

ìOh, really?î said Mr. Lorry. He leaned down so that he could hear him butkept looking at the head of the bank far away.             

ìI am going,î said Mr. Stryver, leaning on the desk. When he did, although thedesk was very large, it looked as though there werenít even half enough desk forhim. ìI am going to ask your friend, Miss Manette, to marry me, Mr.Lorry.î            

ìOh dear me!î yelled Mr. Lorry, rubbing his chin and looking at Mr. Stryverdoubtfully.             

ìëOh, dear me,í sir?î repeated Stryver, pulling away. ìOh, dear you, sir? Whatdo you mean, Mr. Lorry?î            

ìI mean it in a friendly way,î answered Mr. Lorry professionally. ìIt speakswell for you, and, in short, I wish you everything you desire. But really, youknow, Mr. Stryveróî Mr. Lorry paused. He shook his head at him strangely, as ifhe couldnít help thinking, ìYou know, you are just too large!î            

ìWell!î said Stryver, slapping the desk with his hand, opening his eyes wide,and taking a deep breath. ìIf I understand what youíre saying, Mr. Lorry, thenyou think she will not accept!î            

Mr. Lorry adjusted his little wig at his ears and bit the feather tip of hisquill pen.             

ìDamn it all, sir!î said Stryver. He looked at him intensely. ìArenít I goodenough to marry her?î            

ìOh, dear, yes! Yes, youíre good enough!î said Mr. Lorry. ìIf the question isif youíre good enough, then yes, youíre good enough.î            

ìArenít I successful?î asked Stryver.            

ìOh! If youíre asking if you are successful, then yes. You are successful,îsaid Mr. Lorry.            

ìAnd arenít I becoming more successful?î            

ìIf the question is if youíre becoming more successful, then no one can doubtthat,î said Mr. Lorry, who was thrilled to be able to agree with him.             

ìThen what on earth do you mean, Mr. Lorry?î asked Mr. Stryver, visibly hurt.        

ìWell! Iówere you on your way to Miss Manetteís house right now?î asked Mr.Lorry.            

ìIím going straight there!î said Stryver, with a thump of his fat fist on thedesk.             

ìI think I wouldnít do that if I were you.î            

ìWhy not?î asked Stryver. ìNow I want to know the truth from you.î He pointedhis finger at him and shook it. ìYou are a businessman and you must have areason. Tell me your reason. Why wouldnít you go?î            

ìBecause I wouldnít do such a thing unless I had some reason to think that Iwould succeed,î said Mr. Lorry.             

ìDamn me!î yelled Stryver. ìDoesnít that beat all!î            

Mr. Lorry looked at the head banker in the corner and looked back at Mr.Stryver, who was now angry.             

ìYou are a businessman. You are old and experienced. You work in a bank,î saidMr. Stryver. ìAnd just having told you three good reasons why I should succeed,you say there is no reason at all! You say it with your head on your shoulders!îMr. Stryver commented on it as if it would have been less surprising if he hadsaid it with his head off his shoulders.             

ìWhen I talk about success, Iím talking about success with the young lady. Andwhen I talk about reasons why you would be likely to succeed, I talk aboutreasons that would persuade the young lady. The young lady, my good sir,î saidMr. Lorry tapping Stryver gently on the arm, ìThe young ladyís happiness is themost important thing.î            

ìThen what youíre telling me, Mr. Lorry,î said Stryver turning toward him, ìisthat you think Miss Manette is an idiot?î            

ìNot exactly. What I mean, Mr. Stryver,î said Mr. Lorry, who was turning redin the face, ìis that I will not let anyone speak badly of Miss Manette. If Iknew any manóand I hope I do notówho had such poor taste and such a bad temperthat he couldnít keep himself from speaking badly of Miss Manette here at mydesk, even the fact that we are in Tellsonís Bank wouldnít stop me from tellinghim off.î            

The fact that Mr. Stryver was so angry but had to keep his voice down made hisveins stand out. Mr. Lorryís veins, as calm as they usually were, were just asbad now that it was his turn to speak.             

ìThat is what Iím trying to tell you, sir,î said Mr. Lorry. ìLetís be clearabout that.î            

Mr. Stryver sucked on the end of a ruler for a little while, then stoodtapping the ruler against his teeth, which probably gave him a toothache. Hebroke the awkward silence by saying:            

ìThis is strange to me, Mr. Lorry. You are telling me not to go to MissManetteís house in Soho and offer myself to her. Me! Stryver, the successfullawyer of the Kingís Bench bar?î            

ìAre you asking me for advice, Mr. Stryver?î            

ìYes, I am.î            

ìVery good. Then I have given you my advice and you have repeated itcorrectly.î            

ìAll I can say to that,î laughed Stryver, who was clearly annoyed, ìis thatthisóha, ha! This beats everything!î            

ìNow understand,î continued Mr. Lorry. ìAs a businessman, I am not qualifiedto say anything about this. As a businessman, I know nothing about love andmarriage. But as an old man who carried Miss Manette in his arms when she was ababy, and as a trusted friend of Miss Manette and of her father who cares verymuch for both of them, I have spoken. Remember, I did not come to you with thisadvice. You came to me. Now, do you think I might be wrong?î            

ìNot I!î said Stryver, whistling. ìI canít seem to find third parties withcommon sense. I can only find it in myself. I believe I have sense in certainmatters. You believe nonsense. Itís new to me, but I think you might beright.î            

ìI believe what I believe, Mr. Stryver. And understand, sir,î said Mr. Lorry,quickly turning red again, ì I will notónot even in Tellsonís Bankóhave anotherman alive criticize me for it.î             

ìI beg your pardon!î said Stryver.            

ìThen I give you my pardon. Thank you. Well, Mr. Stryver, I was about to saythat it might hurt to realize that you are wrong. It might hurt Dr. Manette tohave to explain it to you. It might hurt Miss Manette very much to have toexplain it to you. You know that I am lucky enough to have a close relationshipwith the family. If you donít mind, without committing you or representing youin any way, I will try to gather some more information and judge its meaning soI can give you the best advice. If you then disagree with my advice, you can tryit out for yourself. If, on the other hand, you agree with it, it might spareeveryone a lot of trouble. What do you say?î             

ìHow long would I have to stay in town?î            

ìOh! Only a few hours. I could go to the Manetteís house in Soho tonight andcome to your apartment afterward.î            

ìThen I agree,î said Stryver. ìI wonít go there now. Iím not so anxious that Ineed to do that. I agree and I will wait for you to go there tonight. Goodday.î            

Then Mr. Stryver turned away and charged out of Tellsonís Bank. He caused sucha forceful breeze to follow him that it almost knocked over the two old clerks.The two old men were always bowing to the customers on their way out, and manypeople believed that after they had bowed a customer out, they just kept bowingin the empty office until another customer came in and brought them backupright.             

Mr. Stryver was smart enough to realize that the banker wouldnít have said somuch about his opinion unless he were sure of it. As unprepared as he was toreceive Mr. Lorryís unwanted advice, he followed it. ìAnd now,î said Mr.Stryver, pointing his finger and shaking it at all of Temple Bar, ìmy way out ofthis is to prove youíre all wrong.î            

He soothed himself with a trick used by lawyers at the Old Bailey. ìYou wonítprove me wrong, Miss Manette,î said Mr. Stryver. ìIíll prove myselfwrong.î            

So, when Mr. Lorry came to Mr. Stryverís place at ten oíclock that night, Mr.Stryver had surrounded himself with piles of books and papers. He seemed to haveno interest in their conversation from the morning. He even acted surprised whenhe saw Mr. Lorry and pretended to be preoccupied and distracted.             

ìWell!î said Mr. Lorry pleasantly, after spending half an hour tryingunsuccessfully to get Mr. Stryver to bring up the subject. ì I have been toSoho.î            

ìTo Soho?î repeated Mr. Stryver indifferently. ìOh, yes, of course! What was Ithinking?î            

ìAnd Iím sure,î said Mr. lorry, ìthat I was right when we talked this morning.My opinion has been confirmed, and I repeat the same advice to you.î            

ìIím sorry for your sake and sorry for her fatherís sake,î said Mr. Stryver inhis friendliest way. ìI know this must be a difficult subject for the family.Letís not talk about it again.î            

ìI donít understand you,î said Mr. Lorry.            

ìApparently not,î he answered, nodding his head. ìIt doesnít matter.î            

ìBut it does matter,î Mr. Lorry said.             

ìNo it doesnít. I promise you it doesnít. I had thought that Miss Manette wasa sensible, ambitious woman. I was mistaken. But there is no harm done. Youngwomen have made similar mistakes many times before and have been sorry for themwhen they ended up poor and forgotten. In an unselfish way, I am sorry that themarriage is not happening because it would have been bad for me from a practicalpoint of view. In a selfish way, I am glad that itís not happening, because itwould have been bad for me from a practical point of view. Itís obvious that Iwouldnít have gained anything by it. There is no harm done. I havenít proposedto Miss Manette, and, just between you and me, I am not sure, now that I thinkabout it, that I should have even thought about it. Mr. Lorry, you canít controlthe changing fancies of empty-headed girls. You canít expect to, or you willalways be disappointed. Now, please, letís not talk about it anymore. I tellyou, Iím sorry about it for their sake, but I am happy about it for my own sake.I am grateful to you for letting me talk to you about it and for giving me youradvice. You know Miss Manette better than I do. You were right. It never wouldhave worked.î            

Mr. Lorry was so surprised that he stared blankly at Mr. Stryver as Mr.Stryver shoved him toward the front door and pretended to be in a good mood.ìMake the best of it, my dear sir,î said Stryver. ìLetís talk no more about it.Thanks again for allowing me to talk to get your opinion. Good night!î            

Mr. Lorry was standing outside in the darkness before he knew where he was,and Mr. Stryver was lying on his sofa, blinking at the ceiling.             

If Sydney Carton ever made a good impression anywhere, it was certainly neverat Dr. Manetteís house. He had been going there regularly for a whole year, andhe always spent his time there lying around in a grumpy mood. When he saidanything, he spoke well, but his apathy cast a shadow over him, and his goodheart rarely shined through.            

He did, however, like the streets that surrounded the Manettesí house, and thecobblestones that made them up. Many nights he would end up wandering sadlyaround their neighborhood, after drinking wine all night had failed to improvehis mood. Many times he would be wandering near their house at sunrise, andoften he would still be there when the first rays of sun hit the church steepleand tall buildings. Perhaps these quiet mornings made him think happy thoughtsthat he forgot about at other times during the day. Lately, he had spent lesstime than ever in his unmade bed at Temple Court. Often, after he had come homeand thrown himself on it for just a few minutes, he would get up again andwander around the Manettesí neighborhood.             

One day in August, when Mr. Stryver (after telling Mr. Carton that he haddecided not to get married) had gone to Devonshire, Mr. Carton wandered aroundnear the Manetteís house. The sight and smell of flowers in the city gave asense of goodness to even the worst people, a feeling of health to thesickliest, and an air of youth to the oldest. At first Mr. Carton wanderedaimlessly. Then he was struck by an idea. He walked purposefully to Dr.Manetteís door.             

The servant brought him upstairs and he found Lucie working there alone. Shehad never been comfortable when he was around, and she was a little embarrassedwhen he arrived and sat down near her at her table. She looked at his face afterthey exchanged a few pleasantries and noticed that something was different abouthim.            

ìYou look sick, Mr. Carton!î            

ìNo. But I live an unhealthy lifestyle, Miss Manette. What can you expect fromsomeone as decadent as I am?î            

ìForgive me for asking, but wouldnít it be better to live a betterlife?î            

ìGod knows itís a shame that I donít!î            

ìThen why not change the way you live?î            

She looked at him gently again, surprised and sad to see that he was crying.His voice sounded sad, too, as he answered:            

ìItís too late for that. I will never be better than I am now. Iíll only getworse and worse.î            

He leaned his elbow on the table and covered his eyes with his hand. The tabletrembled as he cried on it silently.            

She had never seen him so vulnerable, and it was upsetting to her. He couldtell that she was upset, so without looking at her, he said:            

ìPlease forgive me, Miss Manette. Iím crying because of what Iím about to sayto you. Will you listen to me?î            

ìIf it will make you happy, Mr. Carton, I would be glad to.î            

ìGod bless you for being so kind.î            

After a little while he removed his hand from his face, and he spokesteadily.            

ìDonít be afraid to listen to me. Donít pull away from what I say. I am likesomeone who has died young. My whole life is a missed opportunity.î            

ìNo, Mr. Carton. I bet the best is still to come. Iím sure that you might makeyourself proud.î            

ìThatís nice of you to say, Miss Manette. And although I know it isnít true, Iwill never forget it.î            

She was pale and shaking, and he tried to soothe her. He was filled with amisery and self-loathing that made the conversation unlike any other.             

ìI am a wasteful, drunken, poor, abused creature. If it had been possible foryou to love me, Miss Manette, I would have known that, although I was happy, Iwould only make you unhappy. I would bring you sorrow and regret. I woulddisgrace you and bring you down with me. I know that you have no feelings forme, and I donít ask you to. I am even happy that you donít.î            

ìCanít I help you, even though I donít love you, Mr. Carton? Forgive me, butcanít I help you put your life on a better path? Canít I repay your trust in me?I know you are putting trust in me by telling me this,î she said modestly afterhesitating a bit, with genuine tears. ìI know that you wouldnít tell anyone elsethis. Canít I turn this into something that will help you, Mr. Carton?î            

He shook his head.            

ìYou canít help me at all. No, Miss Manette. If you will listen to me a littlewhile longer, you will have done everything you could do for me. I want you toknow that you have been my last hope. I havenít been so lost that the sight ofyou with your father, and of this house that youíve made into a home, has mademe remember things that I thought I had forgotten forever. Since Iíve known you,I have been bothered by a remorse that I thought would never bother me again. Ihave heard voices encouraging me to be better that I thought had disappearedforever. I have had vague thoughts about starting over again. I have imaginedmyself giving up laziness and sin and fighting for whatís right in the world.Itís all a dream, of course, that wonít amount to anything. But I want you toknow that you inspired me to have these thoughts.î             

ìNothing will come of it? Oh, Mr. Carton, think about it again! Try to startover!î            

ìNo, Miss Manette. All this time I have known that I do not deserve it. Andyet I have been weak enough, and still am weak enough, to want you to know howyou took me, a poor, broken man, and made me want to be a better man. But still,I will only waste away and amount to nothing.î            

ìSince I have caused you to be more unhappy than you were before you knew me,Mr. Cartonóî            

ìDonít say that, Miss Manette. If anyone could have saved me, it would havebeen you. You will not be the reason I get worse.î            

ìSince the condition that you have described is partly my faultóthatís whatyou mean, if I can say it plainlyócanít I be of service to you? Am I not able tohelp you at all?î            

ìThe most good that I can do now, Miss Manette, is why I have come here. Letme live the rest of my wasteful life knowing that I told you my feelings andthat there was still something left in me now worth pitying.î            

ìI beg you again and again to believe that you are able to do better thingswith your life, Mr. Carton!î            

ìDonít beg me to believe it anymore, Miss Manette. I know what I am. Iímupsetting you, so I will finish what I have to say. Will you let me believe,when I remember this day, that I told you the last secret of my life and thatyou kept it? And that no one will ever know about it?î            

ìIf that will bring you comfort, yes.î            

ìNot even the person you love the most?î            

ìMr. Carton,î she answered after pausing nervously, ìitís your secret, notmine. I promise to respect that and to tell no one.î            

ìThank you. And again, God bless you.î            

He kissed her hand and walked toward the door.             

ìDonít worry. I will never continue this conversation with you again, MissManette. I will never mention it. That couldnít be more certain than if I weredead. When I die, I will cherish my one good memory. I shall thank and bless youfor the fact that the last good words I spoke about myself were spoken to you.And that my name, my faults, and my cares were told to you. Otherwise I hope youare happy and carefree!î             

He was acting so unlike he ever had before, and it was so sad to think aboutwhat he threw away with his wasted and debauched life, that Lucie Manette criedfor him. He stood there looking at her.             

ìTake comfort!î he said. ìI am not worth crying over, Miss Manette. An hour ortwo from now, when I join my lowlife friends and their sinful habits, I will beless worth your tears than any poor wretch on the streets. Take comfort! But inmy heart, when I think of you, I will always be the man I am now, although onthe outside I will be the man you have always known me to be. My last request isthat you will believe this.î             

ìI will, Mr. Carton.î            

ìI will leave soon, freeing you from me. You and I have nothing in common, andthere is a wide gap between us. But this is my last request. It is useless tosay it, I know, but I canít help myself. I would do anything for you or thepeople you care about. If I were capable of making a sacrifice for you, I wouldsacrifice anything for you or the people you love. Think of me now and again, inquiet times, and know that I mean what I say. Sometime soon you will get marriedand have a family. Oh, Miss Manette, when you look down one day and see theresemblance of your husbandís face in your child smiling up at you, or when yousee a beautiful little girl like yourself at your feet, remember now and thenthat there is a man who would die to keep someone you love beside you.î             

He said a final ìFarewell, God bless you!î and left.             

Mr. Jeremiah Cruncher saw many different things move past him as he sat on hisstool on Fleet Street, with his grubby little son beside him. Who could sit onFleet Street during the busy hours of the day and not be overwhelmed by thenoise and sight of the two great streams of people going about their day? Onewas always heading west, and the other always heading east. Both were alwaysheading toward the valleys past where the sun sets.             

Mr. Cruncher sat watching the two streams with a straw in his mouth, lookinglike a country farmer who has sat for hundreds of years keeping watch over onestream. Jerry, though, didnít expect that the stream would ever dry up. Hewouldnít want it to dry up, since a small amount of his income came from helpingtimid, well-dressed older women cross from Tellson Bankís side of the street tothe other side. As short as these encounters were, Mr. Cruncher always became sofriendly with these women that he would tell them that he wanted to drink totheir health. They gave him money to do just that, adding to his income.            

There was a time when a poet might sit on a stool in public and contemplatethe men he saw. Mr. Cruncher, sitting on his stool in public, wasnít a poet. Hethought as little as possible and just looked around.             

He happened to be sitting and staring at a time when there werenít many peopleout, so there were very few women to help across the street. He was doing sopoorly that he started to suspect that his wife must have been praying againsthim. Just then an unusual group came hurrying down Fleet Street heading west.Mr. Cruncher looked their way and could see some kind of funeral moving along.He could tell that people were angry about it.             

ìYoung Jerry,î said Mr. Cruncher, turning to his son. ìItís a funeral.î            

ìHooray, Father!î cried Young Jerry.             

The boy yelled his cheer with mysterious significance. His father was so upsetby his cheer that he waited until no one was looking and then smacked the boy onthe ear.             

ìWhat do you mean? What are you hooraying at? What are you trying to tell yourfather, you young punk? This boy is too much for me!î said Mr. Cruncher, lookingat his son. ìHim and his hoorays! Donít let me hear any more out of you or Iíllhit you again. Do you hear me?î            

ìI wasnít doing anything wrong,î protested Young Jerry, rubbing his cheek.        

ìStop it then,î said Mr. Cruncher. ìI donít want to hear you say you didnothing wrong. Get up on that stool and look at the crowd.î            

His son obeyed, and the crowd came closer. They were crying and wailing arounda dingy hearse and a dingy funeral coach. There was only one mourner in thefuneral coach. He was dressed in the dingy mourning clothes consideredappropriate for the situation. He didnít seem happy to be there, though, as themob was growing larger around the coach. They were making fun of him and makingfaces at him. They kept yelling out, ìYah! Spies! Tst! Yaha! Spies!î with manyother insults too offensive to repeat.             

Mr. Cruncher always liked funerals. He always paid close attention to them andgot excited when a funeral went past Tellsonís Bank. Naturally, therefore, hewas especially excited about a funeral with such an unusual crowd following it.He asked the first man who ran into him:            

ìWhatís happening, my friend? Whatís it all about?î            

ìI donít know,î said the man. The man went back to yelling at the coach,ìSpies! Yaha! Tst! Spies!î            

He asked another man. ìWho is it?î            

ìI donít know,î answered the other man. Still, he cupped his hands around hismouth and loudly shouted, ìSpies! Yaha! Tst, tst! Spióies!î            

After a while, a person with more information ran into him. This person toldMr. Cruncher that the funeral was of a man named Roger Cly.            

ìWas he a spy?î asked Mr. Cruncher.            

ìHe was an Old Bailey spy,î answered the man. He went on yelling at the coach,ìYaha! Tst! Yah! Old Bailey spióióies!î            

ìWhy, of course!î said Jerry, remembering the trial he had helped with. ìIíveseen him. Is he dead?î            

ìDead as muttonmeat from a sheepmutton,î answered the other man. ìAnd he canít be too dead. Have íem out!Spies! Pull them out! Spies!î            

The mob thought that this was a good idea, since it was the only idea anyonehad suggested. They all started repeating the manís suggestion to ìhave íem outand pull íem out.î They pushed so close to the two vehicles that they came to astop. Once the crowd opened the doors of the coach, the one mourner came out byhimself and was taken by the crowd for a moment. He was so quick, though, that amoment later he had gotten away from them and was running down a side streetafter slipping out of his coat, hat, long hat band, white handkerchief, andother symbols of mourning.             

The crowd tore his clothes to pieces and threw them around happily. Theshopkeepers nearby quickly closed up their shops, for in those days mobs stoppedat nothing and could cause a lot of destruction. They had already gone so far asto open the hearse to take the coffin out when some genius suggested insteadthat they bring it to its destination while they celebrate the death. Sincethere werenít many good ideas being suggested, this too was accepted happily bythe mob. Immediately, the coach was filled with eight people inside and twelveoutside, while as many people as could fit climbed onto the roof. Among thefirst to do so was Jerry Cruncher, who covered his spiked head of hair in thefar corner of the mourning coach so that no one from Tellsonís Bank wouldrecognize him.            

The undertakers in charge complained about this takeover of the funeralprocession. The river, however, was dangerously close by, and several members ofthe crowd mentioned how effective a dunking in cold water could be in gettingstubborn officials to change their minds. The undertakers didnít complain toomuch after that. The new procession started with a chimneysweep driving thehearse, with the regular driver sitting beside him and directing him. The piemaker, aided by his cabinet minister, drove the mourning coach. A bear leadera person with a bear who performed for moneybear leader, who was apopular type of street person in London back then, joined the crowd before theyhad gotten very far down the Strand. His bear, which was black and mangy, causedan air of seriousness in his part of the procession.             

Thus the procession continued down the street, with the crowd drinking beer,smoking pipes, singing songs, and some people doing mocking impressions ofpeople in mourning. More and more people joined the mob as it went, and all theshops closed as it approached. It was heading for the old church of SaintPancras, far off in the country. Eventually it arrived there, and the crowdinsisted on all going into the burial ground. There they finally buried the deadRoger Cly as they wanted, and to their great satisfaction.             

With the dead man buried, and the crowd needing some other entertainment foritself, another genius (or perhaps the same one) had the idea of accusingunsuspecting passers-by of being Old Bailey spies and harassing them. The mobchased down dozens of innocent people who had never even been near the OldBailey in their lives and knocked them around and abused them. The transition tobreaking windows and robbing pubs came easily and naturally. Finally, afterseveral hours, when several summerhouses had been pulled down and some fenceshad been broken and used as weapons by some of the more violent people, a rumorstarted that the Guards were coming. As the rumor spread, the crowd started todisperse. The Guards may or may not have actually ever come, but this is howmobs usually ended.             

Mr. Cruncher didnít take part in the final events, but had stayed at thechurchyard to talk with the undertakers. The churchyard was calming to him. Hegot a pipe from a nearby pub and smoked it as he looked at the fences andthoughtfully considered the graveyard.             

ìJerry,î said Mr. Cruncher, talking to himself in his usual way. ìYou saw thatCly man that day at the Old Bailey. You saw with your own eyes that he was ayoung, respectable-looking man.î            

He finished his pipe and thought to himself awhile longer. Then he turnedaround and headed back so that he would be seen at his place outside ofTellsonís Bank at closing time. Whether his thoughts on death had made him feelsick, or whether he had been feeling unhealthy before that, or whether he wantedto pay a visit to an important man doesnít matter. What matters is that he madea short visit to his doctor, a respected surgeon, on his way back.             

Young Jerry had covered for his father in his absence and told him that therehad been no work while he was gone. The bank closed, the old clerks came out,the watchmen took their place, and Mr. Cruncher and his son went home to tea.        

ìI tell you, now,î Mr. Cruncher told his wife as he came in, ìif, as an honestbusinessman, my plans go wrong tonight, Iíll know that you have been prayingagainst me and Iíll punish you for it just the same as if Iíd seen you doit.î            

The unhappy Mrs. Cruncher shook her head.             

ìWhy, youíre doing it in front of my face!î said Mr. Cruncher, angry andanxious.             

ìIím not saying anything.î            

ìWell, then, donít think anything either. You might as well kneel down andpray as think. You might as well betray me one way or another. Just stop italtogether.î            

ìYes, Jerry,î said his wife.            

ìëYes, Jerry,íî repeated Mr. Cruncher sitting down to his tea. ìAh! Thatísright. ëYes, Jerry.í Thatís about all you are allowed to say. You may say ëYes,Jerry.íî            

Mr. Cruncher didnít mean anything particular with these words, but he usedthem sarcastically, as people often do, to express unhappiness.            

ìYou and your ëYes, Jerry,íî said Mr. Cruncher, taking a bite of his bread andbutter. He seemed to take an invisible oyster out of his saucer and eat it. ìAh!I think so. I believe you.î            

ìYouíre going out tonight?î asked his decent wife after he had taken anotherbite.î            

ìYes, I am.î            

ìCan I go with you, Father?î asked his son quickly.             

ìNo, you canít. Iím going fishing, as your mother knows. Thatís where Iímgoing. Iím going fishing.î            

ìYour fishing rod gets pretty rusty, doesnít it, Father?î            

ìNever mind that.î            

ìAre you going to bring any fish home, Father?î            

ìIf I donít, youíll have very little food tomorrow,î answered his father,shaking his head. ìThatís enough questions from you. Iím not going out untilyouíve been in bed for a long time.î            

He spent the rest of the night watching Mrs. Cruncher closely. He kept talkingto her so that she wouldnít have time to think any evil thoughts about him. Hetold his son to keep talking to her too for the same reason, and he harassed thewoman by talking about all the complaints he had against her rather than leaveher to her own thoughts for a moment. The most religious person couldnít havebelieved more in the power of honest prayer than he believed in his wifeísplotting against him. It was as if a person who says he doesnít believe inghosts were frightened by a ghost story.             

ìAnd remember!î said Mr. Cruncher. ì Donít play around tomorrow! If I, anhonest businessman, am able to put a joint of meat on the table, you wonítdecide to not eat it and only eat bread. And if I, an honest businessman, amable to get a little bit of beer, you wonít decide to only drink water. When inRome, do as the Romans do. Rome will treat you poorly if you donít.    I am your Rome, you know.             

Then he began mumbling again:            

ìYou, turning down your own food and drink! I donít know why you make it sohard for me to find food and drink, with your kneeling and praying and heartlessbehavior. Look at our son. He is your son, isnít he? Heís asthin as a board. You call yourself a mother? Donít you know that a motherísfirst duty is to make her son fat and healthy?î            

Young Jerry was moved by this, and he begged his mother to perform the firstduty of a mother and, whatever other parental duties she neglected, to putspecial emphasis on making him fat and healthy.             

This is how the Cruncher family spent the evening until Young Jerry was sentto bed. Mr. Cruncher also sent Mrs. Cruncher to bed, and she obeyed. Mr.Cruncher spent the early part of the night smoking pipes alone and didnít go outon his errand until nearly one oíclock in the morning. Around that time, he gotup from his chair, took a key out of his pocket, opened a locked cupboard, andtook out a sack, a large crowbar, a rope, a chain, and other ìfishingequipment.î Gathering these things about him, he muttered a last insult to Mrs.Cruncher, put out the light, and went out.             

Young Jerry, who had only pretended to undress when he was sent to bed, snuckout and followed his father. Hidden by the darkness, he followed him out of theroom, down the stairs, through the courtyard, and into the streets. He wasnítworried about getting back into the house again without a key. There were manylodgers staying there, and the front door was always left ajar all night.            

Young Jerry was driven by a wish to learn the skills and secrets his father ofhis fatherís ìhonestî work. He kept close to the house fronts, walls, anddoorways as he kept his eyes on his father. His father was heading north and hadnot gone far when he was joined by another follower of Izaak Waltonan English writer who wrote about fishingIzaak Walton, and the two men walkedon together.             

Within half an hour from when they set out, they were beyond the street lampsand the sleeping watchmen and were out on a deserted road. Another ìfishermanîwas picked up there. He joined them so quietly that if Young Jerry had beensuperstitious he might have thought that the second follower had actually splitin two and become two people.             

The three men continued on, and Young Jerry followed them, until the threestopped under a bank hanging out over the road. On the top of the bank there wasa low brick wall, and on top of the wall was an iron railing. In the shadow ofthe bank and wall the three men turned into a hidden lane. The wall, which wasabout eight or ten feet high there, formed one side of the lane. Young Jerrycrouched down in a corner and peeked into the lane. The next thing Young Jerrysaw was his father in the moonlight. He was climbing an iron gate and soon hadclimbed over it. Then the second, and then the third man also climbed over it.They all landed quietly on the ground on the other side of the gate and liedthere a littleólistening perhaps. Then they crawled away on their hands andknees.             

It was Young Jerryís turn to go over to the gate, and he did it holding hisbreath. Crouching down in a corner again, he looked in and saw the three mencrawling through some dirty grass. They were in a large churchyard. All of thegravestones looked like white ghosts that were watching them, and the churchtower looked the ghost of an ugly giant. They hadnít crawled far when theystopped and stood up. Then they began to dig.             

First they dug with a shovel. Shortly after, Mr. Cruncher appeared to be usingsome sort of tool like a large corkscrew. Whatever tools they used, they workedhard until the chimes of the churchís clock struck. The sound scared Young Jerryso much that he ran off with his hair sticking up like his fatherís.             

But Young Jerry was so anxious to know what the men were doing that he stoppedand went back again. The men were still digging when he peeked in through thegate a second time. They seemed to have found something. There was a noise likea screw being turned coming from the ground, and the menís fingers strained asif they were lifting something heavy. Little by little the heavy object brokethrough the dirt and came to the surface. Young Jerry knew very well what itwas. When he saw it, and saw his father about to open it, he was so scared sinceheíd never seen anything like that before that he ran away again. He didnít stoprunning until he had run a mile or more.             

He wouldnít even have stopped then if he hadnít run out of breath. It was likehe was running a ghostly race and he desperately wanted to reach the finishline. He felt like the coffin he had seen was chasing him, and he imagined ithopping behind him, standing upright on its narrow end. It was always close tocatching him and was sometimes hopping right beside him. He imagined it grabbinghis arm, and he wanted to get away from it. It seemed to be everywhere at once.He ran out into the road and avoided dark alleys, fearing it would come hoppingout after him like a boyís kite without its tail and wings. He imagined ithiding in doorways too. It would rub its shoulders against doors and lift themup to its ears as if it were laughing. It came out of the shadows on the roadand lied on its back to trip him. All this time he still pictured it hoppingbehind him and gaining on him, so when Young Jerry got to his front door he wasso tired he was half dead. But even then it wouldnít leave him alone. Heimagined that it followed him up the stairs and into his bedroom, climbed intobed with him, and still wouldnít leave him alone in his sleep.             

Young Jerry was woken up from his disturbed sleep in his little room by thesound of his father in the family room. It was after daybreak and beforesunrise. Something had gone wrong for his father. At least thatís what YoungJerry assumed, since he was holding Mrs. Cruncher by the ears and knocking theback of her head against the headboard of their bed.             

ìI told you I would,î said Mr. Cruncher, ìand I did.î            

ìJerry, Jerry, Jerry!î his wife begged.             

ìYou pray that Iíll fail in my business dealings,î said Jerry, ìand then mypartners and I suffer. Youíre supposed to honor and obey your husband. Why thedevil wonít you?î            

ìI try to be a good wife, Jerry,î the poor woman argued, crying.            

ìIs it being a good wife to sabotage your husbandís business? Is it honoringyour husband to dishonor his business? Is it obeying your husband to disobey himon the important subject of his work?î            

ìYou hadnít started this terrible work back when I made those vows,Jerry.î            

ìYou should be satisfied to be married to an honest businessman,î snapped Mr.Cruncher. ìDonít concern your female mind with thoughts about when he was doinghis job and when he wasnít. A wife who honored and obeyed her husband wouldleave his work alone altogether. You call yourself a religious woman? If youírea religious woman, give me an irreligious woman! You have no more natural senseof duty than the bottom of the Thames River has of a wooden beam, and just likethat beam, some sense needs to be knocked into you.î            

They argued quietly, until Mr. Cruncher kicked off his clay-covered boots andlied down on the floor. After taking a nervous peek at him lying on his back,with his rust-covered hands under his head for a pillow, Young Jerry lay downtoo and fell asleep again.             

There was no fish for breakfast, or much of anything else. Mr. Cruncher was ina bad mood, and he kept an iron pot lid near him in case he saw Mrs. Crunchersaying grace and wanted to throw it at her. He brushed his hair and washed up atthe usual time and went off to work with his son.             

Young Jerry walked with the stool under his arm beside his father. They walkedalong Fleet Street, which was sunny and crowded. Young Jerry was very differentthan he had been the night before when he had run away from the coffin throughthe darkness alone. He was sharp again in the daylight, and his fears had leftwith the night. Its very possible that other people on Fleet Street and in otherparts of London felt the same way that beautiful morning.             

ìFather,î said Young Jerry as they walked along together. He made sure to keephis father at armís length and to hold the stool between them. ìWhatís aresurrection man?î             

Mr. Cruncher stopped on the sidewalk before he answered. ìHow should Iknow?î            

ìI thought you knew everything, Father,î said Young Jerry pretendingunconvincingly.            

ìHmm. Well,î answered Mr. Cruncher, starting to walk again and taking his hatoff to let his spiked hair out. ìHeís a businessman.î            

ìWhat merchandise does he trade in, Father?î asked the quick YoungJerry.            

ìHis merchandise,î said Mr. Cruncher after thinking it over, ìis of ascientific kind.î            

ìPeopleís bodies, isnít it, Father?î asked the boy, excited.            

ìI think itís something like that,î said Mr. Cruncher.            

ìOh, Father, I want to be a resurrection man when I grow up!î            

Mr. Cruncher felt better, but he shook his head in a doubtful and moralizingway. ìThat depends on how you develop your skills. If you work at developingyour skills, and you donít say anymore to anybody than you have to, thereís notelling what you might be good at.î Young Jerry was encouraged by this andwalked a few yards ahead to place the stool in the shadow of Temple Bar. Mr.Cruncher said to himself, ìJerry, you honest businessman, thereís a chance thatthe boy will be good luck to you after all and will make up for his mother!î        

People had started drinking earlier than usual at Monsieur Defargeís wineshop. As early as six oíclock in the morning, sickly faces looking into theshopís barred windows had seen the faces of other people inside, hunched overtheir wine glasses. Monsieur Defarge sold very weak wine even when things weregoing well, but nowadays his wine was especially weak. Moreover, his wine tastedsour and made the people who drank it sour and depressed. Monsieur Defargeíswine didnít fire them with a BacchanalianBacchus was the Roman god of wineBacchanalian flame, but instead filled them with a low, intenseheat.            

This was the third morning in a row that the drinking had started early atMonsieur Defargeís wine shop. It started on Monday, and now it was Wednesday.The patrons had been doing more worrying than drinking, for many men had beenthere listening, whispering, and wandering around since the doors opened whocouldnít have afforded to buy a cup of wine if their lives depended on it. Thesemen were as eager to be there as if they could afford entire barrels of wine.They moved from chair to chair, from one corner to the other, eagerly drinkingin the conversation in place of wine.            

Even though there were more people there than usual, Monsieur Defarge wasnowhere to be seen. No one missed him, though, and nobody that came into theshop looked for him or asked where he was. No one thought it was strange to seeMadame Defarge sitting alone serving wine. She had a bowl in front of her filledwith old coins that were as worn and beaten up as the people who had owned them.        

Apathy and boredom might have been what the spies who stopped into the wineshop saw. The spies stopped in at every place, of the highest or lowest class,from the royal palace to the jail. Card games dragged on, people built towersout of dominoes, and customers drew shapes on the tables with spilled drops ofwine. Even Madame Defarge traced the pattern on her sleeve with a toothpick andstared off into the distance.             

This is how it was in the wine shop in Saint Antoine until the middle of theday. At noon, two men covered in dust came walking through the streets under theswinging streetlamps. One of them was Monsieur Defarge. The other was a manwearing a blue cap who repaired roads. Dusty and thirsty, the two men enteredthe wine shop. Their arrival had sparked some excitement in Saint Antoine, whichspread as they came through town and could be seen in the faces of thetownspeople watching them from their doors and windows. No one followed themdown the street, however, and no one in the wine shop said anything when theycame in, although everyone there was watching them.             

ìGood day, gentlemen!î said Monsieur Defarge.            

Saying this may have been a signal to let everyone know they could speak.Together everyone answered, ìGood day!î            

ìThe weather is bad, gentlemen,î said Defarge, shaking his head.            

When he said this, all the men looked at each other, then they looked at theground and sat in silence. Except for one man, who got up and left.             

ìMy wife,î said Defarge out loud, speaking to Madame Defarge. ìI have traveledsome distance with this repairer of roads named Jacques. I met him by chance aday and halfís travel outside of Paris. He is a good kid, this repairer of roadsnamed Jacques. Give him a drink, my wife!î            

Another man got up and left. Madame Defarge put a glass of wine in front ofthe repairer of roads named Jacques. He tipped his blue cap to everyone anddrank. In his shirt he had some rough, dark bread. He ate from it now and againand sat eating and drinking at Madame Defargeís counter. A third man got up andleft.            

Monsieur Defarge refreshed himself with a cup of wine. He took less than wasgiven to the stranger, since wine was something that was always available tohim. He stood waiting until Jacques had finished his breakfast. Monsieur Defargedidnít look directly at anyone there, and no one looked at him, not even hiswife, who was now busy knitting.             

ìHave you finished your meal, my friend?î asked Monsieur Defarge after awhile.            

ìYes, thank you.î            

ìCome on, then! Iíll show you the apartment I said you could stay in. Itísperfect for you.î            

They left the wine shop and went out into the street, then into a courtyard,up a steep staircase, and up into an attic. This was the same attic where Dr.Manette once sat on a bench, stooped over, busily making shoes.             

Dr. Manette wasnít there anymore. Instead, the three men who had left the wineshop one by one were all there. Between these men and Dr. Manette there was onesmall connection, though, for the men had all once watched him through the holesin these walls.            

Defarge carefully closed the door and said quietly:             

ìJacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! This is the witness that I, JacquesFour, went to meet. He will tell you everything. Tell them, JacquesFive!î            

The repairer of roads wiped his dark brow with his blue cap and said, ìWhereshould I begin, monsieur?î            

ìBegin at the beginning,î was Monsieur Defargeís sensible reply.             

ìI saw a man, messieurs,î said the repairer of roads, ìa year ago this summer,hiding under the marquisís carriage, hanging by a chain. Listen to how ithappened. I had just finished working on a road and was leaving. The sun wassetting, and the marquisís carriage was slowly climbing up a hill and the manwas hanging beneath it by a chainólike this.î            

The repairer of roads acted it all out again. He ought to have perfected hisact by then, since he had been entertaining his village with it for the wholeyear.            

Jacques One jumped in and asked if he had ever seen the man before.             

ìNever,î answered the repairer of roads, standing up straight again.             

Jacques Three wanted to know how he was able to recognize him if he had neverseen him before.            

ìHe was very tall,î said the repairer of roads quietly, with his finger on hisnose. ìWhen the marquis asked me that night what the man looked like, Ianswered, ìAs tall as a ghost.î            

ìYou should have said as short as a dwarf,î answered Jacques Two.             

ìBut how was I to know? The deed hadnít been committed yet. And the man didníttell me what he was going to do. Look! Even then, I didnít offer up mystatement. The marquis pointed me out with his finger while I was standing nearour little fountain. He says, ëBring that rascal to me!í On my word, messieurs,I didnít offer up any information.î            

ìHeís right there, Jacques,î mumbled Defarge to the man who had interrupted.ìGo on!î            

ìGood!î said the repairer of roads mysteriously. ìThe tall man disappeared.Theyíve been looking for him for how many months? Nine? Ten? Eleven?î            

ìThe number of months doesnít matter,î said Defarge. ìHe is well hidden, butunfortunately heís finally been found. Go on!î            

ìOnce again I was working up on the hillside and the sun was about to set. Iwas collecting my tools to go back to my cottage in the village below where itwas already dark. I looked up and I saw six soldiers coming over the hill. Inthe middle of them was a tall man, and his arms were tied to his sidesólikethis!î            

With the help of his cap, he showed them how the man had his elbows bound tohis sides with a rope that was tied behind him.             

ìI stood there, messieurs, by my pile of stones, and watched the soldiers andtheir prisoner walk past. The road is isolated so anything that happens there isworth watching. At first, as they got closer, I didnít notice anything besidesthe fact that they were six soldiers with a tall man who was tied up. They weresilhouetted against the sun, so they appeared only as black outlines, except onthe side the sun was setting on, where they were edged in red, messieurs. Also,I could see their shadows on the hollow ridge on the other side of the road andon the hill above it. Their shadows were long and looked like the shadows ofgiants. Also, I saw that they were covered in dust and that they were kicking updust as they walked closer. But when they got very close to me I recognized thetall man and he recognized me. Oh, he would have been happy to jump over thehillside again the way he had the night when he and I first met, close to thatsame place!î            

He described it as if he were there, and it was obvious that he saw it allclearly. Perhaps he hadnít seen much else excitement in his life.             

ìI didnít let the soldiers see that I recognized the tall man, and he didnítlet them see that he recognized me. We did all of it with our eyes. ëCome on!ísaid the leader of the group, pointing to the village. ëBring him quickly to hisgrave!í At that, they started walking faster. I followed. His arms were swollenfrom being tied up so tightly, and his wooden shoes were large and awkward. Hewas limping, walking slowly because of this, and the soldiers were prodding himforward with their gunsólike this!î            

He showed them how the man was pushed forward by the butt ends of themuskets.            

ìAs they went down the hill like mad men running a race, the tall man fell.The soldiers laughed and picked him up again. His face was bleeding and coveredwith dust, but he couldnít touch it. So they laughed at him again. They broughthim to the village, and all the villagers came running to look at him. Thesoldiers took him past the mill and up to the prison. All the villagers watchedthe prison gate open in the darkness of the night and the tall man go inside. Itlooked like the prison gate swallowed himólike this!î            

He opened his mouth wide and then shut it quickly, making a snapping soundwith his teeth. Seeing that the man didnít want to ruin the effect by openinghis mouth again, Defarge said, ìGo on, Jacques.î            

ìAll of the villagers left,î continued the repairer of roads. He was on histiptoes and speaking quietly. ìAll of them whispered by the fountain. All ofthem went to sleep. All of them dreamed of the poor man, locked up behind barsin the prison on the hill, and never to come out again except to be executed. Inthe morning, carrying my tools on my shoulder, eating a bit of black bread as Iwent, I walked by the prison on my way to work. I saw him there, high up, behindthe bars of an iron cage. He was looking out, covered in blood and dust, as hewas the night before. His hands werenít free so he couldnít wave to me, and Iwas afraid to call out to him. He looked at me like he were alreadydead.î            

Defarge and the three men looked at one another. Their looks were angry andhate filled as they listened to the manís story. Although they were secretive,they all had a commanding presence. They looked like three judges. Jacques Oneand Two were sitting on an old pallet bed, and they both had their chins ontheir hands and their eyes focused closely on the repairer of roads. JacquesThree, equally focused on the man, was on one knee behind them. He kept runninghis hand over his mouth and nose. Defarge was standing between them and the mantelling the story, whom he had placed in the light of the window. He keptlooking back and forth from the repairer of roads to the other men.            

ìGo on, Jacques,î said Defarge.             

ìHe was up in his iron cage for several days. The villagers looked at himsecretly, for they were all afraid, but they kept looking up at him from faraway. At night, when everyone had finished working for the day and had gatheredto gossip at the fountain, everyone would look at the prison. Before, everyonefaced the posting house. Now, they faced the prison. They would whisper at thefountain that although the man had been sentenced to death, he would not bekilled. They would say that a petition had been presented in Paris that provedthat he had been driven insane by the death of his child. They say that apetition had been presented to the king himself. What do I know? Itís possible.Maybe yes, maybe no.î            

ìListen then, Jacques,î Jacques One interrupted sternly. ìKnow that a petitionwas presented to the king and queen. Everyone here, except you, saw the kingtake it while he was in his carriage in the street, sitting next to the queen.It was Defarge, this man here, who, risking his life, ran out in front of thehorses with the petition in his hand.î            

ìAnd listen again, Jacques,î said Jacques Three, who was kneeling down. Hekept running his fingers over his face in a noticeably greedy way, as if hungryfor something besides food and drink. ìThe guards, on horse and on foot,surrounded Defarge as he presented the petition and beat him.Understand?î            

ìI understand, messieurs.î            

ìGo on then,î said Defarge.            

ìOn the other hand, there are also rumors at the fountain,î continued the man,ìthat he has been brought down here to be executed right away and that he willdefinitely be killed. There are even rumors that because he killed a marquis whoruled over his serfsa farmer who cultivated land owned by someone else and who was bought and sold with the landserfs, he islike a father to his serfs and the tall man will be executed for parricidekilling a parentparricide. One old manat the fountain said that his right hand, holding a knife, will be burned off in front of his eyes.He said theyíd make wounds in his arms, chest, and legs and pour boiling oil, melted lead,hot resin, wax, and sulfur into them. Finally, they will tear his arms and legs off by four strong horses. The old man said that all of this was actually done to a prisoner who tried to assassinate the last king, Louis the Fifteenth. But how should I know if heís telling the truth? Iím not a scholar.î            

ìListen once again then, Jacques!î said the man who kept touching his facegreedily with his hand. ìThe name of that prisoner was Damiens. It was all donein broad daylight, publicly, in the streets of Paris. Nothing was more noticedin the large crowd that saw it than the group of upper-class ladies who wereeager and excited to see the whole thing through to the very end. To the veryend, Jacques, which didnít happen until nighttime, when he had lost two legs andan arm but was still breathing. And it was doneówait, how old are you?î            

ìIím thirty-five,î said the repairer of roads, who looked sixty.             

ìIt was done when you were over ten years old. Maybe you saw it.î            

ìEnough!î said Defarge impatiently. ìLong live the devil! Continue.î            

ìWell! Some say this and some say that. They donít talk about anything else.Even the fountain seems to be whispering about it. After a while, on a Sundaynight when all the villagers were asleep, some soldiers came down from theprison. You could hear their guns tapping on the street as they marched. Workmendug and hammered, and soldiers laughed and sang. In the morning, there was agallows built forty feet high near the fountain.î             

The repairer of roads seemed to look through the ceiling. He pointed as if hecould see the gallows off in the sky.            

ìEveryone stopped working and gathered there. Nobody took the cows out. Thecows were there with everyone else. At midday there was a drum roll. Soldiershad marched into the prison at night, and the tall man was now with thesoldiers. Heís tied up like he was before, and there was a gag in his mouth,tied with a tight string that made him look like he was laughing.î The manshowed them what he looked like by putting his thumbs in the corners of hismouth and pulling them back toward his ears. ìOn the top of the gallows they hadattached the knife that killed the marquis. The blade was pointing up toward theair. They hanged him there forty feet in the air, and his body is still hanging,poisoning the water of the fountain.î            

The men all looked at each other. The man had started sweating while he toldthe story, and he used his blue cap to wipe his face.             

ìItís terrible, messieurs. How can women and children fetch water from thefountain? Who can gather and gossip there now that a man has been killed there?When I left the village Monday evening, as the sun was setting, I looked backfrom the hill and the shadow of the man hanging from the gallows fell across thechurch, the mill, and the prison. It seemed to fall across the whole world,messieurs!î            

The greedy man chewed on one of his fingers as he looked at the other three,and his finger shook with a hunger for something other than food.             

ìThatís all, messieurs. I left at sunset as I had been told to do, and Iwalked the rest of the night and half of the next day until I met this man here,as I was told. I came with him, sometimes riding a horse and sometimes walking,through the rest of yesterday and last night. And here I am!î            

After a gloomy silence, Jacques One said, ìGood! You have done the right thingand have told your story well. Will you wait for us a little whileoutside?î            

ìOf course,î said the repairer of roads. Defarge brought him to the top of thestairs, left him sitting there, and came back.             

The three men had gotten up and were standing together when Defarge came backinto the attic.            

ìWhat do you say, Jacques?î asked Jacques One. ìShould we put them on thelist?î            

ìTo be put on the list and destroyed,î answered Defarge.             

ìWonderful!î said the greedy man.            

ìThe chateau and the whole family?î asked Jacques One.            

ìThe chateau and the whole family,î answered Defarge. ìExtermination.î            

The hungry man said ìWonderful!î again and began chewing another finger.        

ìAre you sure,î Jacques asked Defarge, ìthat no embarrassment can come fromour way of keeping the list? Iím sure itís safe, since no one but us can decodeit. But will we always be able to decode it? Or, I should say, will    she?î            

ìJacques,î answered Defarge standing up straight, ìeven if my wife took on thejob of keeping the list only in her memory, she wouldnít forget a word of it!Not a single syllable. She has knitted it herself in her own code, and it willalways be as clear to her as the sun. You can trust Madame Defarge. It would beeasier for the weakest coward to take his own life than it would be to erase oneletter of his name or crimes from the list that Madame Defarge isknitting.î            

The men all mumbled approvingly. Then the hungry man asked, ìAre we going tosend the repairer of roads back home soon? I hope so. He isnít very smart. Isníthe a bit dangerous?î            

ìHe doesnít know anything,î said Defarge. ìAt least nothing more than whatwould get him hanged, too. Iíll take responsibility for him. Let him stay withme. Iíll take care of him and then send him on his way. He wants to see theworld of the upper classes: the king, the queen, and the court. Let him see themon Sunday.î            

ìWhat?î shouted the hungry man, staring at him. ìIsnít it a bad sign that hewants to see royalty and nobility?î            

ìJacques,î said Defarge. ìShow a cat just a little bit of milk if you want itto thirst for it. Show a dog his natural prey if you want it to hunt it oneday.î            

They didnít say anything else. They found the repairer of roads asleep on thetop stair and told him to lie down on the pallet bed and rest. He didnít need tobe persuaded and was soon fast asleep.             

Worse places than Defargeís wine shop could easily be found in Paris for anunsophisticated peasant like him. Except for a mysterious fear of Madame Defargethat bothered him constantly, his life was new and exciting. But Madame Defargesat at the counter all day, ignoring him and determined not to show that hisbeing had any connection to a secret plan. He trembled in his wooden shoeswhenever he looked at her and told himself that it was impossible to know whatthe lady might pretend next. He was sure that if she decided to pretend that shehad seen him kill someone and then skin the victim afterward, she would continuewith the idea until he had been convicted of murder.            

Therefore, when Sunday came, the repairer of roads was not happy, although heclaimed he was, to find out that Madame Defarge was to go with Defarge andhimself to Versailles. It was additionally worrisome to have Madame Defargeknitting the whole way there on public transportation. It was also worrisome tohave her in the crowd that afternoon still holding her knitting in her hands asthe crowd waited to see the carriage of the king and queen.             

ìYou work hard, madame,î said the man next to her in the crowd.            

ìYes,î answered Madame Defarge. ìI have a lot of work to do.î            

ìWhat do you make, madame?î            

ìMany things.î            

ìSuch as? ì            

ìSuch as shroudsa cloth that a corpse is wrapped in before burialshrouds,î answered Madame Defarge calmly.             

The man moved a little further away from her as soon as he could. The repairerof roads fanned himself with his blue cap. He felt hot and uncomfortable fromwhat she had said. If he needed the king and queen to restore him, he soon gothis cure. Soon the large-faced king and beautiful queen came by in their goldencoach. They were waited on by a group of fancily dressed ladies and lords whowere laughing. The repairer of roads looked on in awe at the men and women injewels and silks, wearing makeup on their handsome and haughty faces and dressedelegantly. He was so caught up for a moment that he yelled, ìLong live the king!Long live the queen! Long live everybody and everything!î as if he had never metthe three men named Jacques. Then they saw the gardens, the courtyards,terraces, fountains, and green hills of the court. They saw more of the king andqueen. They saw more lords and ladies. There was more cheering for all of themuntil he was so moved by it all that he started to cry. During this scene, whichlasted about three hours, there were many other people there with him who werealso cheering and crying. Through all of this, Defarge held him by the collar asif he might become so overwhelmed that he would charge at them all and rip themto pieces.             

ìBravo!î said Defarge. He gave him a fatherly pat on the back when it was allover. ìYouíre a good boy!î he said.             

The repairer of roads was now regaining his senses. He worried that he haddone something wrong by behaving the way he had, but he had not.            

ìYou are the man we want,î said Defarge in his ear. ìYou make these foolsthink that this will all go on forever. That makes them more disrespectful andwill end this all that much sooner.î            

ìHey!î yelled the repairer of roads, thinking about what he said. ìThatístrue.î            

ìThese fools know nothing. They hate your very breath and wish they could endyour life, your life or a hundred like it rather than harm one of their ownhorses or dogs. But they only know what you or people like you tell them. Keepfooling them then, a bit longer. It canít fool them too much.î            

Madame Defarge looked at him arrogantly and nodded in agreement.            

ìAs far as youíre concerned,î she said, ìyou would cheer and cry for anythingthat made an impressive show and a lot of sound. Wouldnít you?î            

ìHonestly, madame, I think so. At least for the moment.î            

ìIf you were shown a big pile of dolls and were told to pull them apart andsteal parts of them to take for yourself, you would pick out the richest andmost colorful. Wouldnít you?î            

ìHonestly, madame, yes.î            

ìYes. And if you were shown a flock of birds that couldnít fly and were toldto pluck off their feathers and take for them yourself, you would go after thebirds with the prettiest feathers, wouldnít you?î            

ìItís true, madame.î            

ìYouíve seen both dolls and birds today,î said Madame Defarge with a wave ofher hand toward where the king and queen and their attendants had been seen.ìNow go home!î            

Madame Defarge and her husband were glad to go back to their home in SaintAntoine. The man in the blue cap made his way through the darkness and the dustdown the many miles of road, slowly making his way toward the place where thedead marquisís chateau sat among the trees. The stone faces on the chateau hadlots of time now for listening to the wind rustle through the trees and thewater in the fountain. The few poor peasants who came within sight of the largestone courtyard and terrace staircase looking for herbs to eat or small bits offirewood had thought in their hungry delirium that the expressions on the faceshad changed. A faint rumor spread in the village that when the knife plungedinto the marquisís body the faces on the stone figures changed from expressionsof pride to expressions of anger and pain. Also, when the tall man was hangedforty feet above the fountain the stone faces were said to have changed again tolook like they had been avenged. They would keep these expressions forever. Inthe stone face over the large window of the bedroom where the marquis waskilled, there were two small dents in the sculptureís nose. Everybody noticedthem and no one remembered having seen them there before. A few times, two orthree ragged peasants would come out from the crowd to take a quick peek at thestone face that looked like the marquis. No one would point to it for more thana minute before everyone would run off into the trees like rabbits, though theactual rabbits were luckier as they could find enough to eat.             

The chateau and the hut, the stone face and the hanged man, the red stain onthe stone floor and the pure water in the village well, thousands of acres ofland, a whole province of France, even all of France, and everything under thenight skyóall are just a line as thin as a hair on the timeline of man. Ourwhole world and all the events that take place on it, both big and little, passin the twinkling of a star. And just as human knowledge can split a ray of lightand analyze what itís made of, so more intelligent beings might be able toanalyze all of the thoughts, deeds, vices, and virtues of every human being onearth.             

Monsieur and Madame Defarge came moving along slowly in the darkness in thepublic vehicle, to the gate of Paris, which lay in the path to theirdestination. They were stopped at the barrier guardhouse, as usual. Soldierswith lanterns came toward them to ask questions, and Monsieur Defarge got downfrom the vehicle since he knew one or two of the soldiers and one of thepolicemen. He knew the policeman well and embraced him.             

When they had reached Saint Antoine again that night, they finally got downnear the edge of the town. As they walked through the black mud and garbage inthe streets ,Madame Defarge spoke to her husband:            

ìSay then, my friend. What did Jacques the policeman tell you?î            

ìHe told me all he knows, which isnít much tonight. Thereís been another spyhired for our neighborhood. There might be many more, for all he knows, but heknows of one for sure.î            

ìOh, well!î said Madame Defarge, raising her eyebrows in a calm, businesslikemanner. ìWeíll need to put him on the list. What do they call him?î            

ìHeís English.î            

ìEven better. Whatís his name?î            

ìBarsad,î said Defarge, using the French pronunciation. But he had been socareful to get the name right that he said it perfectly.            

ìBarsad,î repeated Madame Defarge. ìGood. Whatís his first name?î            

ìJohn.î            

ìJohn Barsad,î repeated Madame Defarge after repeating it to herself. ìGood.What does he look like, does anyone know?î            

ìHeís about forty years old. Heís about five feet nine inches tall. He hasblack hair and a dark complexion. Heís generally handsome. He has dark eyes; along, thin, yellow face, and he has a hooked nose that curves toward his leftcheek, which gives him a mean look.î             

ìMy goodness. Itís a portrait!î said Madame Defarge, laughing. ìIíll put himon the list tomorrow.î            

They went into the wine shop, which was closed because it was midnight. MadameDefarge immediately took her place at her desk and counted the small amount ofmoney the shop had earned while they were gone. She inspected the stock, lookedthrough the entries in the book, made some entries herself, inspected thebartender in every way possible, and finally sent him off to bed. Then shepoured out the coins in the money bowl again and began to tie them up in ahandkerchief. She tied them up in a line of separate knots to keep them frombeing stolen during the night. All this time Defarge had his pipe in his mouthand was pacing up and down, admiring her work but staying out of her way. Thisis the way he handled all of their business and personal affairs in life.        

It was a hot night, and the shop was in a filthy area of town and smelled bad.Monsieur Defargeís sense of smell wasnít delicate at all, but the wine stockseemed to smell much stronger than it had ever tasted, as did the rum, brandy,and anisea licorice-flavored liqueuranise. He waved the combination of scents away as he finished his pipe and put itdown.             

ìYouíre tired,î said Madame Defarge, looking up as she tied the coins into thehandkerchief. ìThey are only the usual smells.î            

ìIím a little tired,î her husband admitted.            

ìYouíre a little depressed too,î said Madame Defarge, who was never so focusedon the shopís business that she didnít notice how her husband was doing. ìOh,men, men!î            

ìBut, my dear!î Defarge began.            

ìëBut, my dear!íî Madame Defarge repeated, nodding at him. ìBut, my dear! Youare depressed tonight, my dear!î            

ìWell, then,î said Defarge, as if she had wrung the thought out of him. ìIt    is a long time.î            

ìIt is a long time,î repeated his wife, ì and when isnít it a long time?Revenge takes a long time. Itís just the way it is.î            

ìIt doesnít take a long time for a man to be struck by lightning,î saidDefarge.            

ìHow long,î asked Madame Defarge calmly, ìdoes it take to make and store thelightning? Tell me.î            

Defarge looked up thoughtfully, as if there were some sense in what she hadsaid.             

ìIt doesnít take a long time,î said Madame Defarge, ìfor an earthquake todestroy a town. Well! Tell me, how long does it take to create anearthquake?î            

ìA long time, I suppose,î said Defarge.             

ìBut when it is ready, it takes place and destroys everything in its path. Inthe meantime, it is always growing, although no one sees or hears it. Takecomfort in that.î            

She tied a coin into a knot with a fierce look in her eyes, as if she werestrangling an enemy.            

ìI tell you,î said Madame Defarge, reaching out her right hand for emphasis, ìthat although it is taking a long time, it is on its way. I tell you thatrevenge never turns back and never stops. I tell you that it is always movingforward. Look around and think about the lives of all the people we know.Consider the faces, the rage and unhappiness, that the group of Jacques comescloser to addressing every hour. Can such things last? Bah! Youíre beingridiculous.î            

ìMy brave wife,î answered Defarge, standing in front of her with his head bentdown a little. His hands were clasped behind his back, like a submissive studentin front of his Sunday-school teacher, ìI donít doubt any of what you aresaying. But itís lasted a long time. Itís possibleóyou know well that it isóthatchange might not come during our lifetimes.î            

ìAnd so what?î asked Madame Defarge, tying another knot as if she werestrangling another enemy.             

ìWell!î said Defarge, with a shrug. ìWe shall not see victory.î            

ìWe will have helped to cause it,î answered Madame Defarge, waiving her handfor emphasis. ìNothing that we do is wasted. I believe with all of my soul thatwe shall see victory. But even if we donít, even if I knew that we would not,show me the neck of an aristocrat who is a tyrant and I wouldóî            

Then Madame Defarge, clenching her teeth, violently tied another knot in thehandkerchief.            

ìHold on!î yelled Defarge. He blushed a little, as if he felt she were callinghim a coward. ìI too, my dear, will stop at nothing.î            

ìYes! But it is your weakness that sometimes you need to see your victim andan opportunity in front of you to keep you going. You need to stay focusedwithout that. When the time comes, let yourself go like a tiger and a devil. Butuntil then, keep yourself in checkóalways ready to pounce, but hidden where noone can see.î            

Madame punctuated the end of this sentence by hitting the little counter withher chain of money as if she were beating the counterís brains out. Then shegathered the heavy handkerchief under her arm calmly and told him that it wastime to go to bed.             

At noon the next day, Madame Defarge was at her usual place in the wine shop,knitting busily. There was a rose beside her, and she glanced at it now andthen, but with her usual preoccupied appearance. There were a few customersthere. Some were drinking and some were not. Some were standing and some weresitting or hanging around. It was a very hot day, and lots of flies wereinvestigating the sticky little wine glasses near Madame Defarge and droppingdead at the bottoms. The other flies werenít bothered by seeing the dead flies.They looked at them indifferently, as if they themselves were elephants orsomething else completely unrelated to them, until they too ended up dead. Itísstrange to think how oblivious flies are! Perhaps the lords and ladies at theroyal court were thinking just as much that sunny summer day.             

A person coming in through the door of the wine shop cast his shadow on MadameDefarge, and Madame Defarge felt it was someone she didnít know. She put downher knitting and started to pin her rose to her hat before she looked at thestranger.             

It was strange. The moment Madame Defarge picked up the rose, all of thecustomers stopped talking and gradually left the wine shop.             

ìGood day, madame,î said the newcomer.            

ìGood day, monsieur,î answered Madame Defarge.            

She said the last words out loud, and to herself she added, ìHa! Good day toyou, about forty years old, about five feet nine inches tall with black hair, ahandsome appearance, a dark complexion, dark eyes, and long, thin, yellow facewith a hooked nose that leans toward the left cheek, giving you a mean look!Good day!î            

ìWould you be kind enough to give me a little glass of aged cognac and a drinkof cool, fresh water, madame?î            

Madame Defarge politely gave him what he asked.             

ìThis cognac is marvelous, madame!î            

It was the first time anyone had complimented her cognac, and she knew enoughabout where it came from to know it was not good cognac. She said, however, thatthe cognac was flattered by his comment and she resumed her knitting. Thevisitor watched her fingers for a few moments and then looked around the wineshop.             

ìYouíre very good at knitting, madame.î            

ìI am used to it.î            

ìItís a very pretty pattern too.î            

ìYou think so?î she said, smiling at him.             

ìDefinitely. Can I ask what itís for?î            

ìItís just a hobby,î said Madame Defarge, still smiling at him while herfingers worked quickly.             

ìItís not for a particular use?î            

ìThat depends. I may find a use for it someday. If I do, wellÖ,î said MadameDefarge. She took a breath and nodded in almost a flirtatious way, ìthen Iílluse it.î            

It was amazing that the people of Saint Antoine seemed to hate the rose onMadame Defargeís headband. Two men had come into the wine shop separately andhad been about to order a drink. When they saw the rose they stuttered andpretended they were looking for a friend who wasnít there, then they left. Ofall the people who had been there when the visitor had come in, not one of themwas still there. They had all gone. The spy had been watching but hadnít noticedthe sign. They had all wandered off in a poor, casual way that looked perfectlynormal and innocent.             

ìJohn,î Madame Defarge thought as she knit the name into herlist and kept looking at the stranger. ìIf you stay long enough I will have knit    ëBarsadí before youíve left.î            

ìDo you have a husband, madame?î            

ìI do.î            

ìChildren?î            

ìNo children.î            

ìBusiness seems bad.î            

ìBusiness is very bad. All the people are poor.î            

ìAh, those poor, unlucky people! So oppressed too, like you say.î            

ìAs you say,î Madame Defarge said, correcting him. Sheskillfully knit something extra into his name that promised him nothing good.        

ìExcuse me. Of course it was I who said so, but of course you think sotoo.î            

ìI think so?î answered Madame Defarge in a high voice. ìMyhusband and I are busy enough keeping this wine shop open. We donít have time tothink. All we think about here is how to survive. That is the subject    we think about, and it gives us enough to think about frommorning to night, without worrying about other people. I? Thinkfor other people? No, no.î            

The spy was there to find any little bits of information he could. He didnítallow his confusion to show on his face. Instead he stood there looking like hejust wanted to gossip casually. He leaned his elbow on Madame Defargeís littlecounter, occasionally sipping his cognac.             

ìGaspardís execution is a shame, madame. Ah! Poor Gaspard!î he sighedsympathetically.            

ìMy faith!î answered Madame Defarge, casually. ìIf people stab other peoplewith knives, they need to pay for it. He knew beforehand what the punishmentwould be. He has paid the price for his crime.î            

ìI believe,î whispered the spy, looking conspiratorial, ìI believe there is alot of sympathy and anger for the poor man in this neighborhood, isnít there?Between you and me?î            

ìIs there?î asked Madame Defarge innocently.            

ìIsnít there?î            

ìHere is my husband!î said Madame Defarge.             

As Monsieur Defarge came through the door of the wine shop, the spy salutedhim by touching his hat and said with a smile, ìGood day, Jacques!î Defargestopped walking and stared at him.             

ìGood day, Jacques!î repeated the spy. He didnít speak quite as confidently orsmile quite as easily this time.             

ìYou are confused, monsieur,î answered the owner of the wine shop. ìYou musthave confused me for someone else. Thatís not my name. I am ErnestDefarge.î            

ìWhatever,î said the spy lightheartedly, but a bit uneasily too. ìGoodday!î            

ìGood day!î answered Defarge, coldly.            

ìI was telling your wife, whom I had the pleasure of chatting with when youentered, that I hear there is a lot of sympathy and anger in Saint Antoine aboutthe execution of poor Gaspard.î            

ìNo one has told me that,î said Defarge, shaking his head. ìI know nothingabout it.î            

After he said this he walked behind the little counter and stood with his handon the back of his wifeís chair. He looked over his wife at the spy, whom eitherof them would have shot him with the greatest satisfaction.             

The spy, accustomed to his job, didnít change his casual attitude. He finishedhis little glass of cognac and took a sip of water. He asked for another glassof cognac, and Madame Defarge poured it for him and went back to her knitting.She hummed a little song while she knit.             

ìYou seem to know this quarter well. I mean, even better than I do,î observedDefarge.             

ìNot at all, but I hope to get to know it better. I am extremely interested inthe unfortunate people who live here.î            

ìHah!î Defarge muttered.             

ìThe joy of talking with you, Monsieur Defarge, reminds me,î continued thespy, ìthat I am lucky enough to know some things about you.î            

ìReally!î said Defarge, indifferently.            

ìYes, really. I know that when Dr. Manette was released from prison, you, hisold servant, took care of him. He was brought to you. You see that I know aboutthe situation?î            

ìThatís true, for sure,î said Defarge. His wife let him know by brushing herelbow against him as she knitted and sang that he should answer, but only asbriefly as possible.             

ìHis daughter came to you,î said the spy. ìAnd she took Dr. Manette from you,along with a well-dressed man in brown. What is his name? He had a little wig.Lorry! From Tellson and Company over in England.î            

ìThatís true,î repeated Defarge.             

ìVery interesting memories!î said the spy. ìI have known Dr. Manette and hisdaughter in England.î            

ìYes?î said Defarge.             

ìYou donít hear from them much now?î asked the spy.             

ìNo,î said Defarge.             

ìActually,î Madame Defarge added, looking up from her knitting and her littlesong, ìwe never hear from them. We got the news that they arrived safely inEngland, and perhaps another letter or two from them, maybe two. But since then,they have gone their way, we have gone ours, and we havenít kept intouch.î            

ìGood, madame,î answered the spy. ìShe is going to be married.î            

ìGoing to be?î repeated Madame Defarge. ìShe was attractive enough to havegotten married a long time ago. You English are cold people, it seems tome.î            

ìOh! You can tell that I am English.î            

ìYou have an English accent,î answered Madame Defarge. ìTherefore I assumethat you are an Englishman.î            

He didnít take this as a compliment, but he made the best of it and laughed itoff. After finishing his cognac, he added:            

ìYes, Miss Manette is going to be married. But not to an Englishman. Sheísmarrying someone who, like herself, is French. And speaking of poor Gaspard, itis strange that she is going to marry the nephew of the marquis, who Gaspard washanged for killing. In other words, she is marrying the new marquis. But helives in England where no one knows who he is. He isnít a marquis there. Therehe is known as Mr. Charles Darnay. DíAulnais is the name of his motherís side ofthe family.î            

Madame Defarge kept knitting, but her husband was obviously affected by thenews. He struck a match and lit his pipe behind the counter, but he couldníthide the fact that he was troubled by the news. His hand was shaking. The manwould have been a terrible spy if he hadnít noticed it or made of note of it tohimself.             

No other customers were coming in that Mr. Barsad could get information from.So having seen at least this one suspicious sign, whatever it might end up beingworth to him, he paid for his drinks and left. Before he went he said in afriendly way that he looked forward to seeing Monsieur and Madame Defarge again.For several minutes after he had gone out into the streets of Saint Antoine, thehusband and wife stayed exactly the way they had been in case him came backin.            

ìCan what he said about Mademoiselle Manette be true?î asked Defarge quietly.He looked down at his wife, smoking his pipe with one hand and putting the otheron the back of her chair.             

ìSince heís the one who said it, itís probably false,î answered MadameDefarge, raising her eyebrows a little. ìBut it might be true.î            

ìIf it isóî Defarge started to say, then stopped.             

ìIf it is?î repeated his wife.            

ìóAnd if the revolution comes while we are still alive, I hope for her sakethat destiny keeps her husband out of France.î            

ìHer husbandís destiny,î said Madame Defarge, as calmly as usual, ìwill takehim where he is meant to go and to the end that he is meant for. Thatís all Iknow.î            

ìBut itís very strange, isnít it?î said Defarge. He was almost begging hiswife to admit it. ìAfter all weíve done for her father and herself, that herhusbandís name should be on the list you are knitting, next to that spy who justleft us.î            

ìStranger things than this will happen when the revolution does come,îanswered Madame Defarge. ìI have them both here on my list, for sure. And theyare both here for what they have done. That is enough.î            

She rolled up her knitting when she said this, then took the rose out of thehandkerchief that was wrapped around her head. Either the people of SaintAntoine knew instinctively that she had taken out the rose or the people ofSaint Antoine were watching for it to be removed. Either way, people soon camewandering into the wine shop and things in the wine shop went back to normal.        

In the evening, when the residents of Saint Antoine come outside, people saton doorsteps and window ledges. They stood on the corners of dirty streets andcourtyards for a breath of fresh air. Madame Defarge, with her knitting in herhand, would go from place to place and from one group of people to the other.She was like a missionarya member of a religion who tries to convert other peoplemissionary, and there were many others like herótypes that the world willbe lucky never to have again. All the women knitted. They knitted worthlessthings, but it was busywork to take their minds off eating and drinking. Theykept their hands busy instead of their jaws and their stomachs. If they hadnítkept their fingers busy with knitting they would have been that much more awareof how hungry they were.             

But as they worked their fingers, their eyes and minds worked hard. And asMadame Defarge moved from group to group, her fingers, eyes, and thoughts gotquicker and angrier with every group of women she stopped by to visit with.        

Monsieur Defarge stood smoking in his doorway. He watched her admiringly.ìSheís a great woman,î he said. ìA strong, magnificent woman!î            

Night came. The church bells rang, and the beating of soldierís drums in thePalace Courtyard could be heard. The women sat knitting in the darkness. Anotherdarkness was closing in for sure when the church bells, which were ringingpleasantly in the tall church steeples all over France, would be melted down tomake cannons. When the military drums would be beating to drown out the voice ofthe peasants, which that night was as strong as the voices of Power, Plenty,Freedom, and Life. Darkness was closing in around the women who sat thereknitting. Soon there would be a structure built in that same spot, where thesewomen would one day sit knitting and counting the number of heads that were tobe chopped off.            

There was never a more glorious sunset on the quiet street corner in Soho thanone night when Doctor Manette and Lucie sat under the plane tree together. Themoon never rose with a gentler glow over London than on that night when it roseas they were still sitting under the tree, and shined through its leaves ontotheir faces.             

Lucie was to be married the next day. She had saved this last night for herfather, and they sat alone together under the plane tree.            

ìAre you happy, father?î            

ìVery happy, my child.î            

They hadnít said much, though they had been there a long time. When it wasstill light enough to work and read, she hadnít done her work or read to him asshe usually did. Many times she had done both as she sat beside him under thetree. But tonight was different than all others, and nothing could change that.        

ìIím very happy tonight, too, father. The love that Heaven has blessed mewithómy love for Charles, and Charlesís love for meó has made me very happy.But, if my life wasnít still dedicated to you, or if my marriage pulled usapart, even by the distance of only a few streets, I would be more unhappy anddisappointed in myself than I could tell you. Even as it isóî            

Her voice quivered.            

She embraced him in the moonlight and buried her face in his chest. Themoonlight is always sad, as is sunlight and human life itself, when it is comingor going.            

ìDear father! Can you tell me one last time that you are absolutely sure thatno new feelings of mine, or responsibilities, will ever come between us? I amsure of it, but are you? Do you feel sure about it in your heart?î            

Her father answered with a cheer and certainty he couldnít have faked, ìQuitesure, my darling! More sure than that!î he added, kissing her tenderly. ìMyfuture is much brighter, Lucie, now that you are getting married, than it couldhave been without it, or than it ever was before.î            

ìI hope that is true, father.î            

ìBelieve it, my love! It is true. Think of how natural and easy it is, mydear, for it to be that way. You, loyal and young, cannot understand how worriedI have been that your life would be wastedó î            

She raised her hand to his lips to stop him from speaking, but he took hold ofit and repeated the word.            

ìówasted, my child. That it should not be wasted. That you would abandon thenatural course of your life to take care of me. You are so unselfish that youcanít grasp how much I have worried about this. But, only ask yourself, howcould I be completely happy if you were not?î            

ìIf I had never met Charles, father, I would have been happy being withyou.î            

He smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappywithout Charles once she had seen him. He answered:            

ìYou did see him, my child. Charles is the man you love. If it hadnít beenCharles, it would have been someone else. Or, if it hadnít been someone else, itwould have been my fault. Then my unhappy past would have spread beyond myselfand would have made you unhappy too.î            

It was the first time since the trial that she had ever heard him mention hisunhappy past. His words made her feel strange in a way she had never feltbefore. She remembered the feeling for a long time afterwards.             

ìSee!î said Doctor Manette, raising his hand toward the moon. ìI have lookedat the moon from my prison window when it was painful to look at. I have lookedat it when it was such torture to think of the moon shining on all that I hadlost that I beat my head against my cell walls. I have looked at the moon when Iwas so tired and depressed that I thought about nothing accept how many lines Icould draw up and down and across it.î He added to himself as he looked at themoon, ìit was twenty either direction, I remember, and it was difficult tosqueeze the twentieth line in.î            

The strange feeling she had got stronger as he talked about that time. But hewasnít telling her in order to shock her. He only seemed to be comparing howhappy he was now to the difficult times he had faced before.             

ìI have looked at the moon, speculating thousands of times about the unbornchild I was taken from. Wondering if it were alive. Wondering if it had beenborn alive, or if the poor motherís shock had killed it. Wondering if it was aboy that would someday avenge his fatherís imprisonment. There was a time when Iwas in prison when I wanted revenge so badly I could hardly stand it. Wonderingif it was a boy who would never know what had happened to his father, or whomight even think that his father had left on his own. Wondering if it was adaughter who would grow up to be a woman.î            

She pulled closer to him and kissed him on the cheek and hand.             

ìI have pictured my daughter as having forgotten about me. That is, notknowing anything about me. I have thought about how old she was year after year.I pictured her marrying a man who knew nothing about what had happened to me. Iimagined I had been forgotten by everyone alive and that the next generationwould know nothing about me.î            

ìFather! Even to hear that you thought such things about a daughter who neverexisted hurts me as if I had been the daughter you speak of.î            

ìYou, Lucie? It is because of the comfort and strength that you have broughtme that we can talk about these memories now under the moonlight on our lastnight together. What did I say just now?î            

ìThe daughter you had imagined didnít know anything about you and didnít careabout you.î            

ìSo! But on other moonlit nights, when I have been in a different mood, onelike a sad sense of peace, I have imagined that she came to visit me in my celland took me out of the prison and to freedom. I often imagined her standing inthe moonlight as I see you doing now. Except that I never got to hold her in myarms. The image was between my little grated window and the door. But youunderstand that that is not the child I am talking about.î            

ìThe figure was not in your imagination?î            

ìNo. That was another thing. It stood before my eyes but it never moved. Thephantom that I was dreaming about was another real child. I donít know anythingabout what she looked like other than that she looked like her mother. The otherchild looked like her tooó like you doóbut not the same. Do you understand whatIím saying, Lucie? Hardly, I think. Youíd probably have to be a lonely prisonerto understand the confusing differences between imagination and reality.î        

Even though he was calm she was troubled as he tried to describe what it hadbeen like for him.             

ìWhen I was in that more peaceful state of mind, I would imagine her coming tome in the moonlight and taking me out to show me the home where she lived withher husband. It was full of memories of her lost father. She had a picture of mein her room and prayed for me. She led a happy, productive life, but my sadstory was still a part of it.            

ìI was that child, father. I wasnít half as good a daughter as that, but Iloved you just as much.î            

ìShe showed me her children too,î said Doctor Manette. ìThey had heard of meand been told my sad story. When they went by a prison they stayed far away fromits walls and looked up at the barred windows and spoke in whispers. Shecouldnít free me. I imagined that she always brought me back to the prison aftershowing me these things. But then, after the relief of crying, I would fall tomy knees and bless her.î            

ìI hope that I am that child, father. O my dear father, will you bless me aseagerly tomorrow.î             

ìLucie, the reason I remember these troubled times is the same reason I loveyou tonight more than words can say. I thank God for how happy I am. Mythoughts, when they were the most disturbed, never reached the happiness that Ihave had with you and that we have still ahead.î            

He hugged her, asked that Heaven watch over her, and thanked Heaven for givingher to him. Then they went into the house.             

No one was invited to the wedding except for Mr. Lorry. The only bridesmaidwas Miss Pross. The married couple wouldnít move to another house. They wouldtake the upper rooms that had previously belonged to the lodger that they neversaw, and they wanted nothing more.             

Doctor Manette was very happy at their little supper. There were only three ofthem at the table. Miss Pross was the third. He wished that Charles had beenthere, and he was nearly ready to object to the romantic little plan that keptCharles away. He toasted to him warmly.             

The time came when he had to say goodnight to Lucie and they parted ways. Butat three in the morning Lucie came downstairs again and snuck into his room,bothered by fears and worries.             

Everything was in order, though. It was quiet, and he was sleeping. His whitehair looked pretty on his pillow, and his hands rested quietly on the blanket.She put her candle in the shadows far away and snuck up close to his bed. Shekissed him, then leaned over and looked at him.             

Being a prisoner had left its marks on his handsome face. But he worked sohard to cover up the marks that he hid them even when he was asleep. A moreremarkable face than his could not be found that night, as he quietly anddeterminedly struggled with his demons.            

She timidly put her hand on his chest and prayed that she could be as devotedto him as she hoped to be, and as his terrible past deserved. Then she removedher hand, kissed him again, and left. The sun rose and the shadows of the leavesof the plane tree moved on his face as softly as her lips had moved when she hadprayed for him.             

The sun was shining brightly on the day of Charles and Lucieís wedding, andthe wedding party was ready outside of Dr. Manetteís room. The door was closedand the doctor was speaking with Charles Darnay. The beautiful Miss Manette, Mr.Lorry, and Miss Pross were all ready to go to the church. Miss Pross hadgradually come to accept the fact that Miss Manette would get married sooner orlater. She would have been completely overjoyed by the wedding except for thefact that she still believed her brother, Solomon, should have been thegroom.            

ìAnd so,î said Mr. Lorry, who could not admire the bride enough and who hadbeen moving around her to see every part of her simple, pretty wedding gown.ìThis is why I brought you across the English Channel when you were young, mysweet Lucie! Lord bless me! I thought I was doing such a small thing. I didnítrealize how important it would one day be for my friend Mr. Charles!î            

ìYou didnít mean for them to get married,î commented the straightforward MissPross, ìand therefore how could you have known that this would happen? Thatísnonsense.î            

ìReally? All right. But donít cry,î said the gentle Mr. Lorry.            

ìIím not crying. Youíre crying,î said Miss Pross.            

ìI, my dear Miss Pross?î By now, Mr. Lorry dared to be nice to hersometimes.            

ìYou were crying just now. I saw you, and Iím not surprised about it. Yourgift of plates and silverware is so impressive that it would make anybody cry.Thereís not a fork or a spoon in the whole collection that didnít make me cryuntil I couldnít see through my tears when the box arrived last night,î saidMiss Pross.             

ìThank you very much,î said Mr. Lorry. ìThough I hadnít intended for my meagergift to make anyone cry so much. Dear me! This is an occasion that makes a manreflect on all the things he has lost in his life. Dear, dear, dear! To thinkthat I might have gotten married myself sometime in these last fiftyyears.î            

ìNot at all!î said Miss Pross.            

ìYou think itís not possible that there could have been a Mrs. Lorry?î askedMr. Lorry.            

ìPooh!î answered Miss Pross. ìYou were born to be a bachelor.î            

ìWell!î said Mr. Lorry, adjusting his little wig happily. ìThat seems likely,too.î            

ìAnd you were made to be a bachelor before you were put into your cradle,îcontinued Miss Pross.            

ìThen I think that I had bad luck,î said Mr. Lorry. ìI should have had somechoice as to whether I would get married. Enough of this! Now, my dear Lucie,îhe said, putting his arm around her waist, ìI hear them in the next room. MissPross and I, as two formal businesspeople, donít want to miss our last chance tosay something reassuring to you. You are leaving your father in hands as honestand loving as your own. He will be taken care of in every possible way. Duringthe next two weeks, while you are in Warwickshire and the surrounding area onyour honeymoon, Iíll even set aside my obligations to Tellsonís Bankóto someextentóin order to look after your father. And, after two weeks, when he comesto join you and your husband on your other two-week trip to Wales, you will seethat we kept him in the healthiest and happiest condition. Now, I hear yourhusband coming to the door. Let me kiss you and give you an old-fashionedbachelorís blessing, before your husband comes to take you for his own.î             

He held her beautiful face in his hands for a moment and looked at theexpression on her forehead that he remembered so well. Then he touched her headwith his tenderly, her blond hair pressing against his little brown wig. Thegesture was old-fashioned enough to have been around since the days of Adam andEve.             

The door of Dr. Manetteís room opened and the doctor came out with CharlesDarnay. Dr. Manette hadnít looked pale at all when they went into the roomtogether, but now he looked so deathly pale that there was no trace of color inhis face. He kept his composure, though. Only the shrewd Mr. Lorry noticed thathe seemed a little like the way he had been after his release from prison.        

The doctor offered his arm to Lucie, and he took her downstairs to the chariotthat Mr. Lorry had hired for the occasion. The rest of them followed in anothercarriage, and soon Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily marriedprivately in a nearby church.            

Everyone in the little group that watched them get married was smiling and hadtears in their eyes. Lucie had some diamonds on her hand that Mr. Lorry hadgiven to her out of one of his pockets. They all went home for breakfast, andall of it went well. Soon Miss Manette and her father, who had first embraced inthe attic in Paris, were embracing again in the morning sunlight. They stoodtogether in the doorway and said goodbye.             

It was hard for them to say goodbye, though it didnít last long. Her fathercheered for her, and gently pulling himself away from her embrace, finally said,ìTake her, Charles! She is yours!î             

She waved to them emotionally from a window of the chaise as she and herhusband drove off. Then she was gone.             

The street corner was off the main street and the wedding festivities had beenvery small and simple. The doctor, Mr. Lorry, and Miss Pross were now left allalone. When they went back inside in the welcome shade of the hall of thedoctorís house, Mr. Lorry noticed that something had changed about the doctor.It was as if he had been struck by the golden arm of the goldsmith next door. Helooked sick.            

He had kept many of his feelings to himself, of course, and some strongemotions might have been expected to come out of him once the bride and groomhad left. But what worried Mr. Lorry was the frightened look on the doctorísface, and the fact that the doctor had absent-mindedly grabbed his head in hishands and wandered off into his room when they got upstairs. It reminded Mr.Lorry of Defarge, the owner of the wine shop, and their night ride away fromParis under the stars.             

ìI think it would be best if we didnít talk to him right now or disturb him atall,î he whispered to Miss Pross. ìI need to go to Tellsonís Bank. Iíll go therenow and come back very soon, and then we will take him on a ride into thecountry and eat dinner there. Everything will be fine.î            

It was easier for Mr. Lorry to stop in at Tellsonís than it was for him toleave Tellsonís. He was delayed there for two hours. When he came back, heclimbed the old staircase alone without bothering the servant. On his way intothe doctorís rooms, he heard the sound of quiet knocking.            

ìGood God!î he said, startled. ìWhatís that?î            

Miss Pross was there, looking terrified. ìOh me! Oh me! All is lost!î shecried, wringing her hands. ìWhat will we tell Lucie? He doesnít recognize me.And heís making shoes!î            

Mr. Lorry tried his best to calm her down and went into the doctorís room. Thebench had been turned toward the light, as it had been when Mr. Lorry had seenhim making shoes in the attic in Paris. His head was bent over, and he was verybusy.             

ìDr. Manette. My dear friend, Dr. Manette!î            

The doctor looked at him for a moment, half questioningly and half as if hewere angry that someone spoke to him. Then he bent over his work again.            

He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat. His shirt collar was open the way itused to be when he had been making shoes before. Even his face looked old andworn out like it had before, and he worked hard and impatiently as if he hadbeen interrupted.            

Mr. Lorry looked at what he was working onóa shoe of the old size and shape.He picked up another shoe that was lying near him and asked what it was.             

ìItís a young ladyís walking shoe,î he mumbled without looking up at him. ìIshould have finished it a long time ago. Leave it alone.î            

ìBut, Dr. Manette! Look at me!î            

The doctor looked up at him in his old mechanical and submissive mannerwithout stopping his work.            

ìDo you know who I am, my dear friend? Think again. You are not a shoemaker.Think, my dear friend!î            

Mr. Lorry couldnít make the doctor say anything more. The doctor would look upfor a moment when he was asked to, but he wouldnít say a word. He worked andworked in silence, and he didnít seem to hear or respond to anything. The onlysign of hope Mr. Lorry noticed was that sometimes he looked up without beingasked to. When this happened there seemed to be a faint expression of curiosityand confusion on his face, as if he were trying to make sense of something inhis mind.             

Mr. Lorry immediately realized two very important things. The first was thatthey had to keep this a secret from Lucie. The second was that it had to be keptsecret from everyone else who knew him. Together with Miss Pross they wouldstart to tell people that the doctor was ill and needed a few days of rest. Tokeep the secret from Lucie, Miss Pross would write to her. She would say thatthe doctor had gone away on a professional matter and that she had received aletter from him of some two or three hurried lines that the doctor had writtenand mailed to her by the same post.             

Mr. Lorry took these steps hoping that the doctor would get better again. Ifhe recovered soon, Mr. Lorry had a plan. There was someone who Mr. Lorry thoughtwould understand the doctorís case the best, and Mr. Lorry would ask for thispersonís opinion on the matter.             

Hoping that the doctor would recover so that he could put this third plan intoaction, Mr. Lorry decided to watch him closely but to do it as subtly aspossible. He took time off from Tellsonís Bank for the first time in his lifeand positioned himself in the window in the doctorís room.             

Mr. Lorry soon discovered that it was useless to speak to him since it madehim nervous. Mr. Lorry gave up on that idea on the first day and decided insteadto stay near him at all times and hope that his quiet presence would stop thedoctorís delusions, or at least keep them from getting worse. Mr. Lorry stayedat his seat near the window reading and writing and showing in as many pleasantways as possible that it was a place where they were both free to do whateverthey wanted.            

Dr. Manette ate and drank what they gave him and kept working. That first dayhe worked until it was too dark to see. He worked for half an hour after Mr.Lorry couldnít have seen enough to read or write if his life depended on it.When finally Dr. Manette put aside his tools until the next morning, Mr. Lorrygot up and asked him:            

ìWill you go out?î            

The doctor looked down at the floor on either side of him like he and thenlooked up at him, the way he used to in the attic in Paris. He repeatedquietly:            

ìOut?î             

ìYes. Will you go for a walk with me? Why not?î            

The doctor didnít try to answer him and didnít say another word. But as Dr.Manette leaned forward on his bench in the twilight, with his elbows on hisknees and his head in his hands, Mr. Lorry thought he saw that he was in someway asking himself, ìWhy not?î Mr. Lorry, as a shrewd businessman, saw anadvantage here and decided to follow up on it.             

Miss Pross and Mr. Lorry took turns watching him at night from the next room.The doctor paced up and down for a long time before going to bed, but when hefinally lied down, he fell asleep. He got up early in the morning and wentstraight to his bench to work.             

The next day, Mr. Lorry called him by his name cheerfully. He spoke to himabout topics that they had discussed recently. The doctor didnít answer, but itwas clear that he heard what was said and that he thought about it, even thoughhe was confused. This encouraged Mr. Lorry to have Miss Pross come in with herwork several times a day. At those times they spoke quietly of Lucie and of herfather, who was there, as if everything were normal. This was done simply andonly for short periods of time. Mr. Lorry was glad that he was looking up atthem more often and that he seemed to notice some of the inconsistencies aroundhim.             

When it was night again, Mr. Lorry asked him again as he had donebefore:            

ìDear Doctor, will you go out?î            

Like before, the doctor repeated, ìOut?î            

ìYes, for a walk with me. Why not?î            

This time, Mr. Lorry pretended to go out when he couldnít get an answer fromhim. He stayed away for an hour and then came back. In the meantime, the doctorhad moved to the window seat and had sat there looking down at the plane tree.When Mr. Lorry came back, though, the doctor moved back to his bench.             

The time went by slowly, and Mr. Lorry started to worry again. He worried moreand more day after day. The third day came and went, then the fourth and fifth.Five, six, seven, eight, and nine days went by.             

Mr. Lorry grew more and more anxious as the time passed. They kept the secretwell. Lucie knew nothing about it and was happy. But Mr. Lorry could tell thatthe doctor, who had been a little out of practice at first, was getting betterand better at making shoes and that he had never been so focused on his work.His hands had never been so quick and skilled as they were at dusk on the ninthnight.             

Mr. Lorry was so tired out by anxiously watching the doctor that he fellasleep. On the tenth morning of the doctorís illness, Mr. Lorry was startled bythe sun shining into the room, since he had dozed off when it was darknight.            

He rubbed his eyes and got up, but once he was up, he thought he might stillbe asleep. Looking into the doctorís room, he saw that the shoemakerís bench andtools had been set aside again. The doctor was sitting by the window reading,and he was in his usual morning clothes. Mr. Lorry could see his face clearly.He was still very pale, but he looked calm and focused.            

Even when he was sure that he was actually awake, Mr. Lorry wondered for a fewmoments whether the doctorís recent shoemaking had all been a dream. He couldsee his friend in front of him dressed and looking as usual, and reading as henormally did. Was there any sign that the change in the doctor that he had seenduring the past few days had actually happened?            

He only asked himself this in his first moment of confusion and surprise. Theanswer was obvious: if the doctor hadnít really relapsed into making shoes, thenhow had he, Jarvis Lorry, come to be there? How had he fallen asleep in hisclothes on the sofa in Dr. Manetteís consulting room, and how was he therehaving these thoughts outside the doctorís bedroom early that morning?            

Miss Pross was there within a few minutes, whispering quietly beside Mr.Lorry. If he had any doubts left, the way she spoke about the situation wouldhave decided the matter. By then, though, he was clearheaded and had no doubts.He decided that they should leave the doctor alone until the usual breakfasttime, then they would meet the doctor as if nothing unusual had happened. If heseemed to be behaving as he typically did, Mr. Lorry would then cautiously startlooking for help from the man whose opinion he so anxiously wanted tohear.            

Miss Pross followed his advice and they worked out the plan carefully. Mr.Lorry had plenty of time for his usual toilettethe process of attending to your personal appearancetoilette, and he arrived at breakfast in hisusual white linen with his usual tight stockings. The doctor was called asusual, and he came to breakfast.             

Mr. Lorry delicately asked the doctor some questions. Apparently, the doctorfirst thought that his daughterís marriage had taken place only the day before.Mr. Lorry mentioned briefly what day of the week and month it was. This got thedoctor to thinking and counting the days. This apparently made him uneasy. Inall other ways, however, he behaved so much like his usual self that Mr. Lorrydecided to get the help he wanted. He wanted help from Dr. Manette himself.        

When they had finished breakfast and the table had been cleared, he and thedoctor were left together. Mr. Lorry said to him emotionally:            

ìMy dear Dr. Manette, I want to get your opinion on something in secret. Thereis a very strange case that I am very interested in. That is, it is strange to    me. Perhaps since you are more knowledgeable it will beless strange to you.î            

The doctor looked at his hands, which were discolored from his recentshoemaking. He looked troubled and listened carefully. He had already looked athis hands more than once.             

ìDr. Manette,î said Mr. Lorry, touching him affectionately on the arm. ìThecase is an especially close friend of mine. Please give it some thought. For hissake, and especially for his daughterís sake, tell me what I can do for him, mydear Dr. Manette.î            

ìIf I understand correctly,î said the doctor quietly, ìitís about some mentalshockó?î            

ìYes.î            

ìBe specific,î said the doctor. ìGive me all the details.î            

Mr. Lorry saw that the doctor understood him, and he went on.            

ìMy dear Dr. Manette, this person has had a shock that started long ago andhas continued for some time. It is very severe and has greatly affected hisemotions and, as you said, his mind. His mind. This person has suffered fromthis shock for a long time. No one can say how long exactly, because the personhimself doesnít know how long itís been, and there are no other ways of findingout. This person has recovered, but he canít remember how. I once heard him saythis publicly in a memorable way. He has recovered so completely from the shockthat he is capable of difficult work with the mind and body. He is constantlyadding to his stock of knowledge, which was already large to begin with. Butunfortunately there has beenóî he paused and took a deep breath ìóa slightrelapse.î            

The doctor asked in a low voice, ìFor how long?î            

ìNine days and nights.î            

ìWhat was the relapse like?î The doctor looked at his hands again. ìIímguessing he started some old activity that was connected with the shock?î            

ìYes, thatís correct.î             

ìNow, did you ever see him doing that activity when he used to do it before?îasked the doctor, carefully,             

ìOnce.î            

ìAnd when he relapsed, was he in most ways, or in all ways, as he wasthen?î            

ìI think he was exactly the same.î            

ìYou spoke about his daughter. Does his daughter know about hisrelapse?î            

ìNo. She has not been told, and I hope she will never be told. Only myself andone other trustworthy person know about it.î            

The doctor took Mr. Lorryís hand and said quietly, ìThat was very kind andthoughtful of you.î Mr. Lorry took his hand in return, and neither of them spokefor a little while.             

ìNow, my dear Dr. Manette,î said Mr. Lorry after a little while and in hismost compassionate way. ìI am just a businessman. I am not fit to deal with suchcomplicated matters. I donít have the necessary information or intelligence, andI need help. There is no man in the world that I could rely on for help morethan you. Tell me, how does this relapse happen? Is it possible there will beanother? Is there a way to stop it from happening again? If it does happenagain, what should we do? How does it happen at all? What can I do to help myfriend? There is no man that could want to help his friend more than I want tohelp mine, if I only knew how.î            

ìBut I donít know how to begin in such a case,î continued Mr. Lorry. ìIf yourwisdom, knowledge, and experience could put me on the right track, I might beable to do a lot. But uninformed and without help, I canít do much of anything.Please talk with me about it. Please help me understand it better and teach mehow to be of more help.î            

Dr. Manette sat thinking over these sincere words, and Mr. Lorry did notpressure him.            

ìI think itís likely that the patient may have expected the relapse you havedescribed,î said the doctor, requiring an effort to break the silence.            

ìWas he afraid it might happen again?î Mr. Lorry asked.            

ìVery much.î He said it with an involuntary shudder.            

ìYou have no idea how troublesome such a fear is to a person, and howdifficultóhow almost impossibleóit is for him to make himself talk about thesubject that haunts him.î            

ìWould it help him,î asked Mr. Lorry, ìif he could tell someone else thatsecret when it is bothering him?î            

ìI think so. But it is, as I have told you, almost impossible. I even thinkthat, in some cases, it is impossible.î             

ìNow,î said Mr. Lorry, gently laying his hand on the doctorís arm again. Aftera short silence he said, ìWhy do you think this attack happened?î            

ìI believe,î answered Dr. Manette, ìthat something caused him to startthinking about the things that first caused the sickness. He recalled somestrong, intense memories. Itís likely that, for a long time, there had been adread in the back of his mind that those memories might come back to him, undercertain circumstances, for instance, or on a particular occasion. He tried toprepare himself for it, but it was no use. Itís possible that trying to preparehimself for it made it worse.î            

ìWould he remember what happened during the relapse?î asked Mr. Lorryhesitantly.            

The doctor looked around the room sadly, shook his head, and answered quietly,ìNot at all.î            

ìWhat do we do in the future?î asked Mr. Lorry.            

ìNow,î said the doctor, recovering himself, ìI have great hope. It gives mehope that he recovered from his relapse so soon. The fact that he gave in to thepressure of whatever was haunting him and recovered after the spell had passedgives me hope that the worst is over.î            

ìWell, well! That makes me feel better. I am thankful!î said Mr. Lorry.            

ìI am also thankful!î repeated the doctor, bowing his head withrespect.            

ìThere are two other things that I would like help with,î said Mr. Lorry. ìMayI go on?î            

ìYou couldnít do your friend a better favor than to continue.î The doctor gavehim his hand.             

ìFirst of all, the patient studies a lot and is unusually energetic. He worksvery hard at acquiring professional knowledge, at conducting experiments, and atdoing many other things. Now, does he work too hard?î            

ìI donít think so. It may just be the way he is. His mind might always need tobe occupied. That might partly be in his nature and partly a result of thesickness. The less his mind is occupied with healthy things, the more it wouldbe in danger of focusing on unhealthy things. He may have noticed this abouthimself.î             

ìYouíre sure that he is not under too much stress?î            

ìI think I am quite sure of it.î            

ìMy dear Manette, if he were overworked nowóî            

ìMy dear Lorry, I doubt that that would happen easily. He has experiencedextreme stress in one direction. He needs the opposite to balance himselfout.î            

ìExcuse me, but Iím a businessman and tend to be persistent. Assuming that he    was overworked, wouldnít it show itself in arelapse?î            

ìI donít think so,î Dr. Manette said confidently. ìI donít think that anythingbut the one train of thought would bring it back. I think that, from now on,nothing but some extreme memory or association could bring it back. After whathas happened, and after his recovery, I find it hard to believe that such anextreme event could happen again. I trust, and am almost sure, that thecircumstances likely to cause a relapse have already been used up.î             

He spoke with the hesitancy of a man who knew how easy it was to disturb thedelicate organization of the mind, but he also spoke with the confidence of aman who had slowly earned his self-assurance from personal endurance anddistress. It wasnít Mr. Lorryís place to doubt that confidence. Mr. Lorryclaimed to be more relieved and encouraged than he really was and moved on tohis second question. He felt that it was the most difficult of all of them, butremembering his Sunday morning conversation with Miss Pross and what he had seenin the past nine days, he knew that he had to face it.            

ìThe occupation the patient took up during this temporary relapseóî said Mr.Lorry, clearing is throat, ìówe will call it ëblacksmithís work.í Letís say thatduring the dark times in his past, the patient used to work at a little forge.Letís say that we unexpectedly found him at his forge again. Isnít it bad forhim to keep it close to him?î            

The doctor covered his eyes with his hand and tapped his foot nervously on theground.             

ìHe has always kept it by him,î said Mr. Lorry, looking anxiously at thedoctor. ìNow, wouldnít it be better to let it go?î            

The doctor kept his eyes shaded and kept tapping his foot nervously on theground.             

ìDo you find it difficult to give me advice?î said Mr. Lorry. ìI think itís agood question. And yet, I thinkóî Then he shook his head and stopped talking.        

ìYou see,î said Dr. Manette, turning toward him after an uneasy pause, ìitísvery hard to explain consistently the way this poor manís mind works. He oncelonged for that activity so desperately, and it was so welcome when it came. Itrelieved him of his suffering by allowing him to substitute physical work of thefingers for mental work of the mind. By substituting, as he got better at it, hewas able to substitute creativity with his hands for creativity of the mind. Asa result, he has never been able to consider putting it entirely out of reach.Even now, when I believe he has more hope for himself than ever and talks abouthimself with more confidence than ever, the idea that he might need to go backto his blacksmith work and not find it terrifies him as if he were a lostchild.î            

He looked a lot like a lost child as he looked up at Mr. Lorry.            

ìBut might notó Keep in mind, Iím asking for information as a slow businessmanwho only deals with tangible objects like guineas, shillings, and bank notes.Might not the fact that he keeps the object near him mean that he keeps thosememories near him? If the man got rid of the forge, my dear Dr. Manette,wouldnít he get rid of the fears with it? In short, isnít the man giving in tohis fear of relapsing by keeping the forge near him?î            

There was another silence.            

ìYou see too,î said the doctor, nervously, ìit is like an old friend.î            

ìI wouldnít keep it,î said Mr. Lorry, shaking his head. He became moreconfident as he saw that the doctor was uneasy. ìI would tell the patient togive it up. I only lack your power to do it. I am sure it does no good. Come on!Give me your permission, like a good man. For his daughterís sake, my dearManette.î            

It was very strange to see the struggle going on within the doctor.             

ìFor her sake, then, let it be done. I allow it. But I would not take it awaywhile he is there. Take it away when is not there. Let him miss his old friendafter he is gone.î            

Mr. Lorry agreed to this and the conversation was over. They spent the day inthe country, and the doctor was very much returned to normal. Over the threenext days he stayed perfectly well, and on the fourteenth day the doctor left tojoin Lucie and her husband. Mr. Lorry had explained to him that they had madeexcuses for the fact that she hadnít heard from him. Mr. Lorry had written toLucie about it, and she had no suspicions.             

On the night of the day that Dr. Manette left, Mr. Lorry went into his roomwith an axe, saw, chisel, and hammer. Miss Pross went with him and carried alight. There, behind closed doors, and in a mysterious, guilty way, Mr. Lorryhacked the shoemakerís bench into pieces. Miss Pross held the candle as if shewere helping with a murder, which, with her seriousness, she was suited for.They cut it up into small pieces and burned it right away in the kitchen fire.The tools, shoes, and leather were buried in the garden. Destruction and secrecybother honest people so much that Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross, while they destroyedthe bench and tools and got rid of the evidence, looked like accomplices in ahorrible crime.             

When the newlyweds came home, the first person that came to congratulate themwas Sydney Carton. They had only been home for a few hours when he showed up. Hewasnít any better-behaved or better in his appearance than he had been before,but he seemed more fit and dependable in a way that Charles Darnay had nevernoticed before.             

Mr. Carton waited until he had a chance to take Darnay aside to a window tospeak to him privately.             

ìMr. Darnay,î said Carton. ìI hope we can be friends.î            

ìI hope that we are already friends,î said Mr. Darnay.            

ìItís nice of you to say so, since it is the polite thing to say, but I donítmean it as mere politeness. Actually, when I say I want us to be friends, Idonít really mean just that either.î            

Naturally, Charles Darnay asked him what he meant.            

ìUpon my life,î said Carton, smiling, ìitís easier for me to understand thanit is for me to explain. However, let me try. Do you remember the night we wentto the tavern together after your trial? When I was even more drunk thanusual?î            

ìI remember a certain evening when you made me admit to you that you had beendrinking.î            

ìI remember it too. The consequences of those times haunt me, because I alwaysremember them. I hope that God will take my regret into account when I am judgedat the end of my life! Donít worry, though, Iím not going to preach to you.î        

ìIím not worried. When you are sincere it doesnít worry me at all.î            

ìAh!î said Carton, waving his hand casually as if he were waving away Mr.Darnayís comment. ìOn the drunken night in questionóone of many drunken nightsfor me, as you knowóI was rudely speaking about whether I liked you or dislikedyou. I hope you will forget all about it.î            

ìI forgot about it a long time ago.î            

ìYouíre just being polite again! But, Mr. Darnay, it is not as easy for me toforget things as you claim it is for you. I havenít forgotten it at all, and acasual answer doesnít help me forget it.î            

ìPlease forgive me if it was a casual answer,î answered Darnay. ìI was onlytrying to take a minor incident that seems, to my surprise, to bother you toomuch and put it behind us. I give you my word as a gentleman that I forgot aboutit a long time ago. Good Heaven, what was there to forget? Didnít you do a greatfavor for me that day that I should remember?î            

ìI need to tell you that the great favor I did for you was actually justprofessional nonsense,î said Carton. ìI donít think that I cared what happenedto you when I did it. Mind you, Iím saying that that is how I felt back then. Iam speaking about the past.î            

ìYouíre making light of the important thing you did,î answered Darnay. ìBut Iwill not argue about your casual answer.î            

ìItís the complete truth, Mr. Darnay, trust me! I have gone off track fromwhat I wanted to say. Now you know me better. You know Iím incapable of being abetter man. If you donít believe me, ask Mr. Stryver, and heíll tell youso.î            

ìI would rather form my own opinion without hearing from Mr. Stryver.î            

ìWell, at any rate you know that Iím a depraved dog. Iíve never done anythinggood in my life and never will.î             

ìI donít know if its true that you never will.î            

ìBut I do. You must take my word for it. Well! If you could stand to have sucha worthless man with such a bad reputation coming and going here at odd hours,might I be allowed to come and go here as a friend? Think of me as a uselesspiece of furniture that is tolerated because itís been around for so long, andno one notices it. I would call myself an unattractive piece of furniture too ifyou and I didnít look alike. I wonít abuse your permission. Iíd bet a hundred toone that I will only take you up on it four times within a year. It would makeme happy just to know that I had permission to come if I wanted to.î             

ìWill you try to come?î            

ìThatís another way of saying that you will grant me what Iíve asked. Thankyou, Mr. Darnay. I may say that you and I are friends?î            

ìI should think by now that you would, Mr. Carton.î            

They shook hands on the matter, and Sydney Carton turned away. Less than aminute afterward he was as unnoticeable as ever.            

Mr. Carton left, and Charles Darnay spent the evening with Miss Pross, thedoctor, and Mr. Lorry. Darnay mentioned this conversation to them in passing,and he said it was a shame that Sydney Carton was such a careless and recklessman. He spoke of him, in other words, not with bitterness or meanness, but asanyone might who saw the way Mr. Carton behaved.            

He had no idea that his beautiful young wife might be thinking about Mr.Carton, too. But later, when he joined her in their own rooms, she was waitingfor him with the usual pretty frown on her forehead.             

ìYou look concerned about something tonight!î said Darnay, putting his armaround her.            

ìYes, dearest Charles,î she said, with her hands on his chest, She looked athim with a questioning expression. ìI am rather concerned tonight, for I havesomething on my mind.î             

ìWhat is it, my Lucie?î            

ìWill you promise not to ask any questions of me if I ask you not to?î            

ìWill I promise? What wouldnít I promise you, my love?î            

He brushed her golden hair from her cheek and placed his other hand againsther heart.            

ìI think, Charles, that poor Mr. Carton deserves more consideration andrespect than you gave him tonight.î            

ìReally, my love? Why do you say so?î            

ìThat is the question you shouldnít ask me. But I thinkóI knowóthat hedoes.î            

ìIf you know it, itís good enough for me. What do you want me to do, mydarling?î            

ìI want you to always be very kind to him and to forgive his faults when he isnot near. I want you to believe that he is a kind, loving man even though herarely lets anyone see that side of him. He has been hurt very badly. I haveseen it.î            

ìIt hurts me to know that I treated him poorly,î said Charles Darnay,surprised. ìI never knew this about him.î            

ìItís true. Iím afraid he is a lost cause. There is hardly any hope that hecan fix anything about his character or luck, but Iím sure that he is capable ofdoing good, kind, even generous things.î            

Miss Manetteís faith in Mr. Carton made her look so beautiful that her husbandcould have looked at her for hours.             

ìOh, my dearest love!î she said, pulling close to him and putting her head onhis chest. Looking up at him, she said, ìRemember how happy we are, and howmiserable he is!î            

Darnay was moved by her request. ìI will always remember it, dear heart. Iwill remember it as long as I live.î            

He leaned over her golden hair, kissed her, and took her in his arms. If Mr.Carton, who was wandering the streets in the dark, could have heard her innocentconfession and could have seen her husband kiss the tears away from her soft,blue eyes, he might have cried out, ìGod bless her for her sweet compassion!î Itwouldnít have been the first time he had said this about Miss Manette.             

It has been mentioned that the street corner where Dr. Manette lived was awonderful place to hear echoes. As she lived her life of quiet bliss with herhusband, her father, and Miss Pross, and bound them together with her love,Lucie sat in the calm house in the tranquil corner, listening to the echoingfootsteps over the years.            

At first there were times when whatever she was working on would fall slowlyout of her hands and she would look sad, even though overall she was acompletely happy young wife. For there was something coming in the echoes,something far away and barely able to be heard, that upset her. She was caughtbetween feelings of hope and doubtóhopes of a love still unknown to her anddoubts that she would stay on earth long enough to enjoy that love. In theechoes she would hear the sound of footsteps at her own grave, as if she haddied young, and she would think of her husband whom she had left so alone. Inher imagination, he would mourn so much for her that his eyes would overflowwith tears.             

That time passed, and now she had her little Lucie, whom she cradled in herarms. Then she would hear among the echoes the sound of her daughterís tiny feetand her baby talk. She sat beside her cradle and could always hear those sounds,even when the other echoes were very loud. The other echoes came, and the shadedhouse was filled with a childís laughter. God, the friend of children, to whomLucie had told her troubles, seemed to take her child in his arms, as he oncetook the child Christ, and made little Lucie a sacred joy to her.            

In the years that she worked to bring them closer together and make them ahappy family, Lucie heard in the echoes nothing but friendly and soothingsounds. Her husband was strong and prosperous. Her father was stable andhealthy. Miss Pross was like an unruly chargera large, strong cavalry horsecharger who had been tamed and domesticated, andsnorted and pawed at the ground under the plane tree in the garden.            

Even when sad things happened, the echoes were neither harsh nor cruel. Evenwhen they had a son who became sick, Lucieís tears were not all of agony. Beforehe died, their son, who had blond hair like his motherís, lay in bed and said,smiling radiantly, ìDear Papa and Mamma, Iím sorry I have to leave you and mypretty sister, but I am called and must go!î Lucie cried but did not fight backthe tears. She knew her son was going to God.             

Thus, it was like she heard the beating of angelís wings mixing in with theechoes. They sounded unearthly, as if they came from heaven. The sound ofbreezes blowing over a little tomb in a garden mixed with them also, and Lucieheard both of these, in a hushed murmurólike a summer sea lapping against asandy shore. Little Lucie, so serious about her morningís work that she wasfunny to see, or dressing a doll near her motherís footstool, chattered inEnglish and Frenchóthe languages of London and Paris, which had mixed in withher life.             

Sydney Carton rarely came walking down their echoing street corner. About sixtimes a year at most he used his privilege of showing up uninvited, and he wouldsit with them through the evening as he had once done frequently. He was neverdrunk with wine when he came there. And one other thing about him was whisperedin the echoes. It is something that has been whispered by all true echoes for along time.             

Whenever a man has truly loved a woman, lost her, and kept his feelings forher after she has become a wife and a mother, the womanís children have alwaysfelt a strange sympathy for him. No one knows how the children are able to sensethis, but it happens, and that is what happened with Mr. Carton. He was thefirst stranger Little Lucie held out her chubby arms to when she was a baby, andthey maintained their connection as she grew up. The little boy had talked abouthim almost until the day he died, saying, ìPoor Mr. Carton! Give him a kiss forme!î             

Mr. Stryver shoved his way toward success as a lawyer, like a ship plowingthrough rough waters, and dragged his helpful friend Mr. Carton along with him.Sydney, like a sinking boat, had a tough time being dragged along, but since hehad always done so, he continued with that life. Mr. Cartonís attachment to thelife he was used to, unfortunately stronger in him than any desire to desert Mr.Stryver or avoid the disgrace of this life, made that life the one Mr. Cartonwas to lead. He didnít think any more of being the jackal to Mr. Stryverís lionthan a real jackal would think of becoming a lion. Stryver was rich. He hadmarried an old widow with property and three boys, who had nothing particularlyexciting about them but the straight hair on their fat heads.            

Mr. Stryver was a terrible father figure. He had marched the three younggentlemen like sheep to the Manetteís house where he presented them as studentsfor Mr. Darnay. As he did he said crudely, ìHello! Here are three lumps of breadand cheese toward your marriage picnic, Darnay!î When Darnay politely rejectedthem as students, Mr. Stryver became indignant. He later used this to teach theboys a lesson, telling them to beware of the pride of beggars, like that tutorfellow, Darnay. He was also in the habit of telling Mrs. Stryver over his wineall about the clever ways Mrs. Darnay had once used to ìcatchî him, and all theeven more clever ways he had avoided being caught. Some of his colleagues fromthe Kingís Bench, who came there to drink with him excused his lie by saying hehad told it so many times that he now believed it himself. This is surely a wayto make a bad offense worse. It would be justifiable to take anyone who saidthis off to some quiet spot and then hang him.             

These were the sounds Lucie heard in the echoes. Sometimes she was thoughtfulas she listened to them, and sometimes she was happy and laughing. This went onuntil her daughter was six years old. She cared very much about the echoes ofher daughterís steps, and her fatherís, which were always active andself-controlled, and her husbandís. The faintest echoes of their house, whichshe ran with such smart, tasteful thrift that they had more than enough of whatthey needed, were music to her. There were echoes of her father telling her thathe thought she had become even more devoted to him after marrying (if that werepossible) than when she was single. There were echoes of the many times herhusband had said that none of her worries or responsibilities had taken her loveor help away from him and had asked her, ìWhat magic is it that makes you ableto be everything to all of us, as if there were only one of us? Yet, you neverseem hurried or too busy.î            

But there were other echoes that were rumbling off in the distance all thistime. And it was around Little Lucieís sixth birthday that they started to getlouder, like a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising.             

One night in the middle of July 1789, Mr. Lorry came in late from TellsonísBank and sat down by Lucie and her husband in the dark window. It was a hot,wild night, and they were all reminded of that Sunday night years before whenthey had sat in the same place and watched the lightning.             

ìI was starting to think that Iíd have to spend the night at the bank,î saidMr. Lorry, pushing back his brown wig. ìWe were so busy all day that we didnítknow what to do first or where to go. There is such nervousness in Paris thatthere was actually a run to put money in Tellsonís Bank! Ourcustomers in Paris canít seem to transfer their property to us fast enough.Theyíre all practically mad about sending their valuables to England.î            

ìThat looks bad,î said Darnay.             

ìLooks bad, you say, my dear Darnay? Yes, but we donít know what sense thereis in it. People can be so irrational! Some of us at Tellsonís are getting oldand canít be bothered with unusual things happening unless thereís a good reasonfor it.î            

ìStill,î said Darnay, ìyou know how gloomy and threatening the situation isover there.î            

ìDonít I know it,î agreed Mr. Lorry, trying to convince himself that he wasjust in a bad mood and that he was complaining. ìBut I want to complain after mylong, annoying day. Where is Dr. Manette?î            

ìHere he is,î said the doctor, coming into the dark room.             

ìIím happy that youíre at home. All of this anxiousness that Iíve beensurrounded by all day has made me nervous for no reason. Youíre not going out, Ihope?î            

ìNo. Iím going to play backgammon here with you, if you want,î said thedoctor.             

ìI donít think I want to, if I can speak my mind. Iím too worried to competeagainst you tonight. Is the tea tray still there, Lucie? I canít see it.î            

ìOf course. We kept it out for you.î            

ìThank you, my dear. Your precious daughter is safe in bed?î            

ìAnd sleeping soundly.î            

ìThatís right. All is safe and sound! I donít know why everything shouldnít besafe and sound here, thank God. But I have been so overworked all day. Iím notas young as I used to be! My tea, my dear! Thank you. Now, come and join us inour circle. Letís all sit quietly and listen to the echoes that you have yourtheory about.î            

ìItís not a theory; just something I like to imagine.î             

ìItís your imagination then, my wise pet,î said Mr. Lorry, patting her hand.ìThese echoes are very numerous and very loud, though, arenít they? Listen tothem!î            

Charging, crazy, dangerous footsteps were raging in Saint Antoine far away,while a little circle of friends sat in the dark window in London. Footstepsthat could force their way into anyoneís life. Footsteps that could not easilybe cleaned after they have been stained red with blood.             

That morning there had been a wide, dark crowd of scarecrow-like peasantsmoving back and forth in Saint Antoine. Sunlight often gleamed above their headsas it reflected off the steel blades and bayonets they carried. A huge roar cameup from Saint Antoine, and many bare arms waived in the air like shriveled treebranches in the wind. People grabbed at every devilish weapon, or anything thatcould be used as a weapon, that they could find.            

No one knew who gave out the weapons or where they last came from. No one knewwhat made them quiver and jerk over the heads of the crowd, bunches at a time,like a kind of lightning. But muskets were being handed out, and so werecartridges, powder, bullets, bars made of iron and wood, knives, axes, pikes,and anything that the enraged people could turn into a weapon. People whocouldnít find anything else pulled stones and bricks out of walls until theirhands bled. Everyone in Saint Antoine was angry and excited. Every livingcreature there gave no value to life, and was ready with a demented passion tosacrifice its own.            

Just like a whirlpool has a center point, all this turmoil circled aroundDefargeís wine shop. It was as if every person were being pulled toward thecenter, where Defarge, already covered in gunpowder and sweat, was giving ordersand weapons. He was pushing some men back, some forward, taking a weapon awayfrom one man to give it to another, and working hard in the middle of thecommotion.             

ìStay close to me, Jacques Three,î yelled Defarge. ìAnd you, Jacques One andTwo, split up and put yourselves in charge of as many of these patriots as youcan. Where is my wife?î            

ìHey! Here I am!î said Madame Defarge, as calm as ever, but not knittingtoday. Instead, Madame Defarge had an axe in her right hand and a pistol and acruel-looking knife in her girdle.             

ìWhere are you going, my wife?î            

ìIím going with you right now,î said Madame Defarge. ìYouíll see me leadingthe women soon.î            

ìCome, then!î yelled Defarge loudly. ìPatriots and friends, we are ready! Tothe Bastille!î            

With a roar that sounded as if every person in France had yelled the word    Bastille, the crowd of peasants rose up and overflowed thecity. With alarm bells ringing, drums beating, and the crowd thundering like thesea, the attack began.             

There were deep ditches, a double drawbridge, huge stone walls, eight largetowers, cannon, muskets, fire, and smoke to contend with. Through the fire andsmokeóin the fire and smoke, for the crowd forced him up against acannonóMonsieur Defarge the wine seller became a cannoneer. He worked like afierce soldier for two hours.             

Then there was one deep ditch, a single drawbridge, huge stone walls, eightlarge towers, cannon, muskets, fire, and smoke to contend with. One drawbridgehad been taken down! ìWork, my friends, work!î shouted Defarge. ìWork, JacquesOne, Jacques Two, Jacques One Thousand, Jacques Two Thousand, JacquesTwenty-Five Thousand, in the name of all the angels or the devilsówhichever youpreferówork!î So Defarge the wine seller yelled, still at his cannon, which hadlong before grown hot from firing.            

ìGather around me, women!î yelled Madame Defarge. ìWhat! We can kill as wellas the men when we need to!î With a shrill, eager cry, crowds of women followedher. They all carried different weapons, but they were alike in their hunger forrevenge.             

There were still cannons, muskets, fire, and smoke to contend with. There wasstill the deep ditch, the single drawbridge, the huge stone walls, and the eightgreat towers. The crowd changed its shape as people fell down wounded. Therewere flashing weapons, blazing torches, wagonloads of burning wet straw. Peoplewere working hard at barricades everywhere, and there were the sounds of cries,gunfire, curses, unflinching bravery, booms, smashes, rattles, and the furioussounds of the crowd. But there was still the deep ditch, the single drawbridge,the huge stone walls, and the eight large towers. Defarge the wine seller wasstill at his cannon, which was twice as hot after firing for four straighthours.             

A white flag rose from within the castle, and a parleytalks or negotiations between enemiesparley was called for. The flag wasbarely visible through the battle, though, and nothing could be heard over thesounds of the battle. Then suddenly the crowd surged and carried Defarge thewine seller over the lowered drawbridge, past the huge stone outer walls, and intoward the eight large towers that had been surrendered!            

The force of the crowd that was sweeping him along was so powerful that hecouldnít even catch a breath or turn his head until he was in the outercourtyard of the Bastille. There, pushed up against an angle of a wall, hestruggled to look around. Jacques Three was almost beside him, and MadameDefarge could be seen inside in the distance, still leading some of her women.She had her knife in her hand. Everywhere there was commotion, celebration,confusion, and deafening noise.            

ìThe prisoners!î            

ìThe records!î            

ìThe secret prison cells!î            

ìThe torture devices!î            

ìThe prisoners!î            

Of all these cries, and of the ten thousand things people yelled that couldnot be understood, ìThe prisoners!î was the cry that the crowdstarted to repeat. They rushed in as if they would keep pouring in forever. Whenthe first wave of people rushed past, carrying the prison officers with them andthreatening to kill them instantly if they didnít tell them about every inch ofthe prison, Defarge placed his hand on the chest of one of the officers. The manhad gray hair and a lighted torch in his hand, and Defarge pulled him away fromthe rest of them and pushed him up against a wall.             

ìShow me the North Tower!î said Defarge. ìQuick!î            

ìI promise I will if you will come with me,î answered the man. ìBut there isno one there.î            

ìWhat does One Hundred and Five, North Tower mean?î asked Defarge.ìQuick!î            

ìWhat does it mean, monsieur?î            

ìDoes it mean a prisoner, or a cell? Or should I strike you dead?î            

ìKill him!î yelled Jacques Three, who had come up close to him.             

ìMonsieur, it is a cell.î            

ìShow it to me!î            

ìCome this way, then.î            

Jacques Three, looking hungry as usual and apparently disappointed that theconversation had taken a turn that wouldnít lead to bloodshed, held Defargeísarm as Defarge held the prison guardís. Their three heads had been closetogether during this brief conversation, and they could still barely hear eachother since the crowd was so loud as it poured into the fortress and covered thecourts and hallways and staircases. Outside, the walls shook with the roar ofthe crowd too, and individual yells and sounds could occasionally be heard abovethe uproar.             

They made their way through gloomy vaults that had never seen the light ofday, past the ugly doors of dark rooms and cages, down dark flights of steps andback up steep, rough climbs made of stone and brick that were more like drywaterfalls than staircases. Defarge, the guard, and Jacques Three were linkedhand and arm, and they went as fast as they could. Here and there, especially atfirst, the crowd swept past them. But when they had gotten all the way down andwere climbing up a tower, they were alone. Surrounded by the massively thickwalls and arches, they could only hear the sound of the crowd inside and outsidethe fortress as a dull roar, as if the noise from where they had been before hadalmost deafened them.             

The guard stopped at a low door, put a key into the lock, and slowly swung thedoor open. As they all bent down and walked inside, he said:            

ìOne hundred and five, North Tower!            

There was a small window high up in the wall. There was no windowpane in it,and it had a heavy grate over it. There was a stone screen in front of it, sothat the sky could only be seen by stooping over and looking up. There was asmall chimney a few feet inside with heavy bars across it. There was a pile ofold wood ashes on the hearth, and there was a stool, a table, and a straw bed.There were four blackened walls, and a rusted iron ring in one of them.             

ìMove your torch slowly over these walls so that I can see them,î Defarge toldthe guard.             

The man obeyed, and Defarge looked at the wall carefully as the light passedover it.            

ìStop! Look here, Jacques!î            

ìA. M.!î said Jacques Three, reading greedily.             

ìAlexandre Manette,î said Defarge. He traced the letters with his finger,which was covered in gunpowder. ìAnd here he wrote ëa poor physician.í And Iímsure he was the one who scratched this calendar on this stone. What is that inyour hand? A crowbar? Give it to me!î            

He still had the linstocka long staff designed to hold a lit match and used to fire cannonslinstock of his cannon in his hand. Hetraded the gun for the manís crowbar, turned to the worm-eaten stool and table,and smashed them to pieces.            

ìHold the torch higher!î he said to the guard angrily. ìLook through thosepieces carefully, Jacques. And look! Here is my knife.î He threw the knife tohim. ìRip open the bed and look through the straw. Hold the torch higher,you!î            

Looking angrily at the guard, he crawled to the hearth. Peering up thechimney, he poked and prodded at its sides with the crowbar and examined theiron grating across it. In a few minutes, some mortar and dust fell down. Heturned his face away to avoid it and groped carefully in the chimney, in the oldwood ashes, and into chink in the chimney that his crowbar had slipped into.        

ìNothing in the wood, and nothing in the straw, Jacques?î            

ìNothing.î            

ìLetís gather all of it in the middle of the cell. Light them, you!î he saidto the guard.            

The guard set the little pile on fire, and it blazed high and hot. They bentover again to come through the low-arched door, leaving the pile burning behindthem, and went back the way they came to the courtyard. It seemed their hearingreturned as they came down, until they were in the middle of the raging crowdagain.             

The crowd was in a frenzy looking for Defarge himself. The people of SaintAntoine wanted their wine-shop keeper in the front of the group and guarding thegovernor, who had defended the Bastille and shot people. Otherwise, the governorwould not be taken to the Hotel de Ville for judgment. Otherwise he might escapeand the people would not get revenge on their spilled blood, which had beenworthless for so many years but suddenly had value.            

There was only one calm person in the passionate, angry crowd that seemed tobe swallowing up the grim old officer in his gray coat and red decorations. Thatperson was Madame Defarge. ìLook, thereís my husband!î she cried, pointing himout. ìLook at Defarge!î She stood close to the officer and stayed near him. Shestayed close to him through the streets as Defarge and the rest of the crowdbrought him along. She stayed close to him when he was near his destination andpeople began striking at him from behind. She stayed close to him when the crowdstarted to stab and hit him more and more. She was still close to him when hedropped dead from it. Then, suddenly coming alive, she put her foot on his neckand cut off his head with her crude knife.             

The time had come when the people of Saint Antoine put their horrible plan ofhanging men from street lamps into action. The anger of the people of SaintAntoine was up, and the time of tyranny and cruel domination was down. It wasdown on the steps of the Hotel de Ville, where the governorís body lay, and itwas down on the sole of Madame Defargeís shoe, where she had stepped on his bodyto steady it while she cut off his head. ìHang him over there!î yelled thepeople of Saint Antoine, after looking for someone else to kill. ìHere is one ofhis soldiers to guard him!î Then they hung one of the governorís guards too, andthe crowd moved on.             

The crowd was dark, destructive, and violent, and its numbers and force werestill unknown. The crowd of wavering shapes, voices of revenge, and faceshardened by suffering had no pity left in it.             

In the crowd every, face had a fierce, angry expression on it, but there weretwo groups of facesóeach seven in numberóthat were different from the rest.There were seven faces of prisoners who had been freed suddenly by the crowdthat had burst into the Bastille. They were carried high overhead, scared andlost and confused and amazed as if it were the last day on earth and the peoplewho cheered around them were spirits. There were also seven other people carriedhigher by the crowd. Their seven dead faces drooped, as if on their way tojudgment before God. Their faces were unemotional, but their expressions werefrozenónot erased. They were faces that were caught as if they were about toopen their eyes and say to their killers, ìYou did it!î            

Seven prisoners had been released, and seven bloody heads had been put onpikes. There were the keys to the Bastille and its eight strong towers, someletters, and other memorials of prisoners that had been discovered that had diedlong ago of broken hearts. Their footsteps of the people of Saint Antoine echoedas they marched through the streets of Paris in mid-July 1789. Now, Heaven winout over the imagination of Lucie Darnay and keep these feet out of her life!For they are driven, crazy, and dangerous. After so many years since the winecask broke outside the door of Defargeís wine shop, these footsteps canít beeasily cleaned once they are stained red.             

The exhausted people of Saint Antoine had had only one triumphant week toovercome their suffering with embraces and congratulations. Now Madame Defargesat at her counter at the wine shop serving her customers as usual. MadameDefarge wasnít wearing her rose in her hair, for in one short week the largebrotherhood of spies had become extremely cautious, as they knew they could soonbe hanged like the streetlamps.             

Madame Defarge sat out in the morning sun with her arms folded, thinking aboutthe wine shop and the street. In both locations there were several groups ofpeople. They were poor and unhappy, but now they had a noticeable sense of powerplaced over their unhappiness. Even the most miserable person in the mosttattered nightcap was saying, ìI know how hard it has become for me to make aliving, but do you know how easy it has become for me take your life away fromyou?î People who had been unemployed before now had the work of revengeavailable to them at all times. The fingers of the knitting women were vicious,knowing that they could tear. Saint Antoine looked different. It had beenchanging into this for hundreds of years, and the final changes of the past weekwere evident.            

Madame Defarge sat watching the neighborhood. She disguised her pleasure withit, as the leader of the women of Saint Antoine should. Another woman wasknitting next to her. The short, plump wife of a thin, starving grocer and themother of two children, she was like a lieutenant to Madame Defarge. She hadearned the nickname ìThe Vengeance.î            

ìListen!î said The Vengeance. ìWhoís coming?î            

A rumor rushed to them like a line of gunpowder set on fire.             

ìItís Monsieur Defarge,î said Madame Defarge. ìSilence, everyone!î            

Defarge came in out of breath, pulled off the red cap he wore, and lookedaround. ìListen, everyone!î Madame Defarge said again. ìListen to him!î Defargestood there, panting as a crowd of people formed behind him outside the door andwatched him with eager eyes and open mouths. Everyone in the wine shop hadjumped to his feet.             

ìWhat is it, my husband?î            

ìNews from the outside world!î            

ìHow?î yelled Madame angrily. ìThe other world?î            

ìDoes everyone here remember old Foulon, who told starving people that theyshould eat grass, and who died and was sent to hell for it!î            

ìEverybody does!î they all responded.             

ìItís news about him. He is here among us!î            

ìAmong us!î everyone responded. ìAnd dead?î            

ìHeís not dead! He feared us so muchóand for good reasonóthat he pretended tobe dead and had a large fake funeral. But they have found him alive, hiding inthe country, and have brought him back to Paris. I have seen him just now on hisway to the Hotel de Ville. He is a prisoner. I have said that he had goodreasons to be afraid of all of us. Tell me, everyone! Was I right?î            

They all shouted so loudly that a miserable old man more than seventy yearsold would have known in his heart that Defarge was right.             

A moment of profound silence followed. Defarge and his wife looked steadily ateach other. The Vengeance stooped over, and the bang of a drum was heard as shemoved out from behind the counter at her feet.            

ìPatriots!î said Defarge firmly. ìAre we ready?î             

Instantly Madame Defarge had her knife in her girdle. The drum was beating inthe street as if it and the drummer had come together by magic. The Vengeance,shrieking loudly and flinging her arms around over her head like all forty Furiessnake-haired winged goddesses in Greek mythology who punished wrongdoingFuries, wasrunning from house to house, calling the women to action.             

The men were frightful, looking murderously out of the windows, grabbingwhatever weapons they had, and running out into the streets. But the women werea sight that could frighten the bravest person. They ran outside with their hairstreaming behind them, leaving all their household responsibilities, from thechildren to their old and sick family members who were crouching hungry andnaked on their floors. They urged each other and themselves to madness by actingand shouting wildly. ìThe villain Foulon has been taken, Sister! Old Foulon hasbeen taken, Mother! The troublemaker Foulon has been taken, Daughter!î Then,twenty other women ran into the midst of these, pounding on their chests,tearing their hair, and screaming, ìFoulon is alive! Foulon who told thestarving people to eat grass! Foulon who told my aging father that he should eatgrass when I didnít have any bread to give him! Foulon who told my baby to suckon grass when my breasts were dry of milk from starvation! Oh, mother of God,this Foulon! Oh, Heaven our suffering! Hear me, my dead baby and my witheredfather: I swear on my knees, on these stones, to take revenge on Foulon.Husbands, brothers, and young men, kill Foulonógive us his blood, his head, hisheart, his body and soul. Tear him to pieces and bury him in the ground so hewill make the grass grow.î With these cries, many women worked themselves into ablind frenzy and ran around hitting and tearing their own friends until theypassed out from exertion. They were only saved from being trampled under foot bytheir husbands.             

Nevertheless, they didnít lose a moment. Not a moment! Foulon was at the Hotelde Ville, and he might be let go. He would never be let go, though, if thepeople of Saint Antoine knew how they had suffered and been insulted andwronged. Men and women armed with weapons hurried from the neighborhood so fast,bringing everyone nearby with them, that within fifteen minutes no one remainedin Saint Antoine but a few old women and some crying children.            

No. By then they were all crowded into the Hall of Examinationówhere thismean, ugly old man wasó or they overflowed into the nearby streets. Monsieur andMadame Defarge, The Vengeance, and Jacques Three were in the front and veryclose to him in the Hall.             

ìSee!î yelled Madame Defarge, pointing to him with her knife. ìSee the oldvillain tied with ropes. They did well to tie a bunch of grass on his back. Ha,ha! That was done well. Now let him eat it!î Madame put her knife under her armand applauded as if she were at a play.             

The people right behind Madame Defarge explained why she was so happy to thepeople behind them. Those people explained it to other people, and so forth.Soon people were applauding throughout the nearby streets. Similarly, during twoor three hours of talking, the distant members of the crowd took up MadameDefargeís expressions of impatience surprisingly quickly. Quicker because somemen who had climbed up the outside of the building to look in through thewindows knew Madame Defarge well and would relay her expressions to the crowdoutside.             

After a while the sun rose so high that it was shining directly on theprisonerís head, as if giving off rays of hope or protection. This was too muchfor the crowd, and in an instant they charged in and seized him.             

Even the most distant parts of the crowd knew about it right away. Defargejumped over a railing and a table and grabbed the poor man in a deadly embrace.Madame Defarge followed him and twisted in her hand one of the rope he was tiedup with. The Vengeance and Jacques Three hadnít reached them yet, and the men atthe windows hadnít yet jumped down into the Hall, when it seemed that all ofParis had started to yell, ìBring him out! Bring him to a streetlamp!î            

First he was down on the ground, then up again, then falling headfirst on thesteps of the building. Then he was on his knees, then on his feet, then on hisback. He was dragged, beaten, and choked by bunches of grass and straw that wereshoved into his face by hundreds of hands. He was torn and bruised, panting andbleeding, and the whole time he was begging for mercy. He felt agony as peoplepulled each other back from him to get a look. Then a wooden log was pulledthrough the crowd. He was dragged to the nearest street corner, where one of thefatal streetlamps hung. There Madame Defarge let go of him, like a cat might letgo of a mouse. She watched him quietly while they prepared, and he begged herfor mercy. The women screamed at him all this time, and the men yelled that theywanted him to be killed with grass in his mouth. At one point, they hoisted himinto the air and the rope broke, and the crowd caught him as he fell shrieking.It happened again. Then the rope held him, and his severed head was soon upon apike with enough grass in its mouth for the people of Saint Antoine to dance incelebration.             

This wasnít the end of thei dayís bad work. The people of Saint Antoine dancedand shouted so much that they were worked into a frenzy again when they heardthat Fulonís son-in-law, another enemy of the people, was coming to Parisguarded by five hundred cavalrysoldiers on horsebackcavalry alone. The people of Saint Antoine wrote down his crimeson sheets of paper they waved and captured him. They would have captured himfrom an entire army to kill him along with Foulon. They put his head and hisheart on pikes and carried them the old Foulonís head, through the streets in aparade.             

It wasnít until nighttime that the men and women came back to their homes.Their children were crying and hungry, and the poor bakeries were filled withlong lines of people who waited patiently to buy bad bread. While they waitedhungrily, they passed the time by embracing and reliving the triumphs of theday. Eventually these lines of poor people broke up and they left. Then meagerlights began to shine in the windows, and meager fires were made in the streets,where neighbors cooked together, then ate in their doorways afterward.             

They were small, inadequate dinners without meat or much of anything else, butcompanionship added to the meal and made them happier. Fathers and mothers whohad participated fully in the violence of the day played gently with theirchildren. Lovers, surrounded by such a violent world, loved each other and hopedfor the future.             

It was almost morning when Defargeís wine shop was again empty of customers.Monsieur Defarge told his wife with his hoarse voice while he closed thedoor:            

ìIt has come at last, my dear!î            

ìWell, almost,î answered Madame Defarge.             

The people of Saint Antoine went to sleep. The Defarges slept, and even thewoman known as The Vengeance slept with her starved grocer husband. Her drum wassilent. Its noise was the only sound that the bloodshed and commotion of the dayhadnít changed. The Vengeance, as owner of the drum, could have gotten the samesound out of it before or after the Bastille fell or old Foulon was taken. Butthe hoarse voices of the men and women of Saint Antoine had been changedforever.             

The village was different now. It was the village where the fountain oncestood, and where the repairer of roads went every day to try to make enoughmoney working on the highway to feed himself and keep himself alive. Now theprison on the cliff wasnít as intimidating as before. There were soldiers thereto guard it, but not many of them. There were officers to guard the soldiers,but none of these officers knew what his men would doóthey only knew that themen would likely not do what they were ordered.             

The countryside was ruined everywhere. It produced nothing but misery. Everyleaf, blade of grass, and grain was as shriveled and poor as the miserablepeople. Everything was bent over, oppressed, and broken. Houses, fences, farmanimals, men, women, children, and even the soil they lived off ofóall were wornout.             

The upper class was supposed to be a blessing for the country. They madeeverything polite and mannerly and exemplified the life of luxury. Nevertheless,the upper class had somehow brought the country to this state. It was strangethat the upper class, believing the universe had been designed for them, couldbe so quickly stripped of everything! There must be something shortsighted aboutthe way the world was made! This is how it was, though. The upper class didnítrun away from the threats of the pathetic lower class until the last drop ofblood had been removed from the flints, and the last screw of the racka torture device with ratchets at either end that would pull the victimís limbs out of their sockets when turnedthe rack had been turned sooften that its hold gave out, leaving it to turn and turn with no effect.            

But this wasnít the change that took place in the village, and in the manyvillages like it. For many years, the upper class had abused the village and hadhardly even come there except to hunt. Sometimes they came to hunt people,sometimes animals, for which the upper class preserved pieces of wild and barrenwilderness. No. The change was that the rough lower classes were appearing,rather than that the beautiful upper classes were disappearing.            

Now, the repairer of roads worked alone in the dust, not bothering to thinkthat he was made of dust and to dust he would returnIn the book of Genesis in the Bible, God creates man out of dusthe was made of dust and to dust he would return. He wastoo occupied thinking about how little food he had for dinner andhow much more he would eat if he could. Now, as he looked up from working alone,he would often see a poor person walking toward him. This used to be a rareoccurrence, but now it happened frequently. As the person came closer, therepairer of roads would notice without surprise that it was a shaggy-haired manwho looked almost like a barbarian. The man would be tall and wearing woodenshoes that looked clumsy even to the repairer of roads. He would look unhappyand tattered, covered in mud and dust from walking along many highways, and dampwith the moisture of the swamps. He would be covered with thorns, leaves, andmoss from walking many paths through the woods.            

One such man came to him, like a ghost, at noon one day in July. The repairerof roads was sitting on his pile of stones under a bank as he took shelter froma hail shower.             

The man looked at him, looked at the village in the hollow, looked at the milland at the prison on the crag. When he had seen these, he said in a dialect thatwas almost unintelligible:            

ìHowís it going, Jacques?î            

ìAll is well, Jacques.î            

ìTouch then!î            

They joined hands and the man sat on the pile of stones.            

ìNo lunch?î            

ìNothing but dinner now,î said the repairer of roads, looking hungry.            

ìItís the same everywhere,î complained the man. ìNo one has any lunch.î            

He took out a blackened pipe, filled it, and lit it with flint and steel. Hepuffed on it until it was glowing brightly, then suddenly held it away from him.He took something between his finger and thumb and dropped it into the pipe. Itblazed and went out in a puff of smoke.             

ìTouch then.î This time the repairer of roads said it after watching the manput the object in his pipe. They joined hands again.             

ìTonight?î asked the repairer of roads.            

ìTonight,î said the man, putting his pipe in his mouth.             

ìWhere?î            

ìHere.î            

He and the repairer of roads sat on the pile of stones looking silently ateach other. The hail was falling between them like tiny bayonets, and then thesky began to clear over the village.             

ìShow me!î said the man, moving up the hill.            

ìSee!î answered the repairer of roads, pointing with his finger. ìYou go downhere, and straight through the street, and past the fountainóî            

ìTo hell with that!î interrupted the man, looking over the landscape.    ìI donít go through the streets or past any fountains.Well?î            

ìWell! About two leaguesa distance between 2.4 and 4.6 milesleagues past the top of the hill above the village.î            

ìGood. When do you finish work?î            

ìAt sunset.î            

ìWill you wake me up before you leave? I have walked two nights withoutstopping. Let me finish my pipe and Iíll sleep like a baby. Will you wakeme?î            

ìOf course.î            

The traveler smoked the rest of his pipe and put it in his pocket. He took offhis big wooden shoes and lay down on his back on the pile of stones. He fellasleep immediately.            

As the repairer of roads worked his dusty job, the hail clouds moved away toreveal streaks of sky, and the sun gleamed on the landscape. The little repairerof roads, wearing a red cap now instead of his blue one, seemed fascinated bythe man sleeping on the heap of stones. He looked toward him so often that hedid his work mechanically, and, one might say, badly. The tan face, the shaggyblack hair and beard, the coarse wool red cap, the homemade clothes, the hairyskin, the strong frame that had been weakened by poverty, and the way hetightened his lips desperately while he slept, inspired awe in the repairer ofroads. The traveler had traveled far, and his feet were sore from walking. Hisankles were chafed and bleeding, and his big shoes were stuffed with leaves andgrass and must have been heavy to drag over the long distance. There were holesworn in his clothes and sores all over his body. The repairer of roads croucheddown beside him and tried to see if he had any weapons hidden in his shirt oranywhere else. But he didnít see any, because the man was sleeping with his armscrossed in front of him as tightly as his lips were closed. Fortress towns withtheir stockades, guardhouses, gates, trenches, and drawbridges seemed nothingcompared to this man. When he turned his eyes to the horizon and looked around,he imagined he saw other similar figures, unstoppable, traveling to villages allover France.             

The man kept sleeping. He didnít notice the showers of hail and periods ofsunshine, the sunlight or shadow on his face, the lumps of ice on his body, andthe diamond shapes the sun melted them into. The sun was low in the west and thesky was glowing. Then the repairer of roads was ready to go down to the village,so he gathered his tools and all his things and woke the man up.             

ìGood!î said the traveler, lifting himself up on his elbows. ìTwo leagues pastthe top of the hill?î            

ìAbout that.î            

ìAbout that. Good!î            

The repairer of roads went home with dust blowing ahead of him to wherever thewind took it. Soon he was at the fountain, joining the group of thin cows thathad been brought there to drink, and even appearing to whisper to them. When thepeople in the village had eaten their small suppers, they didnít go to bed asusual, but came outside again and stayed there. A strange amount of whisperingwas going on, and when the crowd gathered around the fountain in the dark, theystarted looking at the sky in one particular direction. Monsieur Gabelle, thechief official of the area, became anxious. He went out on his rooftop alone andlooked in the same direction as the crowd. He glanced down from behind hischimneys at the faces in the dark by the fountain below. Then he sent a messageto the sacristan, who had the keys to the church, that they might need to ringthe tocsinalarm belltocsin soon.             

The night grew darker. The trees surrounding the old chateau, which kept itisolated, moved in a rising wind, as though they were threatening the chateau inthe dark. The rain poured down the two flights of steps to the terrace and beatat the large front door, like a messenger trying to wake those inside. Windrushed through the hall among the old spears and knives. With a sighing sound,it went up the stairs and shook the bed curtains where the last marquis hadslept. Four disheveled people stomped through the high grass through the woodstoward the chateau. They came from all directionsóeast, west, north, andsouthóand they broke branches as they walked cautiously to meet up in thecourtyard. They lit four lights there, then moved off in different directions,and then everything was dark again.             

But not for long. Soon, a light came on in the chateau, making it visible andappear as if it were glowing. Then a streak of flickering light could be seenbehind the front of the building. It moved past balustrades, arches, andwindows, lighting them up. Then it went higher and grew brighter. Soon flamesburst out from many of the large windows and the stone faces could be seenstaring out of the fire.             

A faint murmur could be heard from the few people who were left at thechateau. Someone saddled a horse and rode away. There was the sound of someonespurring a horse on and splashing through the dark. The horse, foaming at themouth from exertion, rode past the village fountain and stopped at MonsieurGabelleís door. ìHelp, Gabelle! Help, everyone!î cried the man on the horse. Thealarm bell at the church rang, but there was no other help to come. The repairerof roads and two hundred and fifty of his companions stood at the fountain withtheir arms folded, looking at the pillar of fire in the sky. ìIt must be fortyfeet high,î they said, seriously. They never moved.             

The rider who had come from the chateau and the tired horse continued throughthe village. They galloped up the stony hill to the prison on the cliff. At thegate, a group of officers was looking at the fire, and a little ways off was agroup of soldiers. ìHelp, officers! The chateau is on fire! We might be able tosave valuable objects from the flames if we work fast! Help! Help!î The officerslooked at the soldiers, who were looking at the fire. They didnít give anyorders, just shrugged and answered, ìIt has to burn.î            

As the rider went down the hill again and through the street, the village grewbrighter. The repairer of roads and two hundred and fifty of his companions,inspired by the fire at the chateau, had hurried into their houses and wereputting candles in every little pane of glass in the windows. Since they didníthave much of anything, they decided to force Monsieur Gabelle to lend them someof his candles. When Monsieur Gabelle hesitated to give them the candles, therepairer of roads, who had once been so submissive toward officials, threatenedhim. He said they could always make a fire with Gabelleís carriages and roasthis post horses.             

The chateau was left alone to burn. In the raging fire, a hot wind, issuingfrom the fire, seemed to be blowing the building away. The stone faces looked asif they were being tortured as the flames rose and fell. Large pieces of stoneand wood fell, covering the face with the two dents that resembled the marquis.It became visible again, as if the marquis were being burned at the stake andwere struggling with the fire.             

The chateau burned down, and the trees closest to it also caught on fire andshriveled up. Trees far away, set on fire by the four fierce figures who had setfire to the chateau, sent more smoke to surround the building. Molten lead andiron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain, and the water dried up. Thetowerís tops, which looked like candle extinguishers, disappeared like ice inheat and melted into the flames. Huge splits and cracks appeared in the walls,as if it were crystallizing, and confused birds flew around in circles and fellinto the furnace. The four fierce figures walked away in four differentdirectionsóeast, west, north, and southóalong the dark roads. The light they hadused to set the fire guided them toward their destinations. The village, whichwas lit up with candles, had taken over the alarm bell, and getting rid of theofficial ringer, the villagers rang the bell for joy.            

Moreover, the people of the village were giddy with hunger, fire, and theringing of the bell now. They started to think that Monsieur Gabelle collectedtheir rent and taxes, even though in those later days it was only a small amountof taxes and no rent at all. They wanted to talk to him right away. Theysurrounded his house and told him to come out and talk to them. Monsieur Gabellebarred his door and stayed inside by himself. He went to his rooftop and hidbehind his chimneys. He decided that if they broke his door down (he was a smallman from the South with a vengeful personality) that he would throw himselfheadfirst over the edge and try to crush a person or two below as he fell.        

Monsieur Gabelle must have spent a long night up on his roof, with the burningchateau providing his light, the banging on his door, and the ringing of thealarm bell. Not to mention the fact that on the road in front of his postinghouse gate hung a streetlamp, which the village wanted to replace with hishanging corpse. It was a stressful situation, to be spending an entire summernight on the brink of death, waiting to jump off his roof! But dawn finallyappeared and the candles in the village burned out. The people all left, andMonsieur Gabelle came down from his roof, still alive for the time being.            

Less than a hundred miles away, there were other fires burning and other localofficials who werenít as lucky as Monsieur Gabelle. That night and other nights,when the sun rose, these officials were found hanging in the once-peacefulstreets, where they had been born and raised. Also, there were other villagersand townspeople less fortunate than the repairer of roads and his companions,whom the officials and soldiers defeated and hanged. Regardless, the four fiercefigures who had lit the fire were steadily making their way in four differentdirectionsóeast, west, north, and southóand wherever someone was hanged, fireburned. How many people would have to die to satisfy them no official couldsay.            

Three years went by, and the violence in France grew worse and worse withoutstop, while the people around it watched in terror and wonder. Little LucieManette had three more birthdays in her peaceful home.             

The people at the Manette home had listened to the echoes in the street cornermany days and nights, and their hearts would stop when they heard the crowd offootsteps. The footsteps now sounded like the footsteps of the French people,who had declared their turbulent country to be in danger and ruled it under thered flag of the Republic. They acted like they had been turned into wild beastsby many years of abuse.             

The upper class had distanced itself from the fact that it was hated inFrance. Their presence was so unwanted there that they were in danger of beingexiled from the country or even killed. The situation resembled the story of thefarmer who worked hard to summon the devil, then became so scared when the devilfinally appeared that he ran away before he could ask a question. Likewise, theupper class did much to bring this revolt about, then ran away as soon as theysaw it happening.             

The glittering, bullís-eye-shaped group of Royal Court members was gone, or itwould have been a target for the whole country. It had always been oblivious,since it was proud, extravagant, and blind. Now it had disappeared entirely. Thewhole court, from its exclusive inner circle to the outermost ring ofcorruption, had also disappeared. The king and queen were gone. They had beenovertaken at the palace and were ìsuspendedî when the last wave of rebelliontook it over.             

August 1792 had come, and the upper class of monseigneurs had by this timefled to many different places.             

Naturally, Tellsonís Bank was the headquarters and gathering place of Franceísupper class in London. They say that ghosts haunt the places where their bodiesused to be, and the upper class, without any money left, haunted the place whereits money used to be. Moreover, it was the first place to hear the most reliablenews from France. Tellsonís was a generous company, and it was very kind to oldcustomers who had fallen on hard times. Those noblemen who had realized in timewhat was going to happen, and who had expected their valuables to be seized, hadtransferred much of their wealth to Tellsonís. Their unfortunate countrymenalways talked about them at Tellson's. It must be added that nearly everynew-comer from France reported his arrival and his condition to Tellsonís Bank.Consequently, Tellsonís was like a stock exchange for French information. Thiswas so well-known, and people came there with so many questions about the eventsin France, that Tellsonís sometimes wrote the latest news out and put it up inthe bankís windows for everyone in Temple Bar to read.             

One steamy afternoon, Mr. Lorry sat at his desk. Charles Darnay stood leaningon it, talking to him quietly. The cell-like room, which had once been forinterviews with the head of the bank, was now the newsroom, and it was filled tooverflowing with people. It was within half an hour or so of closing time.        

ìEven though you are as youthful as the youngest man that ever lived,î saidCharles Darnay, hesitating, ìI still have to suggest to youóî            

ìI understand. I am too old?î said Mr. Lorry.            

ìYou will face bad weather, a long journey, unreliable means of traveling, acountry in turmoil, and a city that might not even be safe for you.î            

ìMy dear Charles,î said Mr. Lorry, with cheerful confidence, ìthese are someof the reasons why Iím going, not why I should stay away. It is safe enough forme. Nobody will want to bother an old man whoís almost eighty when there are somany people there that are more worth bothering than me. As far as the citybeing disorganized, if it were not disorganized there would be no reason to sendsomeone from our office here in London to our office in Paris. Someone who knowsthe city and the business well and who can be trusted. As far as the uncertaintraveling, the long trip, and the winter weather, if I werenít ready to suffer abit for the sake of Tellsonís Bank after all these years, who should be?î            

ìI wish I were going myself,î said Charles Darnay. He said it restlessly, andas if he were thinking aloud.            

ìReally? Youíre one to talk!î said Mr. Lorry. ìYou wish you were goingyourself? Youíre a Frenchman. Youíre a smart adviser, arenít you?î            

ìMy dear Mr. Lorry, it is because Iím a Frenchman that the thoughtówhich Ididnít mean to say out loud right nowóhas occurred to me often. I canít helpthinking that I have abandoned the poor people of France,î Darnay said in hisreasonable manner. ìThey might listen to me, and I might be able to persuadethem to restrain themselves. Only last night, after you left us, when I wastalking to Lucieóî            

ìWhen you were talking to Lucie,î Mr. Lorry repeated. ìYes. Iím amazed thatyouíre not ashamed to mention her name! Wishing you were going toFrance!î            

ìHowever, Iím not going,î said Charles Darnay, with a smile. ìThe point isthat you say you're going.î            

ìThe reality is that I am going. The truth is, Charles,î Mr. Lorry glanced atthe head of the bank and lowered his voice, ìyou have no idea how difficult itis for us to conduct business there. Our records and papers in France are inserious danger. Lord knows what might happen to many people if some of ourdocuments were taken or destroyed. And they might be taken at any time, youknow. Who knows if Paris will be set on fire today or ransacked tomorrow? Now,only I can go there, take a careful selection from these documents, and burythem or otherwise get them out of harmís way. Should I stay here when Tellsonísknows this and tells me thisóTellsonís, where I have worked for sixtyyearsóbecause Iím a little old? Why, I am a young boy, sir, compared to a dozenof the old men here!î            

ìHow I admire your bravery and youthful spirit, Mr. Lorry.î            

ìTut! Nonsense, sir! And, my dear Charles,î said Mr. Lorry, glancing at thehead of the bank again, ìremember that getting anything out of Paris right now,no matter what it is, is almost impossible. Some papers and important matterswere brought here just today by the strangest people you could imagine, all ofwhom could have been seized and had their heads chopped off as they passedthrough the barriers out of France. (I'm telling you this in secretóit isunprofessional for me to whisper about it, even to you.) Any other time ourpackages would come and go as easily as they would here in England. Now,everything has stopped.î             

ìAnd are you really leaving tonight?î            

ìIím really leaving tonight. The situation has become too urgent for me todelay.î            

ìAnd you arenít taking anyone with you?î            

ìMany different people have been suggested to me, but I donít want any ofthem. I plan to take Jerry. Jerry has been my bodyguard on Sunday nights for along time and Iím used to him. Nobody will suspect Jerry of being anything butan English ruffian, or of having any idea in his head but to attack anyone whoharms me.î            

ìI have to say again that I admire your bravery and youthfulness.î            

ìI say again thatís nonsense! When I have completed this little task, maybe Iwill accept Tellsonís offer to retire and live the easy life. Iíll have enoughtime then to think about growing old.î            

This conversation had taken place at Mr. Lorryís desk. There were people ofthe French upper-class gathered within a yard or two of it, bragging about whatthey would soon do to avenge themselves on the peasants. It was just like theseupper-class refugees, and just like the way of the British, to talk about thisterrible Revolution as if it had come from nowhereóas if nothing had ever beendone, or had not been done, to cause it. As if no one had seen millions of poorpeople in France suffering, or seen their resources, which should have made themprosperous, squandered. As if no one had seen it coming for years and had evenwritten down what they saw. Such worthless talk, combined with the extravagantplans of the upper class to restore France to its former, unsustainablecondition, was hard for any sane person who knew the truth to listen to. It wasthis kind of nonsense, like the conflict in his head and an uneasiness in hismind, that had made Charles Darnay restless, and that kept him restlessnow.            

Mr. Stryver of the Kingís Bench bar was among the people talking. He was wellon his way to getting a state promotion, and therefore was talking loudly on thesubject. He was explaining to the monseigneurs his plan to blow up the peasantsof France and exterminate them from the face of the earth. He wanted to go onwithout them, and he would eliminate them like you would exterminate eagles bysprinkling salt on their tails. Darnay was particularly offended by Mr.Stryverís comments, and he felt torn between leaving so that he wouldnít hearany more or staying and joining the conversation when something happened.            

The head of the bank approached Mr. Lorry and put a dirty, unopened letter infront of him. He asked if Mr. Lorry had found the person to whom it had beenaddressed. The head of the bank laid the letter down so close to Darnay that hecould see the name, and he noticed it immediately because it was his own name.The address, translated into English, was:            

ìVery urgent. To monsieur formerly known as the Marquis St. Evremonde ofFrance. Care of Tellson and Co. Bank, London, England.î            

On the morning Charles and Lucie got married, Dr. Manette had made one requestof Darnay: that the secret of Darnayís real name should be kept between the twoof them, unless the doctor decided otherwise. Nobody else knew that it wasDarnayís name. Even Charlesís wife, Lucie, had no idea about it, and Mr. Lorrycouldnít know.             

ìNo,î said Mr. Lorry, answering the head of the bank. ìI think I have askedeverybody here, and no one can tell me where to find this gentleman.î            

It was almost closing time at the bank, and the group that was talking passedby Mr. Lorryís desk. He held out the letter to them to see if they knew thename. One after another, the monseigneurs all looked at it resentfully. They allhad something disapproving to say, in French or in English, about this scheming,offensive refugee marquis that no one could find.             

ìHeís the nephew, I believe, or at least the unworthy successor, of theelegant marquis who was murdered,î said one of them. ìIím happy to say I neverknew him.î            

ìHeís a coward who abandoned his post some years ago,î said another. Thisparticular man had snuck out of Paris upside down, almost suffocating, in a loadof hay.            

ìHe was infected with new thought,î said a third, looking at the addressthough a magnifying glass. ìHe opposed the last marquis, abandoned the estateswhen he inherited them, and left them to the peasants. I hope the peasants willpay him back as he deserves.î            

ìHey?î yelled Stryver. ìDid he? Is that the kind of man he is? Letís look athis infamous name. Damn the fellow!î            

Darnay wasnít able to restrain himself any longer. He touched Mr. Stryver onthe shoulder and said:            

ìI know the man.î            

ìDo you, by Jupiter?î said Stryver. ìIím sorry to hear that.î            

ìWhy?î            

ìWhy, Mr. Darnay? Didnít you hear what he did? Donít ask why in thesetimes.î            

ìBut I am asking why.î            

ìThen Iíll tell you again, Mr. Darnay. I am sorry that you know him. I amsorry to hear you asking such extraordinary questions. Here is a man who hasbeen infected by the most diseased, offensive beliefs. He abandoned his propertyto the vilest scum of the earthómurderous peasants. And you ask me why Iím sorrythat you, a teacher to children, knows him? Well, Iíll answer you. Iím sorrybecause I believe that such a scoundrel spreads disease. Thatís why.î            

Remembering his secret, Mr. Darnay struggled to keep himself under control. Hesaid, ìMaybe you donít understand the gentleman.î            

ìI understand how to win an argument, Mr. Darnay,î said the bullying Mr.Stryver. ìAnd Iíll do it. If this fellow is a gentleman, I donít understand him.You can tell him so with my compliments. You can also tell him from me thatafter he gave up his property and title to this mob of butchers, Iím surprisedheís not leading the mob himself. But, no, gentlemen,î said Stryver, lookingaround and snapping his fingers, ìI know something about human nature, and Itell you that youíll never find a man like this man trusting the peasants heclaims to sympathize with. No, gentlemen, heíll always turn and run away veryearly in a fight.î            

With those words, Mr. Stryver snapped his fingers a last time and shoved hisway out into Fleet Street. The group around him who had been listening cheeredand applauded, and Mr. Lorry and Charles Darnay were left alone at the desk asthe bank emptied out.            

ìWill you take the letter?î said Mr. Lorry. ìYou know where to deliverit?î            

ìI do.î            

ìWill you explain that we think it was addressed here in the hopes that wewould know where to forward it, and that it has been here for quite sometime?î            

ìI will. Are you leaving for Paris from here?î            

ìFrom here at eight oíclock.î            

ìI will come back to see you off.î            

Darnay was very unhappy with himself, and with Stryver and the other men. Hemade his way into Temple Bar, opened the letter, and read it. It said:            

ìFrom Abbaye Prison, Paris            

ìJune 21, 1792            

ìTo monsieur formerly known as the marquis.            

ìAfter having my life threatened by the villagers, I have been taken withgreat violence and humiliation and forced to walk a long distance to Paris. Onthe road I have suffered very much, and thatís not all. My house has also beendestroyed.            

ìThe crime they have imprisoned me for, former marquis, is treason against thepeople. Iíll be brought to stand trial in front of the tribunal and executed ifyou do not help me. They say that I have worked against them for an emigrantsomeone who leaves his native country to live somewhere elseemigrant. I havebeen unable to convince them that I was working for them, not against them,according to your instructions. I have been unable to convince them that, beforeyour property was taken away, I paid off the taxes they had stopped paying, thatI had stopped collecting rent from them. Their only response to this was that Iwas acting on behalf of you, an emigrant. They demanded to know where you were.        

ìOh! You, the former marquis, where are you? I yell out in my sleep ëWhere ishe?íî I ask Heaven if you will come and help me. But there is no answer. Oh,you, the former marquis, I have sent this message across the sea, hoping thatyou will find it at Tellsonís Bank and help me!î            

ìFor the love of Heaven, justice, generosity, and the honor of your noblefamily name, I beg you, former marquis, to help release me from prison. My crimeis that I have been faithful to you, and I pray that you will be faithful tome!            

ìFrom this horrible prison, where every hour brings me closer to my death, Ipledge my sad faith, former marquis.            

ìYour suffering servant,            

ìGabelle.î            

The letter awoke Darnayís uneasiness. The fact that his good, old servant,whose only crime was being faithful to Darnay and his family, was in troublemade him feel ashamed. As he walked back and forth in Temple Bar thinking aboutwhat to do, he almost hid is face in shame from the people walking by.             

He knew very well that he had made mistakes. He had acted imperfectly in hishandling of his familyís bad deeds and bad reputation, in his resentfulsuspicions toward his uncle, and in his dislike for Franceís crumbling socialfabric. He knew that, although giving up his privileged place in society hadlong been on his mind, the way he had done it was hurried and incomplete becausehe had fallen in love with Lucie. He had meant to spend more time working it outand supervising it, but had never done so.             

He knew that he had been distracted by the happiness of the life he had chosenin England, the necessity of having to work all the time, and the speed withwhich the troubles came about in France. The situation kept changing, and hisplans kept changing with it. He knew that he had given into these circumstances,and though he had been concerned, he had been busy with other things. He hadwatched the events in France and waited for a time to act. Now it was too late.The nobles were leaving France by every road and highway, their property wasbeing taken away or destroyed, and their family names were being erased. Darnayknew all of this as well as any of the people now ruling France knew it, andthose people might hold him responsible for some of it.            

But he hadnít hurt anyone, and he hadnít imprisoned anyone. He was so far fromhaving cruelly forced the peasants to pay taxes to him that he had given up hissocial position of his own free will. Instead he had gone out into the worldwithout the advantage of his title to earn a living for himself. MonsieurGabelle had taken care of the poor and complex estate under written orders. Hewas told to spare the people, to give them what little there was leftówhateverfuel the tax collectors would let them have during the winter and whatever foodwas left during summer. He had put it all in writing so that there would beproof if he needed it now.            

This started to persuade Charles Darnay that he needed to go back to Paris.        

Yes. Like the mariner in the old storyThe Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Samuel Coleridgemariner in the old story, he was being pulled back as if to a magnet. He had to go backto France. Everything he thought of inspired him to move faster and moresteadily toward France. He had been worried that bad people were making thesituation bad in France. As someone who knew better than them, he should bethere trying to stop the bloodshed and convincing them to be merciful andhumane. With this uneasiness, half suppressed and half reprimanding him, heended up comparing himself to Gabelle, the old gentleman who had been sodedicated to him. Immediately after this he thought of the sneers of his uncle,the monseigneur, which had stung him so badly, and Stryverís comments, whichbothered him most of all. Then he thought of Gabelleís letter: the plea of aninnocent prisoner who could be executed and have his justice, honor, and goodname die with him.             

He made his decision. He had to go to Paris.             

Yes. The Loadstone Rockmagnetite or something that acts as a magnetLoadstone Rock was drawing him, and he had to go toward it until hereturned to France. He didnít know that there was danger waiting for him there.He thought the people in France would happily understand the reason why he haddone what he did once he arrived to explain himself. He thought of the good deedhe had tried to do, which is often the optimistic illusion of many good people,and he saw himself as someone who could help to lead the Revolution that hadgotten so out of control.             

As he walked back and forth, having made his decision, he thought that neitherLucie nor her father should know about it until he had already left. Lucieshould be spared the pain of saying goodbye, and her father, who was alwaysreluctant to think about his past, should find it out as something that hadalready happened. He shouldnít have to deal with the suspense of not knowingwhether Charles would go. Darnay wouldnít reflect on how much his doubts aboutgoing were because of her father. But Dr. Manetteís circumstances also affectedhis decision.             

He walked back and forth thinking, until it was time to go back to Tellsonísand send off Mr. Lorry. As soon as he arrived in Paris he would find Mr. Lorryagain, but he wouldnít say anything about his plans now.             

A carriage with post horses was waiting at the door of the bank, and Jerry wasthere dressed and ready.             

ìI have delivered that letter,î said Charles Darnay to Mr. Lorry. ìI wouldnítlet him give me a written answer, but will you take a verbal answer?î            

ìI will, happily,î said Mr. Lorry, ìif itís not dangerous.î            

ìItís not dangerous at all, though it is to a prisoner at the AbbayePrison.î            

ìWhatís his name?î said Mr. Lorry. He had his pocketbook in his hand.            

ìGabelle.î            

ìGabelle. And what is the message to the unlucky prisoner Gabelle?î            

ìItís simply that ëhe has received the letter and will come.íî            

ìAt a specific time?î            

ìHe will leave tomorrow night.î            

ìAny particular person?î            

ìNo.î            

He helped Mr. Lorry wrap himself in several coats and cloaks and went out withhim from the warm, old bank into the cold misty air of Fleet Street. ìGive mylove to Lucie and little Lucie,î said Mr. Lorry, as they said goodbye. ìAnd takegood care of them until I come back.î Charles Darnay shook his head and smileduncertainly as the carriage rolled away.             

It was the fourteenth of August, and that night Darnay sat up late and wrotetwo passionate letters. One was to Lucie, explaining his need to go to Paris andassuring her that he would not come to any harm there. The other letter was tothe doctor, telling him to take care of Lucie and their daughter, and reassuringhim as well that he would be fine. To both of them he wrote that he would sendthem letters to let them know he was safe as soon as he arrived.             

It was hard being with them that day, with the first worries of their marriedlife on his mind. It was hard to keep the secret that they had no suspicions of.But a loving look to his happy, busy wife convinced him not to tell her what wasabout to happen. (He had almost been moved to tell her; it was so strange to doanything without her quiet help). The day went by quickly, and early in theevening he embraced her and their daughter, pretending that he would come backsoon (he told them he had an appointment and had to go out, and he had snuck outa suitcase full of clothes). Then he went out into the heavy mist in the streetswith a heavy heart.             

The magnet was drawing him quickly back to France now, and the winds and tideswere heading toward it. He left his two letters with a trustworthy porter andtold him to deliver them half an hour before midnight, but no sooner. He took ahorse to Dover and started his journey. ìFor the love of Heaven, justice,generosity, and of the honor of your family name!î was what Gabelle, the poorprisoner, had said. Darnay recalled these words, which gave him strength as heleft all that he loved on earth behind him, and sailed back toward France.        

The end of Book Two.             

It took a traveler a long time to go from England to Paris in the fall of1792. There were many bad roads, bad carriages, and bad horses that would havedelayed him, even though the king of France was still ruling on the throne inall of his glory. Now that the times had changed, there were even moreobstacles. Citizen-patriots with their muskets ready to fire had taken overevery town gate and village taxing-house. They would stop everyone as they cameand went, question them, examine their papers, and look for their names on theirlists. They would make them turn back or send them on their way, and sometimesthey would stop them and seize them. It all depended on what their impulsivejudgment led them to believe was best for the new Republic, which had theslogan, ìOne and Indivisible, with Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, orDeath.î            

Charles Darnay had only traveled a few leagues into France when he began tonotice that there was no hope of his going back until he had been declared agood citizen in Paris. Whatever might happen to him now, he had to continue onto his destination. He knew that every village and barrier he passed through wasanother obstacle between him and England. He was watched so carefully that hewouldnít have felt more like a prisoner even if he had been caught in a net, orwere being sent to his destination in a cage.            

Being watched so carefully not only meant that he was stopped on the highwaytwenty times during each leg of his journey, but he was also slowed down twentytimes a day. People would follow him and then make him go back, or they wouldride ahead of him and stop him, or ride with him and keep watch over him. He hadbeen traveling in France for several days when he went to bed exhausted in alittle town on a road still far away from Paris.             

If he hadnít shown them poor Gabelleís letter from Abbaye Prison, he would nothave gotten that far. He had so much trouble at the guardhouse in this smalltown that he thought he was in danger. Because of this he was especiallysurprised when he was woken up in the small inn where he was staying in themiddle of the night.             

A timid local official and three armed patriots with rough red caps and pipesin their mouths woke him. They sat down on the bed.             

ìEmigrant,î said the official, ìI am going to send you to Paris with anescort.î            

ìCitizen, I want nothing more than to get to Paris, though I donít need anescort.î            

ìQuiet!î said one of the men in the red caps, hitting the bedcover with thehandle of his musket. ìQuiet, aristocrat!î            

ìWhat this man says is true,î said the timid official. ìYou are an aristocratand so you need an escort. And you must pay us for it.î             

ìI have no choice,î said Charles Darnay.            

ìChoice! Listen to him!î yelled the same angry man in the red cap. ìAs if wewerenít doing him a favor by keeping him from being hanged from astreetlamp!î            

ìWhat this patriot says is always right,î said the official. ìGet up and getdressed, emigrant.î            

Darnay did as he was told. He was taken back to the guardhouse where otherpatriots in rough red caps were smoking, drinking, and sleeping by a campfire.He paid them a great deal of money to be his escort, and then they started outon the wet roads at three oíclock in the morning.             

The escort was made up of two patriots in red caps and three-colored cockadesan ornament worn on a hat as a badgecockades. Theywere armed with muskets and sabers and rode along on horses on either side ofhim.             

Charles Darnay controlled his own horse, but a loose rope was tied to thebridle. One of the escorts kept the end of the rope tied around his wrist. Theyheaded out this way with the rain hitting their faces, clattering at a quicktrot over the uneven paved street of the town and out onto the muddy roads. Theyoccasionally changed horses or changed the pace at which they were traveling,but otherwise nothing changed during the whole muddy journey to Paris.             

They traveled at night, stopping an hour or two after daybreak and waitinguntil twilight to start again. The escorts were dressed so poorly that theywrapped straw around their bare legs and their shoulders to keep from gettingwet. Besides the inconvenience of having the escort, and the danger of one ofthe escorts always being drunk and carrying his musket in a reckless way,Charles Darnay didnít fear being treated as a captive. It had nothing to do withhis particular situation, he thought. He hadnít explained why he was there yet,and he knew his story could be confirmed by Gabelle, the prisoner at the AbbayePrison.             

They came to the town of Beauvais in the evening. The streets were filled withpeople, and now Darnay couldnít help thinking that things looked upsetting. Athreatening crowd gathered to see him dismount from his horse at the postingyard. Many people yelled out loudly, ìDown with the emigrant!î            

He stopped as he was getting out of his saddle and decided that it was saferto stay on his horse.             

ìYou call me an emigrant, my friends? Donít you see that Iím here in France bymy own choice?î            

ìYou are a cursed emigrant,î yelled a farriersomeone who makes horseshoesfarrier. The man rushed at him through thecrowd waving his hammer in his hand. ìAnd you are a cursed aristocrat!î            

The postmaster got between the man and the riderís bridle, which is what theman was apparently moving toward. He said soothingly, ìLeave him alone! He willbe judged in Paris.î            

ìJudged!î repeated the farrier, swinging his hammer. ìYes, and heíll becondemned as a traitor.î At this the crowd roared in approval.             

The drunken escort sat calmly in his saddle watching with the rope around hiswrist. Darnay looked at the postmaster, who was trying to turn the horseís headtoward the yard. As soon as he could make himself heard, he said:            

ìFriends, you are mistaken. Or you have been misinformed. I am not atraitor.î            

ìHe lies!î yelled the farrier. ìHe is a traitor since they made the decree.His cursed life doesnít belong to him anymore. His life belongs to the people ofFrance!î            

Darnay saw hatred in the eyes of the crowd. In another moment they would havecharged at him. The postmaster turned his horse into the yard. The escort rodeclose beside him, and the postmaster shut and barred the double gates. Thefarrier hit the gates with his hammer and the crowd groaned but did nothingelse.             

ìWhat decree was the smith talking about?î Darnay asked the postmaster afterhe had thanked him and stood next to him in the yard.             

ìItís a decree for selling property of emigrants.î            

ìWhen was it passed?î            

ìOn the fourteenth.î            

ìThatís the day I left England!î            

ìEverybody says it is just one of many, and that there will be more decrees,if there arenít already, that will banish all emigrants and condemn them todeath if they return. Thatís what he meant when he said your life is no longeryour own.î            

ìBut there are no decrees like that yet?î            

ìI donít know,î said the postmaster, shrugging his shoulders. ìThere might be,or there will be. What difference does it make?î            

They rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night, and thenthey continued riding on while all the townspeople were asleep. Darnay saw manychanges in his former country that made his journey feel unreal, and one of thebiggest was how little people slept. After riding for long, lonely periods oftime over dreary roads, they would see a group of poor cottages that werenítdark like the others but were all lit up. They would find people gatheredtogether like ghosts in the middle of the night. They would be in a circle,holding hands around a shriveled tree of liberty, or all gathered togethersinging a liberty song. Luckily, though, everyone was sleeping in Beauvais thatnight, so they were able to leave and continue on their lonely journey. Theirhorses jingled as they traveled through the unusually cold, wet night and amongthe poor fields that had given no crops that year. They saw blackened remains ofhouses that had been burned down. Sometimes they would suddenly be ambushed andhave galloping toward them the patriot patrols that were watching all the roads.        

At daylight they were finally at the walls of Paris. The barrier was closedand guarded by many men when they rode up to it.             

ìWhere are the prisonerís papers?î asked a resolute-looking man in charge, whowas called out by the guard.            

Charles Darnay naturally noticed their use of the word    prisoner. He asked the man to recognize that he was a freetraveler and a French citizen. He told him that the dangerous situation in thecountry made it necessary for him to travel with an escort, and that he had paidthese men to escort him.             

ìWhere are the prisonerís paper?î repeated the man, ignoring him.             

The drunken patriot took Darnayís papers out of his cap. Looking overGabelleís letter, the same man in charge seemed surprised. He looked at Darnaycarefully.            

He left Darnay and the escorts without saying a word and went into theguardroom. They sat on their horses and waited for him outside the gate. As helooked around while waiting anxiously, Charles Darnay saw that the gate wasbeing guarded by a combination of soldiers and citizens, with citizens faroutnumbering the soldiers. While the entrance into the city for peasants withcarts full of supplies and other such traffic was easy to get though, the exit,even for the poorest peasants, was very difficult. A large group of men andwomen, not to mention animals and vehicles of various kinds, was waiting toleave. It took so long to check their identification that they moved through thebarrier very slowly. Some of these people knew that they had so long to waitbefore they were questioned that they were lying on the ground sleeping orsmoking. Others chatted together or hung around. Every man and woman wore a redcap and a three-colored cockade.             

After Darnay had waited on his horse for half an hour noticing these things,the same man in charge came out and told the guard to open the barrier. Then hegave the drunken sober escorts a receipt for Darnay and asked Darnay to get downoff his horse. He did so, and the two escorts, leading Darnayís tired horse,turned and rode away without entering the city.             

He went with the guard into a guardroom. It smelled of wine and cigarettesmoke, and there were several soldiers and citizens there, standing or lyingaround. Some were sleeping, some were awake, some were drunk, and some weresober. Some were in various states between asleep and awake, or drunk and sober.The light in the guardhouse came partly from the fading oil lamps and partlyfrom the overcast day. Some books of lists were lying open on a desk, and arough, dark-looking officer was in charge of these.            

ìCitizen Defarge,î the officer said to the guard escorting Darnay as he tookout a slip of paper to write on. ìIs this the emigrant Evremonde?î            

ìThis is the man.î            

ìHow old are you, Evremonde?î            

ìThirty-seven.î            

ìAre you married, Evremonde?î            

ìYes.î            

ìWhere were you married?î            

ìIn England.î            

ìOf course you were. Where is your wife, Evremonde?î            

ìShe is in England.î            

ìOf course she is. You will be sent to La Force Prison, Evremonde.î            

ìBy Heaven!î exclaimed Darnay. ìUnder what law, and for what crime?î            

The officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment.            

ìWe have new laws, Evremonde, and new crimes, since you were last in France.îHe smiled cruelly as he said it and continued writing.            

ìPlease know that I have come here by my own choice, in response to thatletter you have in front of you. A fellow countryman begged me to return andhelp him. All I want is the chance to do so as soon as possible. Isnít that myright?î            

ìEmigrants have no rights, Evremonde,î the man answered coldly. The officerfinished writing. He read over to himself what he had written, sealed it, andhanded it to Defarge, telling him, ìIn secret.î             

Defarge gestured to Darnay with the paper that he had to follow him. Darnayobeyed, and two armed citizens went with them.             

ìAre you the one who married the daughter of Dr. Manette, who was once aprisoner in the Bastille but was released?î asked Defarge quietly as they wentdown the guardhouse steps and walked out into the streets of Paris.             

ìYes,î answered Darnay, with a surprised look.             

ìMy name is Defarge. I own a wine shop in the Saint Antoine Quarter. Maybe youhave heard of me.î            

ìMy wife came to your house to take back her father? Yes!î            

The word wife caused Defarge to say suddenly, ìIn the name ofthat new invention called the guillotine, why did you come back toFrance?î            

ìYou heard me say it a minute ago. You donít believe itís the truth?î            

ìItís a bad truth for you,î said Defarge, speaking with a frown and lookingstraight ahead.             

ìTruly I feel lost here. Everything is so new, so different, so sudden andunjust, that I feel lost. Can you help me?î            

ìNo.î Defarge kept looking straight ahead as he spoke.             

ìWill you answer one question for me?î            

ìMaybe. Depending on what it is. What is it?î            

ìIn this prison that I am going to so unjustly, will I have some way ofcommunicating with the outside world?î            

ìYouíll see.î            

ìAm I going to be shut up there without a trial or any chance to present mycase?î            

ìYouíll see. But, what then? Other people have been shut up in worse prisonsbefore in the same way.î            

ìBut not by me, Citizen Defarge.î            

Defarge looked at him for an answer. He walked steadily on in silence, and thequieter he became, the less Darnay hoped that Defarge might soften. Therefore,he said quickly:            

ìIt is very important to meóyou know even better than I do how important itisóthat I am able to tell Mr. Lorry of Tellsonís Bank that I have been throwninto La Force Prison. Mr. Lorry is an English gentleman who is in Paris rightnow. Will you be able to tell him for me?î            

ìI will do nothing for you,î said Defarge, stubbornly. ìMy duty is to mycountry and its people. I have sworn to serve them against people like you. Iwill do nothing for you.î            

Charles Darnay felt that it was hopeless to beg him anymore, and he was alsotoo proud to do so. As they walked on in silence, he couldnít help noticing howthe people seemed to be used to seeing prisoners moving through the streets.Even the children barely noticed him. A few people passing by turned to look athim, and a few shook their fingers at him for being an aristocrat. Butotherwise, the fact that a well-dressed man was going to prison was no morespecial than if a man in work clothes should be going to work. In one narrow,dark, and dirty street that they passed through, an excited speaker was standingon a stool and speaking to an excited audience about crimes against the peopleof the king and the royal family. The few words that Charles Darnay heard theman say let him know that the king was in prison and that all the foreignambassadors had left Paris. Except for when he had been in Beauvais, he hadheard no news on the road. His escort and the fact that he was so closelywatched had isolated him.            

He knew now that France was a much more dangerous place for him currently thanit had been when he had left England. He knew that danger had come upon himquickly and that things might get more and more dangerous for him. He had toadmit to himself that he might not have come if he had known what would happen.And yet his concerns werenít as ominous as you would think, looking back on itfrom this happier time. Troubled as his future was, he didnít know his future.He knew so little about the coming massacreóa horrible massacre that would go onfor days and nights and that would taint the gathering time of the harvest withbloodshedóit could have been a hundred thousand years away. The new invention ofthe guillotine was hardly known by name to him, or the people of France. Theterrible things that would soon be done probably didnít even exist in the mindsof the people who would do them yet. How could gentle people imagine suchthings?             

He had expected to be treated harshly and possibly detained. He expected tomiss his wife and child. But beyond this, he wasnít afraid of anything specific.These were his thoughts as he arrived at La Force Prison.             

A man with a swollen face opened a small window in the door of the prison.Defarge told him, ìThis is the emigrant Evremonde.î            

ìWhat the devil! How many more of them are there?î exclaimed the man with theswollen face.             

Defarge ignored the manís comment and took a receipt from him. He left withthe two citizen guards.            

ìI say again, what the devil!î exclaimed the jailer to his wife. ìHow manymore?î            

The jailerís wife didnít have an answer for him. She merely said, ìYou have tohave patience, my dear!î She rang a bell and three prison guards entered. Theysaid the same thing, and one of them added the phrase ìFor the love of liberty,îwhich was a strange phrase to hear in a prison.            

La Force Prison was a gloomy place. It was dark and filthy and had thehorrible smell of foul sleep. It is extraordinary how soon the offensive smellof imprisoned sleep becomes apparent in places that are poorly cared for.        

ìIn secret, too,î complained the jailer, reading the slip of paper. ìAs if theprison wasnít already full to bursting!î            

He stuck the paper on a file angrily, and Charles Darnay waited for him forhalf an hour. Sometimes he would pace back and forth in the holding room, andsometimes he would sit on a stone seat. In either case, he stayed long enoughthat the chief and his staff remembered him.             

ìCome!î said the chief, finally picking up his keys, ìcome with me,emigrant.î            

Another guard took him through the dark corridors and staircases of theprison. Many doors clanged and locked behind them. Finally they came into alarge, low room with vaulted ceilings. It was filled with men and women who wereprisoners. The women were sitting at a long table, reading, writing, knitting,sewing, and embroidering. The men were mostly standing behind their chairs orwandering up and down the room.             

Darnay withdrew from these people instinctively, associating prisoners withcrime and disgrace. But the greatest unreality of his long ride was now their infront of him, as he saw the refinement and grace of these prisoners, who wereall members of the upper class.             

These refined manners seemed so out of place in the gloom of the prison thatCharles Darnay felt as if he were surrounded by ghosts. These ghosts of beauty,stateliness, elegance, pride, frivolity, wit, youth, and age were all waitinghere to leave earth. They all looked at him with eyes that had been changed bythe death they had died in being imprisoned there.            

He was so shocked he couldnít move. The jailer was standing at his side, andthe other jailers were moving around. They would have looked nice enough undernormal conditions, but they looked especially rough contrasted with the sadmothers and beautiful young daughters who were prisoners there: the ghosts ofthe young flirt, the young beauty and the genteel old woman. This contrast madethe feeling that all normalcy had been turned upside down all the stronger.Surely, they were all ghosts. Surely, Darnayís long, strange journey throughFrance was actually a disease that had killed him and brought him to thesegloomy shades!            

ìIn the name of this group of friends who have all faced the same misfortune,I have the honor of welcoming you to La Force Prison,î said a well-dressed andwell-spoken gentleman as he came forward. ìI give you my sympathy for thedisaster that has brought you here. May it all soon end happily! It would berude to do so elsewhere, but it is not hereómay I ask, what is your name andtitle?î            

Charles Darnay revived himself and told him the information as well as hecould.            

ìBut I hope that you were not brought here in secret?î said the gentleman ashe watched the chief jailer move across the room as he spoke.             

ìI donít understand the meaning of the phrase, but I heard them say that Iwas.î            

ìAh, what a pity! Weíre sorry to hear that. But be brave. Several people thathave been here were brought in secret at first and it didnít last long.î Then heraised his voice and spoke to the others. ìIím sorry to tell you all this, buthe was brought here in secret.î            

The group murmured sympathetically as Charles Darnay walked across the room toa grated door, where the jailer waited for him. Many voicesóamong which the softand compassionate voices of women were noticeableógave him good wishes andencouragement. He turned at the grated door to thank them. The jailer closed thedoor, and he never saw the ghostlike people again.             

The gate opened onto a stone staircase, leading upward. When they had climbedforty steps (Darnay, who had only been a prisoner for half an hour, alreadycounted them), the jailer opened a low, black door, and they entered a lonelycell. It was cold and damp but was not dark.             

ìThis is your cell,î said the jailer.             

ìWhy am I locked up alone?î            

ìHow do I know!î            

ìCan I buy a pen, ink, and paper from you?î            

ìThose were not my orders. You will be visited and can ask for them then, butfor now you can only buy your food.î            

In the cell there was a chair, a table, and a straw mattress. The jailerinspected these objects and the four walls before going out. Darnay had thethought as he leaned against the opposite wall that this jailer was so swollen,both in his face and his body, that he looked like a man who had drowned andfilled with water. When the jailer was gone, he thought, ìNow Iíve been left fordead.î He stopped then and looked down at the mattress. He turned away from itfeeling sick and thought, ìAnd here these crawling creatures are the first thingto happen to a body after death.î            

ìFive paces wide by four and a half paces long,î Darnay thought over and over.He walked back and forth in his cell, measuring it. He could hear the sounds ofParis below him like muffled drums and voices. ìDr. Manette made shoes,î hethought over and over again. Darnay measured it again and walked faster todistract himself from the later thought. ìThe ghostlike figures that disappearedwhen the gate was closed. There was one woman in black among them, leaning inthe window. There was light shining on her golden hair, and she looked like óóLetís ride on again, for Godís sake, through the lit-up villages when all thepeople are awake! óó He made shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes. óó Five pacesby four and a half.î These bits of thought ran through his mind as Darnay walkedfaster and faster, stubbornly counting again and again. The sounds of Parischanged. They still sounded like muffled drums, but with the wail of voices heknew mixed in the swell of sound that rose above them.            

The branch of Tellsonís Bank in the Saint Germaine Quarter of Paris was in onewing of a large house. It was accessible by a courtyard and closed off from thestreet by a high wall and strong gate. The house had belonged to a wealthynobleman, who had lived in it until he fled Paris in his cookís clothes andsnuck across the border. This man, who fled like an animal being chased byhunters, was the same monseigneur who had needed three strong servants plus hiscook to serve him his chocolate.             

Now the monseigneur was gone. The three former servants had made up for havingworked for him by being more than ready and willing to cut his throat in thename of the Republic. The people had first taken control of the monseigneuríshouse, then took it away from him entirely. Things were changing so fast anddecrees were announced so quickly that now, on September third, representativesof the new government had possession of monseigneurís house. They had marked itwith the flag of the Republic and were drinking brandy inside.             

If Tellsonís Bank in London had been like Tellsonís Bank in Paris, it wouldhave driven the head of the bank crazy. What would the serious, respectable,responsible British men at Tellsonís have thought of the orange trees in boxesin the bankís courtyard, or the sculpture of Cupid that hung over the counter?But such things were in the Paris bank. Tellsonís had painted the Cupid white,but you could still see him on the ceiling. The figure was wearing linen andaiming his arrows at money, as love often does. In London, this Cupid, themirror on the wall, and the young clerks who danced in public every chance theygot would surely lead to the bankís failure. Yet, Tellsonís Bank in Franceprospered under these conditions. As long as things didnít get too out of handin France, no one was concerned enough to withdraw his money.             

That night, no man could say how much money would be drawn out of TellsonísBank in Paris, or how much would stay there, lost and forgotten. No man couldsay what plates and jewels would stay hidden in the bankís vaults while theowners of those items grew old in prison, or when those owners would dieviolently. No man could say how many accounts with Tellsonís would never besettled in this world, but carried into the next by their deceased owners. Noman could answer these questions any more than Mr. Jarvis Lorry could, though hethought seriously about these things. He sat by a newly lit wood fire (it hadturned cold early this year), and on his honest and brave face was a dark lookof horror.             

He was so dedicated to Tellsonís that he stayed in rooms in the bank. It mademembers of the bank feel secure to know that patriots occupied the mainbuilding, but the honest Mr. Lorry didnít think about that. He didnít care aboutthese circumstances, only that he did his job. On the other side of thecourtyard, under a row of columns, there was a good deal of room for carriages.Some of the monseigneurís carriages were still kept there. Against two of thepillars were fastened two large flaring torches, and in their light, standingout in the open, was a large grindstonea stone used for sharpeninggrindstone. It hadbeen mounted there quickly and looked likeit had been brought from some nearby blacksmith or other workshop. Mr. Lorry gotup and looked out the window at these harmless objects. He shivered and wentback to his seat by the fireplace. He had opened the window as well as thelattice blinds outside, and then closed them again. A chill passed through hisbody.             

The usual sounds of the city at night could be heard from the streets past thehigh wall and the strong gate. Now and then an indescribable ring sounded amongthe noise of the city. It sounded weird and otherworldly, as if some unusual,terrible sounds were traveling up to Heaven.             

ìThank God that no one that I care deeply about is in this awful citytonight,î said Mr. Lorry, clasping his hands. ìMay God have mercy on all thosewho are in danger!î            

Soon afterward, the bell at the gate rang, and he thought, ìTheyíve comeback!î He sat there, listening, but there was no loud noise of someone cominginto the courtyard as he had expected. The gate clanged again, and theneverything was quiet.             

He felt nervous and fearful, and it made him worry about the security of thebank. It was well guarded, and he got up to move closer to the trusty people whowere watching over it. Suddenly the door opened and two people rushed in. Hefell back in shock when he saw them.             

It was Lucie and her father! Lucie had her arms stretched out toward him. Shehad that same old look of intense concentration and concern on her face. Itseemed like it had been stamped there for this one particular moment in herlife.             

ìWhat is this?î yelled Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused. ìWhatís the matter?Lucie! Dr. Manette! Whatís happened? Why are you here? What is it?î            

She looked at him, pale and upset. She said, panting, ìOh my dear friend! Itísmy husband!î            

ìYour husband, Lucie?î            

ìCharles.î            

ìWhat about Charles?î            

ìHe is here.î            

ìHere in Paris?î            

ìHeís been here for three or four days, I donít know how many exactly. I canítthink straight. A errand of kindness brought him here. We didnít know he wascoming. He was stopped at the barrier and sent to prison.î            

Mr. Lorry cried out. Almost at the same moment, the bell at the front gaterang again and a loud noise of footsteps and voices could be heard entering thecourtyard.             

ìWhat is that noise?î asked Dr. Manette, going to the window.             

ìDonít look!î yelled Mr. Lorry. ìDonít look out! Dr. Manette, donít touch theblind!î             

The doctor turned toward him, with his hand on the window lock, and he saidwith a calm smile:            

ìMy dear friend, I have a charmed life in this city. I have been a prisoner inthe Bastille. There is no patriot in Paris or all of France who would touch meknowing I had been a prisoner there, unless it was to embrace me and carry me intriumph. My suffering has given me a power that got us safely through thebarrier. It helped us obtain news of where Charles was and helped get us here. Iknew that would be the case. I knew I could help Charles to safety. I told Lucieso. What is that noise?î His hand was on the window again.             

ìDonít look!î yelled Mr. Lorry, desperately. ìNo, Lucie, my dear, you canítlook either!î He put his arm around her and held her. ìDonít be so afraid. Iswear I havenít heard anything about Charles being harmed. I didnít even suspectthat he was here in Paris. Which prison is he in?î            

ìLa Force!î            

ìLa Force! Lucie, my child, if ever you were brave and helpful in yourlifeóand I know that you have always been bothóyou will pull yourself togetherand do exactly what I tell you. More depends on it than you can think, or I cansay. There is nothing you can do for him tonight, and you cannot go outside. Iímtelling you this because what I have to ask you to do for Charles is the hardestthing to do at all. You have to listen and be calm and quiet. You must go into aroom in the back here. You must leave your father and I alone for two minutes,and you must do it right now. Itís a matter of life and death.î             

ìI will do what you tell me. I see in your face that you know I canít doanything else. I trust you.î            

Mr. Lorry kissed her and brought her quickly into his room. He turned the key,and then he hurried back to the doctor. He opened the window and partly openedthe blinds and put his hand on the doctorís arm. They both looked out into thecourtyard.             

They saw a crowd of men and women. There werenít enough of them to fill thecourtyard. There werenít more than forty or fifty of them in all. The people whohad possession of the house had let them in at the front gate, and they hadrushed in to work at the grindstone. It had apparently been placed there forthis purpose, as it was a convenient spot that was hidden away.             

What awful people doing such awful work!            

The grindstone had a double handle, and two men turned it madly. Their longhair flipped back when the whirling of the grindstone brought their faces up.Their faces were more horrible and cruel than the wildest savages in their mostterrifying costumes. They wore false eyebrows and fake moustaches, and theirugly faces were covered with blood and sweat, and were contorted with howling.They were staring and glaring with excitement and lack of sleep. As they turnedand turned the grindstone, their wet hair flung forward over their eyes, thenbackward over their necks. Some women brought wine to their mouths so they coulddrink, and with the blood and wine and the sparks coming off of the stone, theatmosphere seemed filled with gore and fire. Every person in the group had bloodon him. Shoving past each other to be next at the grinding stone were shirtlessmen who had blood all over their arms and bodies, men in bloody rags, and menwearing stolen bits of womenís lace and silk and ribbon, all stained with blood.Hatchets, knives, bayonets, and swords were all brought to be sharpened and werecovered in blood. Some of the swords were tied to peopleís wrists with strips oflinen and pieces of dresses. They used different things to tie them, but theywere all red with blood. As the people carrying these weapons pulled them out ofthe grindstoneís sparks and ran off into the streets, the same red color couldbe seen in their eyes. Any civilized watcher would have given twenty years ofhis life to kill the owners of those eyes.            

All of this was seen in an instant, as if it were the vision of a drowningman, or the vision of any person seeing the world at a great turning point. Theymoved away from the window and the doctor looked at Mr. Lorryís pale face,hoping he would explain what they had seen.             

ìTheyíre murdering the prisoners,î Mr. Lorry whispered, glancing fearfullyaround the locked room. ìIf youíre sure what you say is true, if you really havethe power you think you haveóas I believe you doógo show yourself to theseviolent people and have them take you to La Force Prison. It may be too lateóIdonít knowóbut go right this minute!î            

Dr. Manette shook Mr. Lorryís hand and rushed out of the room without puttinghis hat on. He was in the courtyard when Mr. Lorry pulled the blinds back againand looked out the window.            

His long white hair, his remarkable face, and his confidence allowed him tomove right to the center of the group near the grindstone. He pushed theirweapons aside as he walked through them, and for a few moments there was apause. Then they started rushing around and talking. The doctor spoke, but Mr.Lorry couldnít hear what he was saying. Mr. Lorry saw him surrounded by all ofthem, in the middle of a line of twenty men. They were all linked shoulder toshoulder or hand to shoulder and were yelling, ìLong live the Bastille prisoner!Help the Bastille prisonerís family in La Force! Make room for the Bastilleprisoner in front there! Save the prisoner Evremonde at La Force!î and thousandsof other responses.             

Mr. Lorry closed the lattice blind again. His heart was beating fast. Heclosed the window and the curtain and rushed to Lucie, and he told her that herfather was being helped by the people and had gone to look for her husband. Hefound her daughter and Miss Pross there with her. It never occurred to him thatseeing them there should have surprised him until much later, when he satwatching them in the relative quiet of the night.             

By that time, Lucie had fallen asleep on the floor at his feet, still holdinghis hand. Miss Pross had laid the child down on Mr. Lorryís bed, where her headhad gradually fallen onto the pillow next to Lucie. Oh, the long, long night,with Lucie crying out for her husband! Oh, the long night, with her father stillgone and no word of how he was doing.            

The bell at the front gate rang twice more during the night. Again a crowd ofpeople rushed in and used the grindstone. ìWhat is it?î cried Lucie, frightened.ìQuiet! They sharpen the soldersí swords there,î said Mr. Lorry. ìThis house isnational property now and is used as a kind of armorya building in which weapons are storedarmory.î            

It happened twice more, but the last time they came the crowd was smaller.Soon afterward, the sun began to come up. Mr. Lorry released himself softly fromLucieís grasp and cautiously looked out the window again. A man was getting upfrom the pavement beside the grindstone. He was so covered with blood that helooked like a badly wounded soldier, regaining consciousness on a battlefieldcovered with dead bodies. He looked around him with an empty stare. Soon theexhausted killer noticed one of the monseigneurís carriages in the weakdaylight. He staggered over to the gorgeous vehicle, climbed into it, shut thedoor, and went to sleep on its dainty cushions.             

It was later in the day when Mr. Lorry looked out the window again. The sunwas shining red on the courtyard, and the grindstone was still standing therealone in the morning air, covered in blood that would never come off.            

The next day, when business hours came around, one of the first things thatoccurred to the business-minded Mr. Lorry was that he had no right to endangerTellsonís Bank by protecting the wife of an emigrant prisoner inside the bank.He would have risked his own belongings, safety, or life for Lucie without asecond thought. But he was putting the bank at risk, not just himself, and asfar as the bank was concerned, he was a strict businessman.             

First, he thought about Defarge. He considered finding the wine shop again andgetting Defargeís advice on the safest place to live in the chaotic city. Butthe same reason that made him want to ask Defarge also made him reject the idea.Defarge lived in the most violent quarter and was certainly deeply involved inwhat was happening there.             

It was almost noon. Since the doctor hadnít returned yet, and since everyminute he was missing was a threat to Tellsonís Bank, Mr. Lorry worked out aplan with Lucie. She said that her father had talked about renting a place tolive for a short period of time in that quarter near the bank. As renting aplace didnít threaten Tellsonís at allóand as they would certainly have to staysome time, since even if Charles were released he wouldnít be allowed toleaveóMr. Lorry went out to look for such a place. He found an acceptable onehigh up in a removed side street, where the closed blinds in all the otherwindows marked the homes as deserted.            

He immediately brought Lucie, her child, and Miss Pross to this apartment. Hegave them as much comfort as he could, and more comfort than he allowed himself.He left Jerry with them to guard the doorway and went back to his own business.He continued to worry about them as the day dragged on.             

The day passed slowly, and tired him out, until the bank finally closed. Onceagain he was alone in his room from the night before. He was thinking about whatto do next when he heard footsteps on the stairs. In a few moments, a man stoodin front of him. The man looked at Mr. Lorry closely and called him byname:            

ìI am your servant,î said Mr. Lorry. ìDo you know me?î            

The man was strong and had dark, curly hair. He was between forty-five andfifty years old. He answered by repeating the words exactly the same way:            

ìDo you know me?î            

ìI have seen you somewhere.î            

ìMaybe at my wine shop?î            

Very interested and excited, Mr. Lorry said, ìYou were sent by Dr.Manette?î            

ìYes. I was sent by Dr. Manette.î            

ìAnd what does he say? What information did he send me?î            

Defarge handed him a scrap of paper. It was written in the doctoríshandwriting:            

ìCharles is safe, but I cannot leave here safely yet. I have convinced them tolet Charles write a short note to Lucie. Let Defarge see Lucie.î            

It was dated from La Force Prison within the past hour.            

ìWill you go with me to see his wife?î said Mr. Lorry, happy and relievedafter reading the note out loud.             

ìYes,î answered Defarge.             

Mr. Lorry had not yet noticed how strangely reserved and mechanical Defargewas when he spoke. Mr. Lorry put on his hat and they went out into thecourtyard. There, they found two women, one of them knitting.            

ìYou are Madame Defarge, of course!î said Mr. Lorry. She had looked exactlythe same as she had seventeen years ago.             

ìIt is she,î said Monsieur Defarge.             

ìIs Madame Defarge going with us?î asked Mr. Lorry, noticing that she wasmoving along with them.            

ìYes. She is going so she can see their faces and recognize them. It is fortheir safety.î            

Mr. Lorry was starting to notice the odd way Defarge was behaving. Mr. Lorrylooked doubtfully at him and led the way, and both of the women followed them.The second woman was The Vengeance.            

They walked through the streets as quickly as they could and climbed thestaircase to the new house. Jerry let them in and they found Lucie crying alone.She was overjoyed by the news Mr. Lorry gave her about Charles, and she graspedDefargeís hand, the one in which he was carrying the note. She didnít realizethat Defarge might have been killing prisoners with those same hands that night,and might have killed Charles if they hadnít been so lucky.             

The note said, ìMy dearest. Be brave. I am doing well, and your father is ableto influence the people here. You cannot answer this letter. Kiss Little Luciefor me.î            

That was all he had written, but it meant so much to Lucie that she turnedfrom Defarge to Madame Defarge and kissed one of her hands. It was a passionate,loving, thankful, womanly thing to do. But Madame Defarge didnít respond at all.She just dropped her hand coldly and went back to knitting.             

There was something about Madame Defargeís touch that made Lucie freeze. Shestopped as she was putting the note in her bosom, and with her hands near herneck, she gave Madame Defarge a terrified look. Madame Defarge looked back ather with a cold, emotionless stare.             

ìMy dear,î said Mr. Lorry, jumping in to explain. ìThere are often uprisingsin the streets. And, although it is unlikely that they will bother you, MadameDefarge wants to come with us so she can see those she might be able to protect,what they look like, to identify them. I believe Iím correct, yes, CitizenDefarge?î said Mr. Lorry. He said these reassuring words rather tentatively, ashe saw the serious manner of Defarge and the women.             

Defarge looked gloomily at his wife. His only answer was a grunt ofagreement.            

ìLucie, youíd better leave your daughter and Miss Pross here,î said Mr. Lorry,doing all he could to appease them. ìMiss Pross is an English lady and doesnítknow any French,î he told Defarge.            

Miss Pross, who strongly believed she could handle any foreigner, wasnítshaken or upset by being in a dangerous situation. She came in with her armscrossed and said in English to The Vengeance, whom she saw first, ìWell, I amsure, Boldface! I hope you are doing well!î She also coughed atMadame Defarge in a British manner. Neither one of them paid much attention toher, though.             

ìIs that Darnayís child?î asked Madame Defarge. She stopped knitting for thefirst time and pointed her knitting needle at Little Lucie as if it were thefinger of Fate.             

ìYes, madame,î answered Mr. Lorry. ìThis is our poor prisonerís darlingdaughter and his only child.î            

The shadow of Madame Defarge and the other two fell on little Lucie in such adark and threatening manner that her mother instinctively knelt down on theground next to her and held her to her chest. The shadow seemed to fall on boththe mother and her child.             

ìThatís enough, husband,î said Madame Defarge. ìI have seen them. We cango.î            

But her behavior was menacing enoughónot in an obvious way, but hiddenótofrighten Lucie. She took Madame Defargeís dress in her hand and said:            

ìYou will be good to my poor husband. You wonít hurt him. You will help me seehim if you can?î            

ìYour husband is not my business here,î answered Madame Defarge, looking downat her calmly. ìIt is you, Dr. Manetteís daughter, that is my concern.î            

ìFor my sake, then, be merciful to my husband. For the sake of my daughter!She will pray that you are merciful to Charles. We are more afraid of you thanwe are of these others.î            

Madame Defarge took it as a compliment and looked at her husband. Defarge, whohad been biting his thumbnail nervously and looking at her, set his face in astern expression.            

ìWhat did your husband say in that little letter?î asked Madame Defarge,smiling. ìInfluence. Something about influence?î            

ìThat my father has a lot of influence on the people around him,î said Lucie.She took the paper quickly from her breast without looking away from MadameDefarge.             

ìSurely his influence will get Charles released!î said Madame Defarge. ìLetit!î            

ìAs a wife and a mother,î cried Lucie sincerely, ìI beg you to take pity onme. Donít use any of your power against my innocent husband, but use it to helphim. Oh, my sister and fellow woman, think of me. I am a wife and amother!î            

Madame Defarge looked as coldly as ever at the pleading woman, and turning toher friend The Vengeance, said:             

ìThe wives and mothers we used to see, since we were as young as your daughterand much younger, have not been thought of. We have seen theirhusbands and fathers sent to prison and kept away from them enough times. Allour lives we have seen our fellow women and their children suffer. They havesuffered from poverty, nakedness, hunger, thirst, sickness, misery, oppression,and neglect of all kinds.î            

ìWeíve seen nothing else,î answered The Vengeance.            

ìWe have endured this for a long time,î said Madame Defarge, looking at Lucieagain. ìJudge you! Is it likely that the suffering of one wife and mother wouldmatter much to us now?î            

Madame Defarge went back to her knitting and left. The Vengeance followed.Monsieur Defarge went out last and closed the door.             

ìBe brave, my dear Lucie,î said Mr. Lorry, picking her up off the ground. ìBebrave! So far, all is going well. Itís going much, much better than it has formany less fortunate people. Cheer up, and be thankful.î            

ìI am not ungrateful, I hope, but that terrible woman has thrown a dark shadowon my hopes.î            

ìTut, tut!î said Mr. Lorry. ìWhy are you so sad? A shadow? Really? But thereis no substance to a shadow, Lucie.î            

But the way the Defarges were acting had thrown a shadow on him too, and whatthey had said secretly bothered him very much.            

Dr. Manette didnít come back until one morning four days later. Lucie was keptfrom knowing so much of what had happened during that terrible period that itwasnít until much later, when she had been away from France for a long time,that she learned eleven hundred defenseless prisonersóboth male and female andof all agesóhad been killed by the people. This horrible deed had gone on forfour days and nights, while the dead bodies had poisoned the air around her. Sheonly knew that there had been an attack on the prisons and that all of thepolitical prisoners had been in danger. She knew that some of them had beendragged out of the prisons by the crowd and killed.             

Swearing Mr. Lorry to secrecy, Dr. Manette informed him that the crowd hadtaken him through the bloodshed in the streets to La Force Prison. There he hadfound a self-appointed tribunala court of justicetribunal holding trials in the prison. The prisoners were broughtin front of the tribunal one-by-one, and the tribunal would quickly decide ifthey should be killed, released, or, in a few cases, brought back to theircells. The people accompanying him had presented Dr. Manette to the tribunal. Hehad told them his name and his profession and that he had spent eighteen yearsas a secret prisoner at the Bastille who had never been officially accused ofanything. One of the tribunal members stood up and identified him. This man wasDefarge.             

Dr. Manette told Mr. Lorry that he had learned from the lists on the tablethat Charles was one of the prisoners who was still alive. Dr. Manette hadbegged the tribunal to let Charles live. Some of the men on the tribunal wereasleep, some were awake, some were covered in blood and some were clean, somewere sober and some were drunk. He told them that the people had granted him theright, as a sufferer under the now-defeated justice system, to have CharlesDarnay brought in front of the tribunal and examined. It seemed that Charles wasabout to be released when his luck came to a stop. The doctor couldnítunderstand why. The members of the tribunal then spoke a few words to each otherin secret. The man acting as president of the tribunal then told Dr. Manettethat the prisoner had to stay in custody, but for the doctorís sake he would bekept safe. Then, on a signal, Charles was taken inside the prison again. Thedoctor had begged for permission to stay and make sure that Charles wasnít,through malice or bad luck, taken out to the violent crowd outside the gate.Their murderous yells often drowned out the court proceedings. Dr. Manette hadbeen allowed to stay and had stayed there in the courtroom until the danger wasover.             

The things he saw there between his brief meals and sleep will remain untold.The intense celebration when a prisoner was saved didnít surprise him any lessthan the intense rage toward those who were sentenced to death and cut topieces. Dr. Manette said one prisoner there had been set free into the street,only to be mistakenly stabbed with a pike as he went out. The crowd begged thedoctor to go tend to his wound, and he had gone out to him from the same gate.He found the man in the arms of a group of volunteers. They were sitting on topof the bodies of people they had killed. They helped the doctor and took care ofthe wounded man with gentle concern. Their helpful behavior was so inconsistentthat it was as disturbing as anything else in that awful nightmare. They made astretcher for him and carried him carefully away, and then they picked up theirweapons again and went back to killing people so terribly that the doctorcovered his eyes with his hands and passed out in the middle of it.             

As Mr. Lorry listened, and as he watched the face of his friend who was nowsixty-two years old, he started to worry that these terrible experiences mightcause a relapse of his old dangerous condition.             

But he had never seen Dr. Manette as he currently was. He had never known himthe way he was now. For the first time, Dr. Manette felt that his suffering inthe Bastille had given him strength and power. For the first time, he felt thatin prison he had slowly gained the strength and skills that would free hisdaughterís husband and bring him to safety. ìIt will all pay off in the end, myfriend,î said Dr. Manette. ìIt wasnít a terrible waste. As my daughter, Lucie,helped me recover, I will help bring her husband back to her. With the help ofHeaven, I will do it!î Jarvis Lorry saw the fire in his eyes and the determinedlook on his face. He had the calm, strong appearance of a man whose life seemedto have been put on hold for so many years, then started up again with an energythat had been hidden until it was now useful. Mr. Lorry believed him.             

The doctor felt determined to such a degree that he could have conqueredgreater obstacles than the ones he now faced. He kept working as a doctor, whosebusiness was with all types of peopleóprisoners and free people, rich and poor,bad and good. He used his influence so well that he was soon the official doctorfor three prisons, including La Force. He could now tell Lucie that her husbandwas no longer imprisoned alone, but was mixed in with the main prisonpopulation. He saw her husband once a week, and he brought messages to her thatCharles spoke to him directly. Sometimes Charles himself wrote a letter to her,though the doctor was never the one who delivered it. Lucie wasnít allowed towrite to him, though, because many suspected that there were plots beingdeveloped in the prisons, especially involving emigrants who had made friends ormet important people abroad.             

The new life of Dr. Manette was very stressful. Still, the wise Mr. Lorry sawthat he took pride in it. Nothing unappealing tainted this pride. It was naturalfor him to be proud, and he deserved it. But Mr. Lorry thought it was strange.Dr, Manette knew that until then, his daughter and Mr. Lorry had associated hisimprisonment with his personal suffering and weakness. Now this had changed. Heknew that his suffering in the Bastille had given him the power to save Charlesand get him back to safety. He was in high spirits about the change. He was aleader now, and his daughter and Mr. Lorry were the weak ones trusting in hisstrength. The relationship between Lucie and him had been reversed. But only theway the most intense gratitude and affection could reverse them. He couldníthave taken any pride in anything but helping her in some way after she hadhelped him so much. ìItís strange to see,î thought Mr. Lorry in his friendly andsmart way, ìbut it is right. So, take the lead, my dear friend, and stay incharge. We couldnít be in better hands.î            

The doctor never stopped trying to get Charles set free or at least brought totrial, but the public opinion of the time was too strong for him to fightagainst. The new era had begun. The king was tried, convicted, and had his headcut off. The Republic of ìLiberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Deathî was ready tobe victorious and kill anyone who was against them. A black flag flew day andnight from the tall towers of Notre Dame. Three hundred thousand men rose upagainst their oppressors. They rose up all over France, as if they were growingout of the earth. They came from hills and plains, rock, gravel, and mud. Theycame from the South and the North, from fields and forests, from vineyards andolive fields. They came from the trimmed grass, cornfields, the lush farmlandnear the rivers, and the sandy beaches. What single person could compete withthe storm rising during the first year after of the Revolution? This storm wascoming up from the ground instead of falling from the sky. Instead of a stormfalling from Heaven, Heaven wanted nothing to do with this storm.             

The violence didnít stop, let up, or quiet down. People lost track of time.Days and nights blended together. It was like the beginning of time when therewere only the morning and night of the first day and no other time existed. Thefurious people of France lost track of time the way a fever patient does. Now,breaking the cityís unnatural silence, the executioner cut off the head of theking and showed it to the people. Almost immediately after he showed them thehead of his wife, the queen. She had spent eight months suffering in prisonafter her husband died, turning her hair gray.             

But because such times bring contradictions with them, the time felt long,though it moved so quickly. There was a revolutionary tribunal set up in thecapital. There were also forty or fifty thousand revolutionary committees allover the country. These committees enacted a Law of the Suspected, which removedany assurance of freedom or safety and allowed any good, innocent person to beaccused by any bad, guilty one. The prisons filled up with innocent people whocouldnít get their cases heard. These things became the established order andseemed to have been around since ancient times before they were even a few weeksold. Above all, the guillotine grew so familiar to everyone that it seemed likeit had been around since the beginning of the world.             

It was popular in jokes. People joked that it was the best cure for aheadache, that it always kept the hair from turning gray, that it refined thecomplexion. It was the National Razor that gave you a close shave. People jokedthat you kissed the guillotine, looked through the little window, and sneezedinto the sack. It was a sign of the rebirth of the human race and took the placeof the Christian cross. Models of the guillotine were worn on necklaces thatused to have crosses on them. People now bowed down and worshipped theguillotine and rejected the cross.             

It cut off so many heads that it was stained red along with the groundunderneath it. It was taken apart and put together again when it was needed,like a puzzle for a terrible young child. It silenced those who spoke well,knocked down those who were powerful, and eliminated those who were beautifuland good. It had cut off the heads of twenty-two respectable peopleótwenty-oneof them were alive and one was already deadówithin twenty-two minutes on onemorning. The executioner who operated it had been nicknamed Samson after thestrong man of the Old Testament. But with the guillotine, he was stronger thanSamson, and more blind, and he tore down the gates of Godís own temple everyday.             

Dr. Manette moved through these dangers and among the dangerous people with aclear head. He was confident and remained cautiously persistent. He neverdoubted that he would eventually save Charles Darnay. Yet, time passed soquickly that Charles had now been in prison for a year and three months. ThatDecember, the Revolution had grown so much more violent and out of control thatthe rivers in the south of France were filled with bodies of people who had beendrowned at night, and prisoners were shot in groups in broad daylight. Still,Dr. Manette viewed all these terrors with a clear head. There was no one as wellknown in Paris at the time and no one in a stranger situation. He was quiet,kind, and essential in the hospitals and prisons, and he treated killers andvictims the same. He was neutral, and when he was treating patients, the factthat he had once been a prisoner in the Bastille set him apart from everyoneelse. He was not suspected or questioned any more than he would have been if hereally had been brought back to life eighteen years earlier and was a ghostwandering among the living.             

Charles had been in prison for one year and three months. During that time,Lucie never knew from one hour to the next if the guillotine would cut off hishead the next day. Every day, carts filled with condemned prisoners rumbledthrough the streets. Beautiful girls; attractive women with brown, black, orgray hair; young men and women; sturdy old men; nobles and peasants all went tobleed at the guillotine. Every day they were brought from the dark cellars ofthe prisons to the light of the outdoors and brought through the streets tosatisfy the guillotineís thirst. Of the Revolutionís slogan, ìLiberty, Equality,Fraternity, or Death,î the last one, ìdeath,î was the easiest to impart. Oguillotine!             

If the suddenness of Lucieís misfortune, and the chaos of the time, hadstunned her into waiting for Charlesís release in idle despair, she would havebeen like many others in her situation. But since she had first found her fatherin the attic in Saint Antoine, she had always been committed to herresponsibilities. She was even more committed now, as all who are quietly loyaland good always are.             

As soon as they settled into their new house and Dr. Manette had fallen intohis routine of treating patients, she arranged the little household just as ifher husband had been there. Everything had its place and time, and she taughtLittle Lucie as regularly as if they had all been together in their home inLondon. To trick herself into believing she and Charles would soon be reunited,she used little devices, such as the preparations made for his quick return, andthe fact that his chair and books were set aside waiting for him. These devices,and the prayer she said at night for all the poor people who were in prison andin danger, especially Charles, were the only things that relieved her worriedmind.             

Her appearance did not change much. The plain, dark dresses that she andlittle Lucie wore looked like mourning dresses, but they were as neat and welltreated as the brighter clothes they wore during happier times. She was palernow, and the old, intense expression on her forehead was constantly on her face,not an occasional thing anymore. Otherwise, she still looked very attractive.Sometimes, at night when she kissed her father, she would burst into tears afterhaving hidden her feelings all day. She would tell him that he was the onlything on earth she could depend on. He always answered determinedly, ìNothingcan happen to Charles without my knowing about it, and I know that I can savehim, Lucie.î             

They had only been living this new life of theirs for a few weeks when, uponcoming home one night, her father said to her:             

ìMy dear, there is a window high up in the prison that Charles can sometimeslook out of at three in the afternoon. When he can get to itówhich depends onmany uncertain thingsóhe thinks he might be able to see you in the street if youstood in a specific place. Iíll show you where it is. But you will not be ableto see him. And even if you could, it wouldnít be safe for you to make any signsor gestures to each other.î            

ìOh, show me the place, Father, and I will go there every day.î            

From that point on she waited there for two hours every day, no matter whatthe weather was. When the clock struck two she would be there, and at fouroíclock she would walk away resignedly. When the weather allowed she would bringLucie with her, and at other times she would go alone. But she never missed asingle day.             

The place where she would stand was a dark and dirty corner of a small,winding street. The small hut of a wood sawyera person who saws wood for a livingwood sawyer, who sawed logs into pieces forfirewood, was the only house at that end of the street. The rest of the streetwas enclosed by walls. On the third day Lucie was there, the wood sawyer noticedher.             

ìGood day, citizeness.î            

ìGood day, citizen.î            

This way of addressing people was now required by law. It had started assomething the more passionate patriots did by choice some time ago, but noweveryone was required to do it.             

ìI see youíre walking here again, citizeness?î            

ìYou see that I am, citizen!î            

The wood sawyer was a little man who gestured too much. He had once been arepairer of roads. He looked at the prison and pointed to it. He put his tenfingers in front of his face to represent prison bars and peeked through themplayfully.             

ìBut itís none of my business,î he said, going back to sawing wood.             

The next day he was waiting for her and approached her as soon as sheappeared.             

ìWhat? Youíre walking here again, citizeness?î            

ìYes, citizen.î            

ìAh! And you brought a child too! This is your mother, isnít it, my littlecitizeness?î             

ìShould I say yes, Mamma?î little Lucie whispered to her mother, pulling closeto her.             

ìYes, dearest,î said Lucie.             

ìYes, citizen,î little Lucie said to the wood sawyer.            

ìAh! But itís none of my business. My work is my business. Look at my saw! Icall it my little guillotine. La la la, la la la! And off goes his head!î            

Part of the piece of the wood fell off as he spoke, and he threw it into abasket.             

ìI call myself the Samson of the firewood guillotine. Look again!î He sang ashe cut another piece of wood. ìLoo loo loo, loo loo loo! And off goes    her head! Now Iíll do a child. Tickle, tickle, pickle,pickle! And off goes the childís head. A whole family!î            

Lucie shuddered as he threw two more pieces of wood into his basket, but itwas impossible to be there while the wood sawyer was working nearby without himseeing her. Therefore, to keep him happy, she always spoke to him first. Oftenshe would give him money for drinks, which he took happily.             

He was a curious man. Sometimes when she had completely forgotten about himand was looking at the prison roof and grates thinking of her husband, she wouldrealize that the wood sawyer was looking at her. His knee would be on his benchand his saw would have stopped moving. ìBut itís none of my business!î he wouldusually say when this happened, and then he would quickly go back to work again.        

No matter what the weather was, Lucie spent two hours of every day at thisplace. In the snow and frost during winter, the strong winds during spring, thehot sunshine of summer, or the rains of autumn, Lucie would be there. Then shewould be back again in the snow and frost of winter. Every day when she left shewould kiss the prison wall. Her father told her that her husband only saw heronce every five or six times she went. Sometimes it was two or three times in arow. Sometimes it wasnít for a week or two. It was enough that he saw her whenhe got the chance. If there were even a chance of him seeing her, she would havespent the whole day there seven days a week.             

She continued to do this until December. Meanwhile, her father moved among allthe terrible events happening with a cool head. One afternoon, when it wassnowing lightly, Lucie arrived at her usual corner. It was a day when peoplewere celebrating and there was a festival. As she walked through the streets shenoticed that the houses were decorated with little pikes that had little redcaps stuck on them. They were also decorated with three-colored ribbons, and hadthe standard slogan of the Republic (many in three-colored letters), ìOne andIndivisible. Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death!î             

The wood sawyerís gloomy little shop was so small that this slogan hardly fiton it. He had gotten somebody to write it for him who had barely been able tosqueeze in the word death. On his rooftop he had placed a capon a pike, as all good citizens were expected to do, and he had placed his sawin one window with the words ìLittle Saint Guillotineî written on it, for nowpeople referred to the guillotine as ìSaint Guillotine.î His shop was closed andhe wasnít there, and Lucie was relieved to be left alone.             

But the wood sawyer wasnít far away. Soon Lucie heard people hurrying towardher and shouting, and she was frightened. A moment later a crowd of people camerushing around the corner by the prison wall. The wood sawyer was in the middleof them, hand-in-hand with the woman known as The Vengeance. There were at leastfive hundred people there, and they were dancing like five thousand devils.Their own singing was their only music. They danced to the popular song of theRevolution, and the way they kept in time sounded like they were all gnashingtheir teeth in unison. Men and women danced together. Women danced with women,men danced with men, and people danced with whomever they ended up close to. Atfirst the crowd was made up of red caps and rough wool rags, but as they filledthe street and started dancing around Lucie, a terrible, ghostlike figurestarted dancing above them. They moved forward, then back, and they slapped eachotherís hands and grabbed each otherís heads. They spun around by themselves orcaught each other and spun around in pairs. They did this until many of themdropped to the ground. While those people were on the ground, the rest of themjoined hands and all spun around together, and then the ring broke and theyformed separate rings of two and four people. They spun and spun until they allstopped at the same time. Then they started up again, hit each other, grabbed ateach other, tore at each other, and then started spinning in the oppositedirection. Suddenly they stopped again. They paused and started anew, forminginto lines that were as wide as the street. Then they ran off screaming withtheir heads bowed low and their hands high in the air. No fight could have beenhalf as terrifying as this dance was. It was so much like an evilsportósomething that had once been innocent that was now evilóa healthy pastimethat had been changed into something used to excite people and incite them toviolence. The parts of it that looked graceful made it even more ugly as itshowed how all good things had turned perverse and terrible. The young maidenísbosom, or the pretty young girlís head, or the delicate foot involved in thisterrible dance were the types of things that marked this disjointed time.            

The dance was called the Carmagnole. As it passed, leaving Lucie frightenedand confused in the doorway of the wood-sawyerís house, the snow fell quietly.It lied white and soft on the ground as if the dance had never happened.             

Lucie had covered her eyes with her hand for a moment, and when she looked upDr. Manette stood before her. ìOh, Father! This was a cruel, terrible sight tosee.î            

ìI know, my dear. I know. I have seen it many times. Donít be frightened! Noneof them would ever hurt you.î            

ìIím not frightened for myself, Father, but when I think of Charles, and thesemerciless peopleóî            

ìWe will get him safely away from these people soon. When I left he wasclimbing to the window. I came to tell you. You werenít here for him to see.Blow a kiss toward that roof at the top.î            

ìIíll do it, Father, and I send him my soul with it.î            

ìYou canít see him, my poor dear?î            

ìNo, Father,î said Lucie. She was crying longingly as she kissed her hand.ìNo.î            

They heard footsteps in the snow. It was Madame Defarge. Dr. Manette greetedher. ìI salute you, citizeness,î he said. She answered, ìI salute you, citizen.îShe said it as she passed, and she said nothing more. Then she was gone, like ashadow over the snow-covered street.            

ìGive me your arm, my love. Leave here looking cheerful and brave for yourhusbandís sake. That is the best thing you can do.î They left the spot. ìAll ofthis wonít be for nothing. Charles is going before the court tomorrow.î            

ìTomorrow!î            

ìThere is no time to lose. I am well prepared, but we need to takeprecautions. These steps could not be taken until he was actually summonedbefore the tribunal. He hasnít received the notice yet, but I know that he willsoon be summoned for tomorrow and taken to the Conciergeriea former palace and prison in Paris where prisoners were triedConciergerie. I have recent information.Youíre not afraid, are you?î            

She almost couldnít answer. ìI trust you.î            

ìYou must trust me completely. Your waiting is almost over, my darling. Hewill be returned to you within a few hours. I have done everything I can toprotect him, and now I must see Mr. Lorry.î            

He stopped. There was the sound of heavy wheels nearby. They both knew toowell what the sound meant. They counted: one, two, three. Three carts bringingprisoners to the guillotine, moving over the snow.            

ìI must see Mr. Lorry,î repeated the doctor, turning the other way.             

Mr. Lorry was still at the bank. He had never left it. He and his records werein frequent demand regarding property that had been taken away from its ownersand given to the state. He saved what he could for the owners. There was nobetter man alive to be trusted to take care of Tellsonís property, and to keepquiet.            

The sky turned a murky red and yellow, and a mist rose up from the SeineRiver. Night was coming, and it was almost dark when they arrived at TellsonísBank. The elegant former home of the monseigneur was wrecked and empty. Above apile of dust and ashes in the courtyard was a sign that said ìNational Property.Republic One and Indivisible. Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death!î            

Someone was with Mr. Lorry who Dr. Manette couldnít see. Who was it? Hisriding coat was on the chair. Who had he been talking to when Mr. Lorry cameout, nervous and surprised, to embrace Dr. Manette? To whom did he repeatLucieís words when he raised his voice, turned toward the door of the room hehad just come from, and said, ìHeís been taken to the Conciergerie and goes ontrial tomorrow.î            

The dreaded tribunal was made up of five judges, a public prosecutor, and aselected jury. The court was in session every day, and their lists were sent outevery night. The jailers in the various prisons read the lists out loud to theirprisoners. They would often make a joke of it and say, ìCome out and listen tothe evening paper, you prisoners!î            

ìCharles Evremonde, also known as Darnay!î            

This is how the ìevening paperî began at La Force Prison.            

When someoneís name was called, the person would step forward into an areareserved for him. Charles Evremonde, also known as Darnay, already knew this. Hehad seen hundred of people go to their deaths this way.             

The swollen jailer, who wore reading glasses, glanced over them to make sureDarnay had stepped forward, and then went through the rest of the list. He wouldpause briefly after each name to make sure the person stepped forward. Therewere twenty-three names, but only twenty people answered. One of the prisonerswhose names was called had already died in jail and been forgotten. Two hadalready been sent to the guillotine and also forgotten. The jailer read the listin the hall with the vaulted ceilings where Darnay had seen the group ofprisoners the night he arrived in prison. Every one of those prisoners had diedin the massacre. Every person he had since cared about in prison had died at theguillotine.             

People quickly said goodbyes and kind words to those whose names were called,but this was over soon. This happened every day, and the prisoners of La ForcePrison were busy preparing for some games and a concert that night. They crowdedtoward the prison grates and cried there, but twenty people in the games andconcert now had to be replaced. Soon they would be locked up and guard dogswould be patrolling the common rooms and hallways during the night. Theprisoners werenít unsympathetic or heartless. Their behavior came from theconditions in which they lived. In a similar way, though with a subtledifference, a type of excitement or intoxication was known to have led somepeople to die at the guillotine unnecessarily. It wasnít simply boastfulness. Itwas as if the public were all infected and had gone mad. When there is a plaguesome people will be secretly attracted to the disease and will want to die ofit. All of us have similar strange desires in our hearts that are only waitingfor the right circumstances to reveal themselves.             

The passageway to the Conciergerie was short and dark. The night was cold andpassed slowly in the rat-infested cells. The next day, fifteen prisoners werebrought in front of the tribunal before Charles Darnayís name was called. Allfifteen were sentenced to death. The trials of all of them together only took anhour and a half.             

ìCharles Evremonde, also known as Darnay,î was finally brought before thecourt.             

The presiding judges wore feathered hats, but the rough red cap andthree-colored cockade of the Revolution was what most other people wore. Lookingat the jury and the rowdy audience, it seemed that the usual order of things hadbeen reversed. It looked like the criminals were trying the honest men. Thelowest, meanest, worst peopleóof a city filled with low, mean, bad peopleówerein charge. The crowd was commenting loudly, applauding, talking amongstthemselves, and influencing the outcome of the trial nonstop. Most of the menwere armed in one way or another, and some of the women had knives or daggers onthem. Some of them ate and drank as they watched, and many of them knitted.Among the women knitting, there was one woman who had a spare piece of knittingunder her arm as she worked. She was in the front row next to a man whom Darnayhadnít seen since he first arrived at the barrier into Paris. He remembered thatthe man was Defarge. Darnay noticed that the woman had whispered in his ear onceor twice and that she seemed to be his wife. But what he noticed most about thetwo of them was that, although they were as close to him as someone could get,they never looked at him. They seemed to be waiting for something intently. Theylooked at the jury, but they didnít look anywhere else. Dr. Manette sat next tothe president of the tribunal, dressed modestly as usual. As far as Darnay couldtell, Dr. Manette and Mr. Lorry were the only men there who werenít part of thetribunal. They wore their usual clothes and were not wearing the Revolutionarycostume of the red cap and three colors.            

The public prosecutor accused Charles Evremonde, also known as Darnay, ofbeing an emigrant. The prosecutor said that Darnayís life belonged to theRepublic of France under the decree that banished all emigrants on pain ofdeath. It didnít matter that the decree was announced after he had returned toFrance. All that mattered was that Darnay was here in France and this is whatthe decree said. He had been captured in France and therefore had to have hishead cut off.             

ìCut off his head!î yelled the crowd. ìHe is an enemy of the Republic!î            

The president rang his bell to silence the crowd and asked the prisoner if itwas true that he had lived in England for many years.            

Darnay said it was true.            

The president asked if that made him an emigrant, and if not, what then did hecall himself.            

Darnay said he was not an emigrant, he hoped, as the law defines it.            

The president asked why not.             

He said because he had given up his title by choice. He didnít want it, or theposition as a marquis. He left France to make his own living in England ratherthan live off the work of the overworked people of France.            

The president asked him what proof he had of this.            

Darnay handed them the names of two witnesses: Theophile Gabelle and AlexandreManette.             

The president reminded him that he had married in England.            

Darnay said it was true, but he hadnít married an English woman.            

The president asked if the woman was French.            

He said yes, that she was French by birth.            

The president asked her name and who her family was.            

Darnay answered that her name is Lucie Manette. She is the only daughter ofDr. Manette, the good doctor who is sitting here.            

The crowd was pleased by this answer, and they cheered Dr. Manette, who waswell known as a good doctor. The crowd was so fickle that several ferociousindividuals, who had been glaring at Darnay a moment before as if they wanted todrag him out into the street and kill him, were now crying for him.             

Dr. Manette had instructed Charles Darnay to say these things, hoping theywould help get him released. The doctor had also instructed him on everythingDarnay needed to do next.             

The president asked why he had returned to France when he did, and notsooner.            

Darnay said he did not return sooner simply because he had no way of making aliving in France except by the ways he had given up. In England he made a livingby teaching French and French literature. He returned when he did afterreceiving an urgent letter from a French citizen, who told Darnay that hisabsence had put the citizenís life in danger. He came back to save a Frenchcitizenís life and to face the truth, whatever personal danger it placed him in.He asked if that were a crime in the eyes of the Republic.             

The crowd yelled enthusiastically, ìNo!î The president rang his bell to quietthem. It didnít quiet them, though, for they continued to yell ìNo!î until theyquieted down on their own.             

The president asked the name of that citizen. Darnay explained that thecitizen was his first witness. He also referred to the citizenís letter andexplained that the letter had been taken from him at the barrier into Paris, butthat he believed it was likely there in the papers that the president had infront of him.             

The doctor had made sure that the letter was there. He had assured Darnay thatit would definitely be there. Now it was taken out and read, and they calledCitizen Gabelle to the stand to confirm the letter. He did so. Citizen Gabellehinted delicately and politely that since the tribunal was so busy dealing withthe many enemies of the Republic, he had been overlooked in Abbaye Prison. Infact, the tribunal had forgotten him entirely until three days ago, when he hadbeen called in front of the court. The jury had released him when they decidedthat his accusation had been resolved when citizen Evremonde, also known asDarnay, had been captured.             

Dr. Manette was questioned next. His popularity and his clear answers made agood impression on the court, but he continued on and told the court that Darnaywas the first friend he made after he was freed from his long prison term andthat Darnay had stayed in England. He told them that Darnay had always stayedfaithful and devoted to Lucie and himself while they were in England. He toldthem that he was so far from being sympathetic with the aristocratic governmentof England that he was actually put on trial for his life by it as a foe ofEngland and a friend of the United States. After Dr. Manette had presented thesecircumstances, discretely and straightforwardly, the jury and the crowd allagreed. Finally, when he appealed to Mr. Lorry, an English gentleman who wasthere in the courtroom, who, like himself, had witnessed that trial in Englandand could confirm his story about it, the jury declared that they had heardenough and that they were ready to vote if the president were ready to hearthem.             

The men on the jury voted aloud one at a time. Every time one of themannounced his vote the crowd would shout and applaud. All of them voted in favorof the prisoner, and the president declared that Darnay was free.             

Then the crowd started to act in a way that satisfied their fickleness andtheir desire to be generous and merciful. Or perhaps it was a way to balancetheir anger and violence. Itís impossible to tell what motivated this behavior.It was probably a combination of all three, but the urge to be generous andmerciful. As soon as Darnay was acquitted, people started crying. So many menand women embraced Darnay that he was in danger of fainting from exhaustion. Itwas just as disturbing to him since he knew very well that those same peoplecould have been rushing at him with the same intensity to tear him to pieces andspread his body over the streets.             

He was rescued from these embraces when he was removed to make room for otherprisoners who were to be put on trial. Five people were going to be triedtogether next. They were accused of being enemies of the Republic because theyhad not said or done anything to help the Revolution. The tribunal acted soquickly to make up for the fact that they didnít get to kill Darnay that thesefive were sentenced to death before Darnay had left. They were sentenced to diewithin the next twenty-four hours. The first of the five prisoners told Darnayby showing him a raised finger, which was the sign used in prison to signifydeath. All five of them added, ìLong live the Republic!î            

There had been no audience in the court to drag out the proceedings for thefive prisoners. When Dr. Manette came out of the gate, there was a large crowdaround it. It seemed to him that everyone that he had seen in the courtroom wasthere, except for Monsieur and Madame Defarge. He couldnít find them anywhere.When he came out, the crowd charged at him all over again. They kept crying,embracing him, and shouting, all alone or all together until the people, whowere standing on a riverbank, all seemed to be as mad as the rushing water inthe river.            

They put Darnay into a large chair, which was either taken from the courtroomor from one of the courtís rooms or hallways. They had thrown a red flag over itand had tied a pike with a red cap on top to the back of the chair. Ignoring thedoctorís pleas, they carried Darnay home on their shoulders. The crowd, withtheir worn faces and red caps, made Darnay think more than once that he wasconfused and that he was actually in a cart on his way to be executed at theguillotine.             

They carried him through the streets, embracing people along the way andpointing Darnay out to them. It was like a wild, dreamlike parade. They turnedthe snow red with their Republican colors, juast as they had reddened the snowwith blood. They carried Darnay into the courtyard of the building where helived. Dr. Manette had gone ahead to prepare Lucie, and when Darnay got off ofthe chair and stood on his own feet, Lucie fainted in his arms.             

He held her to his chest and turned her beautiful face toward him so that hecould kiss her unseen. He kissed her, crying. A few people in the crowd startedto dance. Instantly, the rest of the crowd started dancing. The courtyard wasfilled with people dancing the Carmagnole. Then they picked up a young womanfrom the crowd and carried her around like she was the goddess of liberty. Thecrowd flowed out into the nearby streets, along the riverbank, and over thebridge, dancing the Carmagnole.             

Darnay shook Dr. Manetteís hand as he stood there, victorious and proud infront of them. He shook Mr. Lorryís hand when Mr. Lorry came in panting afterfighting his way through the Carmagnole. He kissed little Lucie, who was liftedup by Miss Pross so she could put her arms around his neck. He embraced MissPross, who was always excited and faithful to them. Then he took Lucie in hisarms and carried her up to their rooms.             

ìLucie! My love! I am safe.î            

ìOh, dearest Charles, let me thank God for this on my knees the way I havebeen praying to Him.î            

They all bowed their heads in prayer. When she was in Darnayís arms again, hesaid to her:            

ìAnd now speak to your father, my dear. No other man in all of France couldhave done what he has done for me.î            

She laid her head on her fatherís chest the way she had laid his head on herchest long ago in the attic in Saint Antoine. He was happy that he could repayher for all sheíd done. He felt paid back for all his suffering, and he wasproud of his strength. ìYou mustnít be weak, darling,î he told her. ìDoníttremble like that. I have saved him.î            

ìI have saved him,î he heard Dr. Manette say. He'd had dreams in which he hadbeen released, but this wasn't a dream. He was really here. But still Lucietrembled, and was very afraid something else might happen.             

The air around them was thick and dark. The people were so desperate forrevenge and unpredictable that innocent people were constantly executed on vaguesuspicions or out of pure hatred. Lucie found it impossible to forget thatpeople as innocent as her husband and just as loved by others were killedeveryday. Her husband had been saved, but still she could not feel as relievedby his release as she should have. It was getting late in the wintry afternoon,and the carts carrying people to the guillotine were rolling through thestreets. Lucie thought about those people, imagining Charles in one of thosecarts among those condemned to die. She clung to him closer and trembledmore.            

Her father tried to cheer her up. He showed compassion and strength, comparedto Lucieís weakness, that was wonderful to see. No attic and no shoemaking now!He wasnít prisoner One Hundred and Five, North Tower, now! He had achieved whathe set out to achieve. He had fulfilled his promise to save Charles, and showedthey could all depend on him.            

They lived a thrifty lifestyle, not only because it was the safest way to liveand would not offend the common people, but because they were not rich. WhileCharles was in prison, he'd had to pay a great sum of money for his bad food andfor his guard, and fore the care of the poorer prisoners. Partly for thisreason, and partly because they didnít want someone spying on their daily lives,the Manettes didnít have any servants. The citizen and citizenesses who servedas porters at the courtyard gate ran errands for them occasionally, and Mr.Lorry had almost entirely passed Jerry onto them now. He was on call for themevery day and he slept there every night.             

It was a law of the Republic, ìOne and Indivisible of Liberty, Equality,Fraternity, or Death,î that the names of every person living in a house bewritten on the door or doorpost. The sign had to be written in letters of acertain size and at a certain height from the ground. Mr. Jerry Cruncherís name,therefore, was written on the doorpost down at the bottom. As it grew later inthe day and the shadows deepened, Mr. Cruncher himself arrived. He had beenoverseeing a painter whom Dr. Manette had hired to add ìCharles Evremonde, alsoknown as Darnay,î to the list of names on the door.             

Fear and distrust existed everywhere at that time, and all of the usualinnocent ways of life had changed. In Dr. Manetteís household, as in manyothers, food and supplies for the day were bought every evening in small amountsfrom different small shops. Everyone did their best to avoid attractingattention. Everyone wanted to avoid talking to others or making other peopleenvious.             

For several months now, Miss Pross and Mr. Cruncher had been in charge ofgetting supplies. Miss Pross would carry the money and Jerry would carry thebasket. They would go out shopping every afternoon around the time when thestreetlamps were lit, and they would buy and bring home whatever they needed.Miss Pross could have known as much French as English by now if she'd wanted,having lived with a French family for a long time, but she had no desire to.Therefore, she knew no more of that French ìnonsenseî (as she liked calling it)than Jerry did. So her way of shopping was to just say the name of what shewanted without any other conversation. If it didnít happen to be the right word,she would look around for the thing she wanted, grab it, and hold onto it untilshe had paid for it. She always bargained the price down by holding up onefinger less than the number the shopkeeper held up.             

ìNow, Mr. Cruncher,î said Miss Pross, her eyes red from crying tears of joy,ìI am ready if you are.î            

Jerry told Miss Pross in his hoarse voice that he was ready. He had worn allof the rust off of his fingers a long time ago, but he still had spikedhair.            

ìWe need all sorts of things,î said Miss Pross. ìAnd we will have a hard timegetting them. We need wine along with everything else. These patriots in theirred caps will be toasting and celebrating wherever we buy it.î            

ìIt will all be the same to you, miss, if they toast to your health or to theOld Oneís,î answered Jerry.             

ìWhoís he?î asked Miss Pross.            

ìMr. Cruncher, with some hesitancy, explained that he meant the devil.            

ìHa!î said Miss Pross. ìYou donít need an interpreter to explain what thesepeople mean. It's always darkness, murder, and mischief.î            

ìQuiet! Please, please be careful what you say!î cried Lucie.             

ìYes, yes, yes, Iíll be cautious,î said Miss Pross. ìBut I can say privatelythat I hope there arenít peasants smelling of onions and tobacco embracing eachother everywhere in the streets. Now, Lucie, donít move from that fire until Icome back! Take care of the dear husband who has returned to you, and keep yourpretty head on his shoulder, like it is now, until I get back. May I ask aquestion, Dr. Manette, before I go?î            

ìI think you can take that liberty,î the doctor answered, smiling.             

ìFor goodness sake, donít talk about liberty. We have quite enough of that,îsaid Miss Pross.            

ìQuiet! Again?î Lucie protested.            

ìWell, my sweet,î said Miss Pross, nodding her head vigorously. ìTo make along story short, I am British and a subject of His Most Gracious Majesty KingGeorge the Third.î Miss Pross curtseyed when she said the name. ìI say 'Confound their politics, Frustrate their knavish tricks, On him our hopes we fix, God save the King!'îlines from the song ìGod Save the King,î the national anthem of the United Kingdom'Confound their politics, Frustrate their knavish tricks, On him our hopes we fix, God save the King!'î.            

Mr. Cruncher, being excessively patriotic, repeated the words in his hoarsevoice as if he were at church.            

ìI am glad that you take so much pride in being an Englishman, although I wishyou had never caught that cold that makes your voice so hoarse,î said Miss Prossapprovingly. ìBut the question is, Dr. Manette, is there any hope yet of usgetting out of Paris?î Miss Pross had a way of talking about serious matters asif they werenít serious at all. She would mention them casually, as if they justhappened to come up in conversation.             

ìNot yet, Iím afraid. It would still be dangerous for Charles.î            

ìHey-ho-hum!î said Miss Pross, cheerfully suppressing a sigh as she looked atLucieís blond hair in the light of the fire. ìThen we must be patient and wait.Thatís all we can do. We must hold our heads up and fight, as my brother,Solomon, used to say. Letís go now, Mr. Cruncher! Stay here and donít move,Lucie!î            

They went out, leaving Lucie, Charles, the doctor, and little Lucie by abright fire. Mr. Lorry was expected to return soon from Tellsonís Bank. MissPross had lit a lamp but had put it aside in a corner so that they could enjoythe light of the fire. Little Lucie sat by the doctor with her hands through hisarm. The doctor, speaking in a tone just above a whisper, began to tell her astory about a great and powerful fairy. The fairy had opened a prison wall andrescued a prisoner who had once done the fairy a favor. Everything was calm andquiet, and Lucie was calmer than she had been before.             

ìWhatís that?î she yelled out suddenly.            

ìMy dear!î said the doctor, stopping his story and taking her hand. ìGet ahold of yourself. Youíre so anxious! The smallest thing, even nothing, startlesyou! You, your fatherís daughter!î            

ìFather, I thought I heard strangers coming up the stairs,î said Lucie,explaining herself. Her face was pale and her voice quavered.            

ìLucie, the staircase is as quiet as death.î As he said the last word, someoneknocked on the door.            

ìOh, Father, Father! Who can this be? Hide Charles. Save him!î            

ìMy child,î said the doctor, getting up and putting his hand on her shoulder.ìI have saved him. How weak you are, my dear! Let me go to thedoor.î            

He picked up the lamp, walked through the two outer rooms, and opened thedoor. He heard the sound of footsteps hurrying over the floor, and four roughmen in red caps entered the room with sabers and pistols.             

ìWeíre looking for the Citizen Evremonde, also known as Darnay,î said thefirst man.             

ìWhoís looking for him?            

ìIím looking for him. Weíre all looking for him. I know you, Evremonde. I sawyou brought before the tribunal today. You are again a prisoner of theRepublic.î            

The four men surrounded Charles, who stood where he was with Lucie and theirdaughter clinging to him.             

ìTell me why I am a prisoner again?î            

ìItís enough for you to know that you are to be taken straight back to theConciergerie. They will tell you why tomorrow when you are summoned before thetribunal again.î            

Dr. Manette was frozen as if he had been turned to stone, and he stood holdingthe lamp as if he were a statue that was made to hold it. He moved after the manspoke these words and put down the lamp. He confronted the man, firmly grabbingthe loose front of his red woolen shirt, and said:            

ìYou say you know Charles Darnay. Do you know me?î            

ìYes, I know you, Citizen Doctor.î            

ìWe all know you, Citizen Doctor,î said the other three men.             

The doctor looked confusedly from one man to another. After a pause he loweredhis voice and said:            

ìWill you answer Charles's questions for me then? Why is thishappening?î            

ìCitizen Doctor,î said the first, reluctantly, ìhe has been accused by thepeople of Saint Antoine. This citizen is from Saint Antoine.î He pointed out thesecond man who had come in with them.             

The second man nodded his head and added:            

ìHe has been accused by the people of Saint Antoine.î            

ìAccused of what?î            

ìDonít ask any more questions,î said the first man reluctantly. ìIf theRepublic needs you to make sacrifices, then Iím sure you, as a good patriot,will be happy to make them. The Republic is more important than anything else.The people come first. Evremonde, letís go. We are in a hurry.î            

ìOne more thing,î the doctor asked. ìWill you tell me who accused him?î            

ìItís against the rules for me to tell you,î answered the first man. ìBut youcan ask the man from Saint Antoine here.î            

The doctor turned and looked at the man. The man shifted uneasily on his feetand rubbed his beard a little. After a while he said:            

ìWell! It really is against the rules, but he has been accusedóandseriouslyóby Monsieur and Madame Defarge. And by one other person.î            

ìWho was the other person?î            

ìAre you asking me, Citizen Doctor?î            

ìYes.î            

ìThen you will get your answer tomorrow,î said the man from Saint Antoine witha strange look. ìFor now, I say no more!î            

Happily unaware that Charles was being taken back to prison, Miss Pross madeher way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the Pont-Neuf bridge.She thought about the number of essential items she needed to buy. Mr. Cruncherwalked beside her carrying the basket, and they both looked to the right andleft into the shops they walked by. They kept an eye out for excited groups ofpeople. If they saw any, they would leave the road to avoid them. It was a coldevening. The misty river was blurred with the reflection of blazing lights andits sound drowned out by the noise of the barges, where the smiths made guns forthe Army of the Republic. Woe to the man who challenged thatarmy! The guillotine, called the national razor, would shave his head right off.        

Miss Pross bought a few small grocery items and some lamp oil, then thoughtabout what wine they wanted. After looking into several wine shops, she stoppedat a shop whose sign was of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquitythe Brutus who helped to found the Roman Republic and assassinate Julius CaesarBrutus of Antiquity. It wasnít far from theTuileries Palace, where the look of everything interested Miss Pross. The wineshop looked quieter than any other similar place they had passed. Even thoughthere were many patriotic red caps there, it wasn't as full as some otherplaces. She asked Mr. Cruncher if he thought they should go inside, and heagreed, so Miss Pross and her escort entered.             

The lights inside were dim, and people were smoking pipes and playing gameswith worn decks of cards and yellow dominoes. One bare-chested, bare-armedworkman was covered in soot and reading a journal out loud. Other peoplelistened to him. People wore weapons on them, or had set them down nearby wherethey could be easily reached. Two or three customers had slumped forward,asleep. They wore shaggy black spencersshort jacketsspencers that were popular at the time and made them looklike sleeping bears or dogs. Miss Pross and Jerry, looking out of place in thissetting, approached the counter and showed what they wanted.             

As their wine was being measured out, a man got up from a corner where he hadbeen sitting with another man and started to leave. As he went out, he cameface-to-face with Miss Pross. As soon as he faced her, Miss Pross screamed andclapped her hands.             

Immediately everyone in the shop was standing up. They all assumed there hadbeen an argument and somebody had been killed. They expected to see somebodyfall down dead, but they only saw a man and a woman standing there, staring ateach other. The man looked like a Frenchman and a patriotic Republican, and thewoman was evidently English.             

The customers were disappointed that this exchange only resulted in talk. Thecustomers of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity wine shop all startedtalking loudly. Even though they listened carefully, Miss Pross and Jerryunderstood so little of what they were saying that they could have been speakingHebrew or Chaldeana dialect of modern AramaicChaldean. Miss Pross and Jerry were too surprised to try to understand any ofthis. For not only was Miss Pross amazed and annoyed, but Mr. Cruncher, for hisown reasons, was amazed too.            

ìWhat is the matter?î said the man who had caused Miss Pross to scream. Hespoke quickly, quietly, and in English.             

ìOh, Solomon! My dear Solomon!î cried Miss Pross, clapping her hands again. ìIhavenít seen or heard from you for so long, and now I find you here!î            

ìDonít call me Solomon. Do you want to get me killed?î asked the man in asecretive, frightened way.             

ìBrother, brother!î cried Miss Pross, bursting into tears. ìHave I evertreated you so badly that you can ask me such a cruel question?î            

ìThen stop talking and come outside if you want to speak to me,î said Solomon.ìPay for your wine and come outside. Whoís this man?î            

Miss Pross shook her head dejectedly at her cold-hearted brother and saidthrough her tears. ìThis is Mr. Cruncher.î            

ìHe can come outside too,î said Solomon. ìDoes he think Iím a ghost?î            

Mr. Cruncher did, in fact, look like he had seen a ghost, but he didnít say aword. Fighting back her tears, Miss Pross looked through her reticulea small purse made of netting or lightweight fabric usually closed by a drawstringreticule and with greatdifficulty paid for the wine. As she did so, Solomon turned to the customers inthe Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity wine shop and offered them anexplanation in French. This made them all go back to what they had been doing.        

ìNow, what do you want?î asked Solomon, stopping at the dark street corner.        

ìYou are my brother, and I have always loved you,î cried Miss Pross. ìHowcruel it is for you to greet me this way and be so cold to me.î            

 ìThere, confound it! There,î said Solomon, kissing her on the lips quickly.ìNow are you happy?î            

Miss Pross shook her head and cried silently.            

ìIf you expect me to be surprised, Iím not,î said her brother. ìI knew youwere here. I know about most people who are here. If you donít want to put mylife in dangeróand I half think you doógo your way as soon as possible, and letme go mine. I am busy. I am an official now.î            

ìMy English brother, Solomon,î said Miss Pross sadly, looking up at him withtear-filled eyes, ìwho could have been one of the greatest men in England, is anofficial among foreigners! And such awful foreigners! Iíd almost rather haveseen you dead and lying in your grave.î            

ìI told you!î cried her brother, interrupting her. ìI knew it. You want to getme killed. Iíll be made a suspect by my own sister. Just as I am starting to dowell for myself!î            

ìHeaven forbid!î cried Miss Pross. ìI would rather never see you again, dearSolomon, though I have always loved you and always will. Say just one kind wordto me and tell me there is no anger or conflict between us and I will let yougo.î            

Good Miss Pross! As if any conflict between them had been her fault. As if Mr.Lorry had not known years ago in their house on the quiet corner in Soho thather ìpreciousî brother, Solomon, had spent all of her money and abandoned her!        

Solomon said his kind word to her, but in such a condescending and patronizingway that it seemed as if their positions in life were reversed (which is usuallyhow it works, all over the world). Mr. Cruncher tapped him on the shoulder andinterrupted unexpectedly. He asked him a question in his usual hoarsevoice:            

ìMay I ask you a question? Is you name John Solomon? Or Solomon John?            

Solomon turned toward him with sudden distrust. Mr. Cruncher hadnít said aword until now.             

ìCome on! Speak up,î said Mr. Cruncher (who, with his hoarse voice, couldnítspeak up himself). ìJohn Solomon, or Solomon John? She calls you Solomon, andshe must know since sheís your sister. And I know that yourname is John. Which name goes first? And what about the name Pross too? Thatwasnít your name back in England.î            

ìWhat do you mean?î            

ìWell, I donít know exactly what I mean, because I canít remember what yourname was back in England.î            

ìNo?î            

ìNo. But Iíll swear it was a name with two syllables in it.î            

ìIndeed?î            

ìYes. The other name was one syllable. I know you. You were a spy who acted asa witness at the Bailey. In the name of the Father of Liesthe devilFather of Lies, who was your father too, what namewere you called back then?î            

ìBarsad,î said someone else, joining in.             

ìThatís it! Iíd bet a thousand pounds on it!î cried Jerry.             

The man who had joined in was Sydney Carton. He had his hands behind him underhis riding coat, and he stood beside Mr. Cruncher as casually as he might havestood at the court of the Old Bailey.            

ìDonít be alarmed, my dear Miss Pross. I arrived at Mr. Lorryís and surprisedhim last night. We agreed that I wouldnít make my presence known to anyone elseuntil all was well or until I could be of use. I am showing myself here so I canask your brother to have a little talk with me. I wish you had a brother with amore respectable job than Mr. Barsad. I wish for your sake that Mr. Barsadwasnít a prison sheep.î            

ìSheepî was prison slang for ìspyî at the time. Solomon, known as the spyBarsad, was pale, and he turned even paler and asked Mr. Carton how hedaredó            

ìIíll tell you,î said Sydney. ìI saw you coming out of the prison of theConciergerie while I was looking at the walls an hour or more ago, Mr. Barsad.You have a memorable face, and I remember faces well. I was curious to see whyyou were there. Since I have good reason, as you know, to associate you with themisfortunes of our poor friend Charles Darnay, I followed you. I walked into thewine shop here right after you and sat near you. By overhearing yourconversation and hearing the rumors going around openly among your admirershere, I had no trouble figuring out that you are a spy. And gradually, my randomdecision to follow you seemed to have a purpose, Mr. Barsad.î            

ìWhat purpose?î the spy asked.             

ìIt would be difficult and dangerous to explain in the street. Could you do methe favor of meeting with me for a few minutes in secret, at the office ofTellsonís Bank for instance?î            

ìAre you threatening me?î            

ìOh! Did I say that?î            

ìIf youíre not threatening me, why should I go there?î            

ìReally, Mr. Barsad. I canít tell you why if you donít already know.î            

ìDo you mean that you wonít tell me why, sir?î asked the spyuncertainly.            

ìYou understand me very well, Mr. Barsad. I wonít tell you.î            

Cartonís casual manner helped his quickness and skill in putting his secretplan into action and dealing with a man like Barsad. He noticed this advantageand used it.             

ìNow I told you,î said the spy, looking accusingly at Miss Pross, ìif I getinto any trouble because of this, itís your fault.î            

ìCome, come, Mr. Barsad,î exclaimed Sydney. ìDonít be ungrateful. If itwerenít for the great respect I have for your sister, I might not have presentedmy little proposal so nicely. I think it will benefit both of us. Will you gowith me to the bank?î            

ìIíll listen to what you have to say. Yes, Iíll go with you.î             

ìI suggest that we escort your sister to the corner of her street first. Letme take your arm, Miss Pross. This isnít a good city for you to be outunprotected at this time. And as Mr. Cruncher knows Mr. Barsad, I will invitehim to Mr. Lorryís with us. Are we ready? Come on then!î            

Miss Pross remembered soon afterward, and to the end of her life, that as sheput her hands on Sydneyís arm, looked into his face, and begged him not to hurtSolomon, there was strength of purpose in the arm and an inspired look in hiseyes. These were not only a contradiction to his casual manner, but they changedhim and made him look more respectable. She was too occupied then with her fearsabout her brother, who was so undeserving of her love, and with Sydneyísfriendly assurances, to pay attention to the change she saw in him.            

They left her on her street corner. Carton led the way to Mr. Lorryís office,which was a few minutes away. John Barsad, also known as Solomon Pross, walkedbeside him.             

Mr. Lorry had just finished his dinner and was sitting in front of a cheerfullittle fire. Perhaps he was looking in the flames for the image of his youngerself who had looked into the red coals at the Royal George Hotel in Dover manyyears ago. He turned his head as they entered and looked surprised when he sawthe stranger, Barsad.             

ìThis is Mr. Barsad, sir. He is Miss Prossís brother,î said Sydney.             

ìBarsad?î repeated Mr. Lorry. ìBarsad? I know the name. And the face.î            

ìI told you that you had a memorable face, Mr. Barsad,î said Carton, coolly.ìPlease sit down.î            

As he took a chair, he supplied the information Mr. Lorry was looking for bysaying with a frown, ìI was a witness at that trial.î Mr. Lorry rememberedimmediately and looked at Mr. Barsad with a clear look of hatred.            

ìMr. Barsad was recognized by Miss Pross. He is the ëloving brotherí that youhave heard about,î said Sydney. ìHe has admitted it. I also have worse news.Darnay has been arrested again.î            

Mr. Lorry was shocked. ìWhat are you telling me!î he exclaimed. ìWhen I lefthim two hours ago, he was safe and free. I was about to return to him!î             

ìArrested just the same. When was he arrested, Mr. Barsad?î            

ìJust now, if he was already arrested.î            

ìMr. Barsad would know best, sir,î said Sydney. ìI heard him say to a friendwho was another spy over a bottle of wine at the wine shop that he has alreadybeen arrested. Barsad left the messengers at Darnayís gate and saw them let inby the porter. There is no doubt that he has been arrested again.î            

Mr. Lorryís business-minded eye could see by looking at Barsadís face that itwould just waste time to talk about it further. He was confused but could tellthat something might depend on his having a clear head. He pulled himselftogether and listened carefully.             

ìNow I trust that Dr. Manetteís name and influence may help him as muchtomorrowóî said Sydney. ìYou said he would be brought before the tribunal againtomorrow, Mr. Barsad?î            

ìYes, I think so.î            

ìDr. Manetteís name will help him as much tomorrow as it did today, but thatmight not be true. I admit, Mr. Lorry, that I am shaken by the fact that Dr.Manette didnít have the power to stop his arrest.î            

ìHe might not have known about it beforehand,î said Mr. Lorry.            

ìBut thatís alarming when you remember how close everyone knows he is withDarnay.î            

ìThatís true,î Mr. Lorry agreed, troubled. He rubbed his chin with his handand looked at Carton.            

ìIn short,î said Sydney, ìthis is a desperate time, when desperate games areplayed for desperate stakes. Winning Darnayís freedom is like a card game. Letthe doctor play the winning hand. Iíll play the losing one. No manís life hereis worth anything. Anyone can be carried home by the people in celebration oneday and condemned to die the next. Now, in case Dr. Manette canít help him andDarnay is sentenced to death, I have decided to try to win over a friend in theConciergerie. The friend I want to win over is Mr. Barsad.î            

ìYouíll need good cards to win me over, sir,î said Barsad.             

ìIíll look them over and see what I hold. Mr. Lorry, you know what a brute Iam and I how much I like to drink. Please give me a little brandy.î            

Brandy was put in front of him and he drank a whole glass. Then he drankanother glass and pushed the bottle away from him thoughtfully.             

ìMr. Barsad,î he continued, as if he really were looking over a hand of cards.ìYou are a prison spy and a representative of Republican committees. Youíve beenat one time a prison guard and at one time a prisoner. Youíve always been a spyand secret informer. You are much more valuable here in France for being Englishbecause an Englishman is less likely to be suspected of corruption than aFrenchman is. You present yourself to your employers under a false name. Thatísa very good card. Mr. Barsad, now employed by the Republican French government,was formerly employed by the aristocratic English government, which was theenemy of France and freedom. Thatís an excellent card. Everyone is so suspiciousin Paris these days that it would be easy to suggest that Mr. Barsad is still inthe pay of the aristocratic English government and is a spy for PittWilliam Pitt the Younger, who was prime minister of England at the timePitt. I could accuseyou of being an enemy of the Republic working right in the middle of it. I couldaccuse you of being an English traitor and a spy. Everyone says that there aretraitors and spies around, although they are so difficult to actually find.Thatís a card that beats all. Are you following me, Mr. Barsad?î            

ìI donít understand what you plan to do,î answered Barsad, uneasily.            

ìI plan to play my ace and denounce you, Mr. Barsad, to the closest SectionCommittee. Look over your hand, Mr. Barsad, and see what cards you have to play.Take your time.î            

Mr. Carton pulled the bottle of brandy toward him, poured himself anotherglass, and drank it. He saw that Barsad was worried he would get drunk and wantto denounce Barsad immediately. Seeing this, Carton poured another glass anddrank it.             

ìLook over your cards carefully, Mr. Barsad. Take your time.î            

Barsadís cards were worse than he thought. Mr. Barsad had losing cards in hishand that Sydney Carton didnít even know about. He had been thrown out of hisjob as a spy in England after much unsuccessful hard workónot because he was notwanted there (our English ideas about how much better the English are at secrecyand spying are the same as they are today). He had crossed the Channel and takena job in France. First he had baited Englishmen in France into incriminatingthemselves and had listened in on their conversations. Then he started doing thesame among the French. He knew that he had worked for the now-overthrown Frenchgovernment spying on the people of Saint Antoine and on Defargeís wine shop. Heheard news from the police about Dr. Manetteís imprisonment, release, and hispersonal history. This information had helped him get to know Monsieur andMadame Defarge. He had tried to use this information on Madame Defarge, but ithadnít worked. He always remembered with fear and trembling that Madame Defargehad been knitting while she talked with him, and she had stared threateningly athim while she knitted. He had seen her since then in that section of SaintAntoine, showing the list of names she had knitted and denouncing people, whoshortly after died on the guillotine. He knew, as all spies knew, that he wasnever safe. It was impossible to run away. He was stuck there and in danger forhis life. He knew that, despite the fact that he had switched sides and nowhelped the Republic, one word against him might lead to his downfall. He foresawthat once he was denounced and in the dilemma Mr. Carton had just described,Madame Defarge would present her list against him, and it would surely lead tohis death. All men that live secret lives are easily terrified. He had enoughbad cards to make him furious as he looked them over.             

ìYou donít seem to like your cards,î said Sydney calmly. ìWill you play yourhand?î            

ìMr. Lorry,î said Barsad, angrily, turning to him. ìYou are a kind, oldgentleman. Will you please ask Mr. Carton, who is so much younger than you,whether he can reconcile it to himself to do what he says heíll do? I admit thatI am a spy and that this is a shameful job, though somebody has to do it. Butthis gentleman isnít a spy. Why should he demean himself by accusing me?î            

ìI will play my ace in a few minutes and accuse you, Mr. Barsad, without anydoubts,î said Carton, answering himself and looking at his watch.            

ìI would have hoped that the respect you both have for my sisteróî saidBarsad, who kept trying to bring Mr. Lorry into the discussion.            

ìThere is no better way for me to prove that I respect your sister than tofinally relieve her of her brother,î said Sydney Carton.             

ìThere isnít, sir?î asked Barsad.             

ìI have completely made my mind up about it,î answered Carton.            

Barsadís smooth manner was strangely at odds with his showily ragged clothesand his usual behavior. But he was so thrown off by Carton, who was a mystery tosmarter, more honest men than Barsad, that he didnít know what to say. While hewas trying to decide what to do next, Carton said, as if looking over his cardsagain:             

ìNow that I think about it, Iím pretty sure I have another good card here thatI havenít mentioned yet. That friend and fellow spy who said he spends time inthe prisons. Who was he?î            

ìHeís French. You donít know him,î said Barsad, quickly.             

ìFrench, huh?î repeated Carton, thinking it over. He didnít seem to noticeBarsad at all, although he repeated the word after him. ìWell, he mightbe.î            

ìHe is, I assure you,î said Barsad. ìThough itís not important.î            

ìThough itís not important,î repeated Carton automatically as before. ìThoughitís not important. No. Itís not important. No. Yet I know his face.î            

ìI donít think so. Iím sure you donít. You canít,î said Barsad.             

ìI canít,î muttered Sydney Carton, thinking and twirling his glass again.Fortunately, it was a small glass. ìI canít. He spoke good French. But he spokeit like a foreigner, didnít he?î            

ìHeís from the countryside,î said Barsad.            

ìNo. Heís foreign!î cried Carton, hitting the table with his open hand as itbecame clear to him. ìCly! He was disguised, but that was Cly. That man was atthe trial at the Old Bailey.î            

ìNow, you are rushing to a conclusion,î said Barsad with a smile that made hisbeaklike nose curve to one side. ìThere you really give me an advantage. I willfully admit that Cly was my partner a long time ago. But Cly has been dead forseveral years. I saw him on his deathbed. He was buried in London at the churchof Saint Pancras-in-the-Fields. He was so unpopular with the people that Icouldnít follow his funeral to the graveyard because of the mob, but I helpedlay him in his coffin.î            

From where he was sitting, Mr. Lorry suddenly became aware of a strangegoblin-like shadow on the wall. He looked to where it was coming from anddiscovered that it was caused by Mr. Cruncherís hair, which had suddenly risenand stiffened even more than usual.             

ìLetís be reasonable,î said Barsad. ìLetís be fair. To show you how wrong youare and that your assumptions have no basis of truth, I will show you Clyísdeath certificate, which I happen to have carried in my pocketbook ever since.îHe took it out quickly and opened it. ìThere it is. Look at it! Pick it up. Itísnot a forgery.î            

Mr. Lorry saw the shadow on the wall grow longer, and Mr. Cruncher steppedforward. His hair could not have been standing up any more if it had beenarranged by the cow with the crumpled horn in the house that Jack builtthe quote, which describes a cowlick, is from ìThis Is the House That Jack Built,î by Mother Goosethe cow with the crumpled horn in the house that Jack        built.             

Barsad didnít see Mr. Cruncher standing beside him, and Mr. Cruncher tappedhim on the shoulder.            

ìSo you put Roger Cly in his coffin, master?î asked Mr.Cruncher, coldly.            

ìI did.î            

ìWho took him out of it?î            

Barsad leaned back in his chair. He said, stuttering, ìWhat do youmean?î            

ìI mean that he was never in it,î said Mr. Cruncher. ìNo! He wasnít. You canchop off my head if he was ever in it.î            

Barsad looked around at Mr. Carton and Mr. Lorry. They both looked at Jerry inastonishment.             

ìI tell you that you buried cobblestones and dirt in that coffin,î said Jerry.ìDonít tell me that you buried Cly. It was a scam. I and two more people knowit.î            

ìHow do you know?î            

ìWhy do you care, by God!î growled Mr. Cruncher. ìYouíre the person I have anold grudge against, arenít you? Causing trouble for an honest businessman? Iídchoke you to death for half a guinea.î            

Sydney Carton and Mr. Lorry were amazed by this unexpected turn. Carton askedMr. Cruncher to calm down and explain himself.            

ìIíll explain some other time, sir,î he answered evasively. ìNow is not thetime to explain. I say that he knows full well that Cly was never in thatcoffin. Let him say one syllable of one word that he was, and Iíll choke him todeath for half a guineaóî Mr. Cruncher made this sound like a generous offerìóor Iíll go outside and accuse him.î            

ìHumph! I see one thing,î said Carton. ìI hold another card, Mr. Barsad. Thereis a violent atmosphere, full of suspicion, here in Paris. It would beimpossible for you to live through being accused of communicating with anotheraristocratic spy who has the same history as your own. Someone who also fakedhis own death and has come back to life again! You will be accused of being aforeigner who was starting plots in the prisons against the Republic. That is agood card, a card that will certainly send you to the guillotine. Will you playyour hand?î            

ìNo!î answered Barsad. ìI give up. I confess that we were so unpopular withthe mob that I only got away from England at the risk of being drowned to death,and that Cly was being chased so much that he never would have gotten away if hehadnít faked his own death. Though how Mr. Cruncher knows that it was a scam Ihave no idea.î            

ìDonít worry about me,î answered Mr. Cruncher angrily. ìYouíll have enoughtrouble dealing with these two gentleman. And look here! Once again!î Mr.Cruncher couldnít be stopped from showing off his generosity. ìIíd grab you bythe throat and choke you for half a guinea.î            

Barsad, the prison spy, turned from Mr. Cruncher to Sydney Carton and saiddecisively, ìLetís get to the point. I go on duty soon and canít be late. Youtold me you had a proposal. What is it? Now, itís no use asking too much fromme. If you ask me to do anything as an official of the Republic that puts me intoo much danger, it would be better for me take my chances and refuse you thanto agree. In short, I will refuse you. You talk of desperation. Everyone isdesperate. Remember! I might denounce you if I think itís what I should do. Ican lie very well, and so can others. Now, what do you want me to do?î            

ìNot very much. You are a prison guard at the Conciergerie?î            

ìIíll tell you for sure that there is no way to escape,î said Barsad,firmly.            

ìWhy are you telling me what I didnít ask? You are a guard at theConciergerie?î            

ìI am sometimes.î            

ìYou can be a guard there when you want to be?î            

ìI can go in and out when I choose.î            

Sydney Carton filled another glass with brandy and poured it slowly on thehearth of the fireplace. He watched it as it spilled out, and after it was allgone he said, getting up:             

ìSo far, we have spoken in front of these two because it made sense that thisdiscussion wasnít just between the two of us. Now letís go into this dark roomand have one final word alone.î             

Sydney Carton and Barsad were in the dark room next door, speaking so quietlythat no sound was heard. Mr. Lorry looked at Jerry with doubt and mistrust. Theway Cruncher, the honest businessman, reacted to this look didnít make Mr. Lorryany more confident. Cruncher shifted back and forth on his feet as often as ifhe had fifty feet and were standing on each of them. He looked at hisfingernails a little too closely, and whenever Mr. Lorry looked him in the eye,Mr. Cruncher would cough and put his hand over his mouth like a man who washiding something.            

ìCome here, Jerry,î said Mr. Lorry.            

Mr. Cruncher came toward him, moving sideways and leading with oneshoulder.            

ìWhat job have you had, besides being a messenger?î            

After thinking about it and looking intently at Mr. Lorry, Mr. Cruncher hadthe bright idea of answering, ìItís of an agricultural nature.î            

ìI am concerned that you have used the respectable and great Tellsonís Bank asa cover, and that you have been doing something illegal. If you have, donítexpect me to remain friendly with you when you get back to England. If you have,donít expect me to keep your secret. You cannot take advantage of TellsonísBank.î             

ìIíve had the honor of working for you until Iíve turned gray, so I hope thata gentleman like you would think twice about harming me. Even if what you say istrueóI donít say that it is trueóbut if it was. And it should be taken intoaccount that if it were true, there would be two sides to the story. There mightbe doctors right now earning guineasan English coin with a high valueguineas when an honest businessman like me doesnít even earn farthingsan English coin worth one-quarter of a pennyfarthings. Farthings! No, not even half-farthings.Half-farthings! No, not even quarter-farthings. These doctors come intoTellsonís to do their banking and start giving me knowing looks on the sly asthey go out to their private carriages. Well, they are imposing on Tellsonís,too. You canít blame the goose and not the gander. And then thereís Mrs.Cruncher to deal with, or at least I had to deal with her back in England. Sheísalways flinging herself down and praying against my success so much that itruins me. Ruins me! Whereas those medical doctorsí wives donít pray againstthem. Those doctors would catch them at it. Or if they pray, they pray for morepatients, and how can you have one without the other? Then, what withundertakers to bribe, and parish clerks, and sextons, and greedy private guards,a man wouldnít even earn that much. And what little a man did earn would neverbe enough to allow him to prosper, Mr. Lorry. Things would never be good forhim. The whole time heíd want to give up that line of work, if he could find away out of it after having already been in itóif what you say is true.î             

ìUgh!î cried Mr. Lorry, relenting, nevertheless. ìI am shocked at the sight ofyou.î            

ìNow, what I would like to offer you, sir,î continued Mr. Cruncher, ìeven ifit was true, which I donít say it isóî            

ìDonít avoid the question,î said Mr. Lorry.            

ìNo, I will not, sir,î answered Mr. Cruncher as if nothingwere further from his mind. ìI donít say that it is true. Hereís my offer, sir.My boy is sitting on that stool there at Temple Bar. I brought him up and hishas grown into a man. If you want, he will run errands and messages for you anddo general small jobs for you until youíre dead. If it was true, although Istill donít say it isófor I wonít avoid the subject, sirólet the boy take myplace and work for you. Let him take care of his mother. Donít turn me in, sir,let me go into honest grave digging full-time and make up for the graves I dugupóif it was trueóby digging them legally and keeping them safe. That, Mr.Lorry, is what I respectfully offer you, sir,î said Mr. Cruncher, wiping hisforehead with his arm to show that he was finishing his speech. ìThere are somany people having their heads cut off that it is bringing down the wages a mancan earn as a porter. A man doesnít see all of these dreadful things going onaround him without having serious thoughts about things, and these would be mythoughts. I beg you to remember that I said what I said about Mr. Barsad to helpMr. Darnay. I could have kept quiet.î             

ìAt least that is true,î said Mr. Lorry. ìDonít say any more for now. I mightstill be your friend, if you deserve it, and if you repent in action, not justin words. I donít want to hear any more words.î            

Mr. Cruncher was rubbing his forehead with his knuckle as Sydney Carton andBarsad came back from the dark room. ìAdieu, Mr. Barsad,î said Carton. ìNow thatwe have made our arrangement, you donít have to be afraid of me.î            

He sat down in a chair by the fire near Mr. Lorry. When they were alone, Mr.Lorry asked him what he had done.             

ìNot much. If things should go badly with Darnay in prison, I have made surethat we will be able to visit him once.î            

Mr. Lorry looked disappointed.             

ìItís all I could do,î said Carton. ìIf I demanded too much of him, it wouldput his life in danger. As he said himself, the same thing would happen to himif he were denounced. It was the obvious weakness of my position. There isnothing to be done about it.î            

ìBut if things go badly in front of the tribunal, going to visit him wonítsave him,î said Mr. Lorry.            

ìI never said that it would.î            

Mr. Lorry eventually looked back at the fire. The sympathy he had for Lucieand his disappointment over Darnayís second arrest gradually weakened him. Hewas an old man now. Lately he had been overwhelmed by anxiety, and he started tocry.             

ìYou are a good man and a true friend,î said Carton. His voice soundeddifferent. ìForgive me if I notice that you are moved by this. If you were myfather, I couldnít watch you weep and sit by without caring. And I could notrespect your sorrow more if you were my own father. Fortunately for you, you arenot my father.î            

Though he said the last words with a slip into his usual casual manner, therewas sincerity in his tone and in his touch that Mr. Lorry didnít expect. He hadnever seen Cartonís gentle side. Mr. Lorry gave Carton his hand, and Cartongently squeezed it.            

ìTo return to the subject of poor Darnay,î said Carton. ìDonít tell Lucieabout this conversation or the arrangement we have made. She wonít be able to gosee him. She might think that, in the worst case, it was arranged to bring him away of killing himself before he was sent to the guillotine.î            

Mr. Lorry hadnít thought of that, and he looked quickly at Carton to see ifthatís what he was thinking. It seemed that it was, and Carton looked back athim as if they understood each other.            

ìShe might think a thousand different things,î said Carton. ìAny of them wouldonly make her worry more. Donít mention me to her. As I told you when I firstarrived, itís better that I donít see her. I can reach out and do what littlefor her that I can without her seeing me. You are going to visit her, I hope?She must be very unhappy tonight.î            

ìI am going there right now.î            

ìIím glad. Sheís attached to you and relies on you. How does she look?î            

ìAnxious and unhappy, but very beautiful.î            

ìAh!î            

Carton made a long, grieving sound, like a sighóalmost like a sob. It made Mr.Lorry look at Cartonís face, which was turned to the fire. A light, or a shadow(Mr. Lorry couldnít have said which), passed over his face quickly. He used hisfoot to put back a small flaming log that had rolled forward in the fire. Hewore a white riding coat and boots, which were in style then, an their lightsurfaces in the light of the fire made him look very pale. His long, uncut brownhair hung loosely around him. He didnít seem to notice the fire, and Mr. Lorrywarned him that his boot was still on the hot embers of the flaming log afterthe log had broken under the weight of his foot.             

ìI forgot it,î he said.            

Mr. Lorry looked at his face again. He noticed a wasted look that tarnishedhis naturally handsome face and was reminded of the expression on the faces ofprisoners he had seen lately.             

ìAnd your work here is coming to an end, sir?î said Carton, turning towardhim.             

ìYes. As I was telling you last night when Lucie came in so unexpectedly, Ihave finally done all I can do here. I had hoped to leave the Manettes perfectlysafe and then to leave Paris. I have my pass, which allows me to leave the city.I was ready to go.î            

They were both silent.             

ìYou have had a long life to look back on, sir?î said Cartonthoughtfully.            

ìI am seventy-eight years old.î            

ìYou have worked hard all your life. You have always been busy. You aretrusted, respected, and looked up to?î            

ìI have been a businessman ever since I became a man. I was even a businessmanwhen I was still a boy.î            

ìLook at what you are doing at the age of seventy-eight. How many people willmiss you when you die!î            

ìI am a lonely, old bachelor,î answered Mr. Lorry, shaking his head. ìNobodywill weep for me when I die.î             

ìHow can you say that? Wouldnít Lucie weep for you? Wouldnít herdaughter?î            

ìYes, yes. Thank God. I didnít mean exactly what I said.î            

ìIt is something to thank God for, isnít it?î            

ìOf course.î            

ìIf you could say truthfully tonight, ëNo one has any love, attachment,gratitude, or respect for me. No one thinks of me tenderly. I have done nothinggood or helpful to be remembered by!í the years you have lived would be a curseinstead of a blessing, wouldnít they?î            

ìThatís true, Mr. Carton. I think they would be.î            

Sydney looked at the fire again. After sitting in silence for a few moments,he said:            

ìI want to ask you. Does your childhood seem like it was a long time ago? Dothe days when you sat at your motherís knee seem like a long time ago?î            

Mr. Lorry could see that Carton had softened. He answered:            

ìTwenty years ago, yes. But at this time of my life, no, it doesnít. As I getcloser and closer to death, itís as if I was traveling in a circle and movingnearer and nearer to the beginning. It seems to be one of the kind ways weprepare ourselves for death. I now remember fondly many memories that I hadforgotten for a long time. Memories of my pretty mother and the times when I wasyoung. Times when the world didnít seem so harsh to me and I didnít know my ownfaults.î            

ìI understand that feeling!î exclaimed Carton, blushing. ìAnd you are thebetter for it?î            

ìI hope so.î            

Carton ended the conversation then by getting up to help Mr. Lorry put hiscoat on. ìBut youóyou are young,î said Mr. Lorry, returning to thesubject.            

ìYes,î said Carton. ìI am not old, but my youthful behavior was not a good wayto age. Enough about me.î            

ìAnd enough about me,î said Mr. Lorry. ìAre you going out?î            

ìIíll walk with you to Lucieís gate. You know my wandering and restlesshabits. If I roam the streets for a long time, donít worry. I will come back inthe morning. You are going to the court tomorrow?î            

ìYes, unfortunately.î            

ìIíll be there, but only as a member of the crowd. Barsad will find a placefor me. Take my arm, sir.î            

Mr. Lorry took his arm, and they went downstairs and out into the streets. Ina few minutes they were at Mr. Lorryís destination. Carton left him there, buthe waited a little ways off. When the gate was shut again he went back andtouched it. He had heard that Lucie went to stand outside the prison every day.ìShe came out here,î he said, looking around him. ìShe turned this way. She musthave walked on these cobblestones often. Let me follow her steps.î            

It was ten oíclock at night when he arrived in front of La Force Prison, whereshe had stood hundreds of times. A little wood sawyer had closed up his shop andwas smoking his pipe in the shop door.             

ìGood evening, citizen,î said Sydney Carton. He paused as he went by, for theman was looking at him curiously.             

ìGood evening, citizen.î            

ìHowís the Republic doing?î            

ìYou mean the guillotine. Not bad. Sixty-three people killed today. We willmake it to a hundred soon. The executioner, Samson, and his men complainsometimes of being exhausted. Ha, ha, ha! Heís funny, that Samson. Such a barberwielding our National Razor!î             

ìDo you go to see executions at the guillotine very often?î            

ìDo I see people getting ëa shaveí? Always. Every day. Heís quite the barber.Youíve seen him at work?î            

ìNever.î            

ìGo and see him when he has a good group of prisoners. Think about this,citizen. He killed sixty-three people today, in less time than it took me tosmoke two pipes. Less than two pipes! I swear!î            

The grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking to show how he hadtimed the executioner. Carton wanted to beat the man to death so badly that heturned away from him.            

ìBut you are not English, although you dress like an Englishman?î asked thewood sawyer.î            

ìYes,î said Carton. He paused again and answered over his shoulder.             

ìYou speak like a Frenchman.î            

ìI studied a long time here.î            

ìAh-ha, youíre like a perfect Frenchman! Good night, Englishman.î            

ìGood night, citizen.î            

ìBut go and see the executioner,î the little man continued, yelling after him.ìAnd take a pipe with you!î            

Sydney had not gone far out of sight when he stopped in the middle of thestreet under a shining streetlamp. He wrote something down in pencil on a scrapof paper, then walked through several dark and dirty streets with the confidenceof a man who remembered the way well. The streets were dirtier than usual, aseven the best roads werenít cleaned during those violent times. He stopped at achemistís shop, which was just closing up. The shop was located on a main roadthat went up a steep hill. It was small, dark, and crooked, and a small, dark,and crooked man owned it.            

He said good evening to the shopkeeper, too, as he went up to the counter. Heput the scrap of paper in front of him. ìWhew!î the chemist whistled softly ashe read it. ìHi, hi, hi!î            

Sydney Carton ignored him. The chemist said:            

ìThis is for you, citizen?î            

ìItís for me.î            

ìYouíll make sure to keep them separate, citizen? You know what will happen ifyou mix them.î            

ìI know perfectly well.î            

The chemist made up some small packets and gave them to Mr. Carton, who putthem in the breast pocket of his inner coat one by one. He counted out the moneyfor them, paid the shopkeeper, and left the shop quickly. ìThere is nothing moreI can do until tomorrow,î he said, looking up at the moon. ìI canítsleep.î            

He said this aloud under the clouds that were moving quickly across the sky.He didnít say these words casually. He said them defiantly. He had thedetermination of a tired man who had wandered and struggled and gotten lost, butwho had finally found the right path and saw the end in sight.             

Long ago, when Carton had been famous among his early competitors as a youngman with a great future ahead of him, his father had died. His mother had diedyears earlier. Now he thought of the solemn words that he had read at hisfatherís grave as he walked down the dark streets covered with shadows. The moonand clouds sailed high above him. He thought, ìI am the resurrection and thelife, says the Lord. Whoever believes in me that is dead will live again.Whoever lives and believes in me will never die.î            

Mr. Carton was alone at night in Paris, which was dominated by the guillotine.He was feeling sympathy for the sixty-three people who had been executed thatday and sympathy for the people now in prison who would be executed tomorrow.There were many reasons to think about these words, and he repeated them andwalked on.             

He looked at the lit windows where people were going to sleep and could forgetthe horrible things happening around them for a few calm hours. He looked at thetowers of the churches where no one was praying, for the people were evendisgusted by religion after years of corruption by thieves, vagrants, and peopleacting as priests. He looked at the graveyards far away reserved for ìeternalsleep,î as it was written on the graveyard gates. He looked at the surroundingjails and the streets along which the sixty or so condemned people were carriedin carts to their deaths. This had become so common that no one even made upghost stories about the people killed at the guillotine. He thought about thelives and deaths of everyone in Paris as they all settled down to sleep. ThenSydney Carton crossed the Seine River again and headed for better-lit streets.        

There werenít many coaches in the streets, as people riding in coaches wereoften suspected. The higher classes hid among the peasants by wearing red capsand heavy shoes and walking with everyone else, but the theaters were full. Ashe walked past, people poured out of them cheerfully and went home, talkingtogether. At one of the theater doors there was a little girl with her mother.They were looking for a way to cross the street through the mud. Sydney carriedthe child across the street. Before she had let go of his neck, he asked her fora kiss.            

ìI am the resurrection and the life, says the Lord. Whoever believes in me,even though he is dead, he shall live. And whoever lives and believes in meshall never die.î            

 Now that the streets were quiet and the night continued on, the words echoedaround him. He was completely calm and steady. Sometimes he repeated them outloud to himself as he walked, but he heard them continuously in his head.        

Then the night was over. He stood on a bridge listening to the water as itsplashed against the river walls of the island of Paris. A beautiful cluster ofhouses and a cathedral shone in the moonlight. The day came on coldly, lookinglike a dead personís face in the sky. Then the night, with the moon and thestars, turned pale and faded away, and for a little while it seemed like deathhad taken over the whole world.             

Then the glorious sun rose and it was daylight. It warmed Sydneyís heart withits long, bright rays. As he shaded his eyes with his hand and looked at thesunshine, it looked like there was a bridge of light between him and the sun,and the river sparkled below it.             

The tide was strong and fast and always there, like a friend in the stillnessof the morning. He walked by the stream, far away from the houses, and fellasleep on the riverbank in the light and warmth of the sun. Then he woke up andstood there a little longer. He watched a whirlpool in the stream that turnedand turned without purpose until the stream absorbed it and carried it out tosea. ìLike me,î thought Sydney.            

A trading boat glided into view. Its sail was the color of a dead leaf, and itfloated by him and died away. As the track of water that it made disappeared,the prayer he had been repeating to himself asking mercy for all his faults andmistakes ended with the words, ìI am the resurrection and the life.î            

Mr. Lorry was already out when he got back. It was easy to guess where he hadgone. Sydney Carton drank nothing but a little coffee and ate some bread. Afterhe washed up and changed clothes to refresh himself, he went to Darnayístrial.            

The court was full of noise and activity, when the court officials, whom manymoved away from in fear, pushed him into a corner of the crowd. Mr. Lorry wasthere, and so was Dr. Manette. Lucie was there, sitting next to her father.        

Lucie turned to look at Darnay when he was brought in. She was supportive,encouraging, and full of love and tenderness, and she was being so brave for hissake that it made him blush. It brightened his glance and made his heart beatfast. If anyone had noticed how her appearance changed Sydney Carton, they wouldhave noticed that the exact same look was now on his face, too.             

There was hardly any order of procedure at the unjust tribunal that assured anaccused person of receiving a fair hearing. The Revolution had eliminated all ofthe laws, formalities, and ceremonies of the government, the terrible abuse ofwhich caused the Revolution in the first place.             

Everyone looked at the jury. The same patriots and republicans were on thejury that had been there the day before and would still be there the day after.There was one man among them who seemed important and eager. He had a greedylook on his face, and his fingers were constantly moving around his lips. Thecrowd was very happy to see him, and he looked thirsty for blood as if he were acannibal. He was Jacques Three from Saint Antoine. The whole jury was as hungryas a jury of dogs brought together to put a deer on trial.             

Everyone turned to look at the five judges and the public prosecutor. No oneamong them looked sympathetic. They all looked vicious and murderous. Theneveryone looked at the other people in the crowd, and the all nodded their headsapprovingly to each other before they leaned forward attentively.             

The prosecutor stated Darnayís case. His name was Charles Evremonde, alsoknown as Darnay. He was released yesterday. He was reaccused and taken incustody again yesterday. The formal accusation was delivered to him last night.He is suspected and denounced as an enemy of the Republic. He is an aristocrat.He comes from a family of tyrants who have been banned for using their power tooppress the peasants. Charles Evremonde, also known as Darnay, has been bannedby the law and should definitely be sentenced to death.             

In this way, in as few words or fewer, the public prosecutor pronounced hissentence.             

The president asked if Darnay had been denounced openly or secretly.            

ìThe prosecutor answered, ìOpenly, president.î            

ìBy whom?î asked the president.            

ìBy three people. Ernest Defarge, a wine seller from Saint Antoine,î answeredthe prosecutor.            

ìGood.î            

ìTherese Defarge, his wife.î            

ìGood.î            

ìDr. Alexandre Manette.î            

The crowd in the courtroom roared. Dr. Manette could be seen in the middle ofthe crowd, pale and trembling. He had stood up where he had been sitting.        

ìPresident, I protest that this is a forgery and a fraud. You know that Darnayis my daughterís husband. My daughter, and those she loves, are much moreimportant to me than my own life. Who and where is the liar who says that Idenounced my daughterís husband!î            

ìCalm down, Citizen Manette. To speak out of turn against the authority of thetribunal is breaking the law. Regarding what is more important to you than yourlife, nothing can be as important to a good citizen as the Republic.î            

People cheered loudly at this, and the president rang his bell andcontinued.            

ìIf the Republic demanded that you give up even your own child, you would haveto sacrifice her. Listen to what will follow. In the meantime, be quiet!î            

The crowd shouted again, and Dr. Manette sat down. He looked around him. Hislips were trembling, and Lucie pulled closer to him. Jacques Three in the juryrubbed his hands together and brought his hand to his mouth as usual.             

Defarge came forward. When the court was quiet enough for him to be heard, hequickly told the story of Manetteís imprisonment and how Defarge had been aservant of Dr. Manette when he was just a boy. He told them about Manetteísrelease, and about the state he was in when he was released and brought to theattic in Saint Antoine. This short examination came next, as the court was quickwith its work:             

ìYou did good work at the taking of the Bastille, Citizen Defarge?î            

ìI believe so.î            

At this, an excited woman yelled from the crowd, ìYou were one of the bestpatriots there. Why not say so? You were firing a cannon that day. You wereamong the first to enter the accursed Bastille when it fell. Patriots, Iímtelling the truth!î            

It was The Vengeance who was yelling. The crowd cheered warmly along with her,and the president rang his bell. But The Vengeance, feeling encouraged,shrieked, ìI defy that bell!î and the crowd cheered her again.             

ìTell the tribunal what you did at the Bastille that day, CitizenDefarge.î            

Defarge looked down at his wife. She stood at the bottom of the steps where hewas standing, looking up at him steadily. ìI knew that this prisoner, Manette,had been held in the cell known as One Hundred and Five, North Tower. He told meso himself. He only knew himself by the name One Hundred and Five, North Tower,when he was in my care and still making shoes. While I was firing my cannon thatday, I decided that when the fortress fell I would examine that cell. TheBastille fell and I went up to the cell with another citizen who is on the jury,directed by the jailer. I examined it very closely. There was a hole in thechimney where a stone had been pulled out and replaced. In it I found a paperwith writing on it. This is that piece of paper. I have made it my business toexamine other examples of Dr. Manetteís writing. This is Dr. Manetteíshandwriting. I give this paper, written by Dr. Manette, to the president.        

ìLet it be read.î            

Everything was dead silent and still. Darnay looked lovingly at his wife. Hiswife would only look away from him to look at her father with concern. Dr.Manette kept looking at the reader. Madame Defarge never looked away fromDarnay, and Defarge never looked away from his wife. Everyone else looked at thedoctor intently, but the doctor didnít notice any of them. The paper was read,as follows.             

ìI, Alexandre Manette, an unfortunate doctor, born in Beauvais and later aresident of Paris, am writing this paper in my cell in the Bastille in December1767. I write it a few moments at a time, under very difficult conditions. Iplan to hide it in the wall of the chimney, where I have slowly and with muchdifficulty made a hiding place for it. Someone might find it there when mysorrows and I have both died away.             

ìI write these words with a rusty iron point and with bits of soot andcharcoal from the chimney, mixed with my blood. This is December of the tenthyear I have been in prison. I have no hope left. I know from warning signs Ihave seen in myself that I will soon lose my sense of reason, but I swear thatat the moment I am in my right mind, that my memory is sharp. As these will bemy last written words I swear that what I write is the truth, whether my wordsare ever read by men on earth or by God on the day of Judgment.            

ìOne cloudy moonlit night in the third week of December 1757 (I think it wasDecember 22nd), I was walking on a secluded part of the quay by the Seine Riverto get some fresh air. I was an hour away from my home on the Street of theSchool of Medicine when a carriage came up behind me moving very quickly. As Istood aside to let the carriage go by, fearing that it might run me overotherwise, someone put his head out of the window and a voice called to thedriver to stop.             

ìThe carriage stopped as soon as the driver could slow down the horses, andthe same voice called to me by name. I answered. The carriage was so far aheadof me by then that the two gentlemen had time to open the door and get outbefore I came up to it.             

ìI saw that they were both wrapped up in cloaks and appeared to hidethemselves. As they stood side by side near the carriage door, I could also seethat they both looked to be about my age, or a bit younger. They looked verymuch alike in size, behavior, and voice and, as far as I could see, in face too.        

ìëYou are Dr. Manette?í said one.             

ìI am.î            

ìëDr. Manette from Beauvais,í said the other. ëThe young doctor who was anexpert surgeon and who has built a good reputation for himself here in Paris inthe last year or two?î            

ìëGentlemen,í I answered, ëI am the man that you speak of so kindly.í            

ìëWe have been to your house,í said the first man. ëWe didnít find you thereand were told that you were probably walking in this direction. We followed you,hoping to catch up. Will you please get in our carriage?í            

ìThey were both intimidating. As they said this, they both moved so that I wasbetween them and the carriage door. They were armed, and I was not.            

ìëExcuse me, gentlemen,í I said, ëbut I usually ask who is seeking my help andwhat the patientís illness is.í            

ìThe man who had spoken second answered this. ëDoctor, the clients who needyour help are important people. We are confident in your skills and are sure youcan decide for yourself what the illness is better than we can describe it.Enough. Will you please get in the carriage?í            

ìI could do nothing but obey, and I got into the carriage in silence. Theyboth got in after me, the last one in jumped in after putting up the steps. Thecarriage turned around and drove on as fast as before.            

ìI repeat the conversation that followed exactly as it occurred. I have nodoubt that it is, word for word, the same. I describe everything exactly as ithappened and force my mind to stay focused on the task. The broken marks thatfollow indicate where I stopped writing for the moment and returned my paper toits hiding place.            

***            

ìThe carriage drove beyond the city streets, passed the north barrier, andcame out onto a country road. At two-thirds of a league away from the barrier,the carriage left the main road and soon stopped at a secluded house. I didnítestimate the distance then but did so afterward when I returned. The three of usgot out and walked along a damp, soft path in a garden, where a neglectedfountain had overflowed, to the door of the house. When they rang the bell, thedoor did not open right away. When a servant finally opened it, one of the twomen with me slapped the servant across the face with his riding glove.             

ìThere was nothing unusual about this, as I had seen common people hit moreoften than dogs. But the second of the two men, who was also angry, hit the manin the face with his arm. Their look and behavior was so exactly alike that thiswas when I first noticed they were twin brothers.             

ìThe outer gate had been locked, and one of the brothers opened it to let usin and then locked it again. From the time we had gotten out of the carriage atthe outer gate I heard cries coming from a room upstairs. I was taken straightto this room, and the cries grew louder as we climbed the stairs. I found apatient with a high fever of the brain lying on a bed.             

ìThe patient was a beautiful young woman, not much more than twenty years old.Her hair was torn and ragged, and her arms were tied to her sides with sashesand handkerchiefs. I noticed that these ties were all pieces of a gentlemaníswardrobe. On one of them, which was a fringed ceremonial scarf, I saw the coatof arms of a noble family and the letter E.

ìI saw this in the first minute of examining the patient. In her twisting andturning she had turned over on her face on the edge of the bed. She had takenthe end of the scarf in her mouth and was in danger of suffocating. The firstthing I did was to reach out my hand to help her breathe, and in moving asidethe scarf, I saw the embroidered coat of arms.             

ìI turned her over gently and placed my hands on her chest to calm her andkeep her down. I looked into her face. Her eyes were dilated and wild, and shewas screaming constantly. She repeated the words, ëMy husband, my father, and mybrother!í Then she would count to twelve and say ëHush!í She would pause andlisten for just a moment, then she would would repeat the cry, ëMy husband, myfather, and my brother!í and count up to twelve and say ëHush!í This was alwaysexactly the same. Except for her regular pauses, she never stopped saying thesewords.            

ìëHow long has she been doing this?í I asked.            

ìTo distinguish between the two brothers, I will call them the older and theyounger. By the older, I mean the one that seemed to be in charge. It was theolder brother who replied, ëSince about this time last night.í            

ìëShe has a husband, a father, and a brother?í            

ìëShe has a brother.í            

ìëYou are not her brother?í            

ìHe answered with great contempt, ëNo.í            

ìëShe has some recent connection with the number twelve?í            

ìThe younger brother impatiently joined in, ëDo you mean with twelveoíclock?í            

ìëSee, gentlemen,í I said, keeping my hands on her chest, ëI am useless as youhave brought me! If I had known what I was coming to see, I could have broughtwhat I needed. As it is, we must lose more time. There is nowhere to findmedicine out here in this lonely place.í            

ìThe older brother looked at the younger brother. He said haughtily, ëThere isa case full of medicine here.í He took the case out of a closet and put it onthe table.î            

 * * *             

ìI opened some of the bottles, smelled them, and put the stoppers to my lips.I wouldnít have used any of them unless I wanted to narcotics that were poisonsin themselves.             

ìëDo you think they wonít work?í asked the younger brother.             

ìYou see, monsieur, Iím going to use them,í I replied, and said nomore.            

ìAfter trying very hard several times, I made the patient swallow the dose Iwanted her to take. I planned to do the same thing again after a while. I neededto watch how it affected her, so I sat down by the side of the bed. There was anervous, fearful peasant woman there who was the wife of the man downstairs. Shehad retreated into a corner. The house was damp and falling apart, and it wasfurnished indifferently, suggesting it had only recently been occupied and onlyused temporarily. Some thick tapestries had been nailed up over the windows todeaden the sounds of the womanís screams. She continued to scream constantly andto cry out, ìMy husband, my father, and my brother!î Then she would count up totwelve and say ëHush!í Her fit was so violent that I didnít untie the bandagesrestraining her arms. But I looked at them to make sure they werenít hurtingher. The only encouraging thing about her case was that when I placed my handson her chest it seemed to calm her for a few minutes. It didnít stop thescreams, which happened as regularly as the swinging of a pendulum.             

ìSince I assumed that my hand was calming her, I sat by her bedside for halfan hour while the two brothers looked on. Then the older brother said:            

ìëThere is another patient.í            

ìI was surprised. I asked, ëIs it a serious case?í            

ìëYouíd better see for yourself,í he answered carelessly, and picked up alantern.î            

***            

ìThe other patient was lying in a back room across a second staircase. It wasa kind of loft over a stable. There was a low plastered ceiling over part of it,and the rest of it was open to the edge of the tiled roof. There were beamsacross it. Hay and straw were stored in that part of it, as well as small piecesof firewood and piles of apples stored in sand. I had to walk through that partto get to the other side of the room. My memory is sharp, and I challenge itwith these details. Here in my cell in the Bastille I see them all as clearly asI saw them that night.             

ìA handsome peasant boy was lying on his back on some hay on the ground, witha cushion under his head. The boy wasnít older than seventeen. His teeth wereclenched, his right hand was grabbing his chest, and his eyes were staringstraight up. I couldnít see where his wound was as I kneeled over him on oneknee, but I could see he was dying of a stab wound.             

ìëI am a doctor, my poor fellow,í I said. ëLet me examine it.í            

ìëI donít want you to examine it,í he answered. ëLeave it alone.í            

ìThe wound was under his hand. I calmed him and he let me move his hand away.The wound had come from the thrust of a sword, done twenty to twenty-four hoursearlier. But no one could have saved him even it had been looked at right away.He was dying fast. As I looked at the older brother I saw him looking down atthis handsome dying boy as if he were a wounded bird, or a rabbit, not at alllike a fellow human.            

ìëHow did this happen, monsieur?í I asked one of the brothers.            

ìëHeís a crazy young peasant! A serf! He forced my brother to draw his swordon him, and he has been wounded by my brotherís swordólike a gentleman.í            

ìThere was no hint of pity, sorrow, or humanity in his answer. He seemed toadmit that it was inconvenient to have a peasant dying there and that it wouldhave been better if he had died unnoticed, as peasants usually did. He wasunable to feel any compassion for the dying boy.             

ìThe boy had looked at the brother slowly as he spoke. Now he slowly looked atme.            

ìëDoctor, these nobles are very proud. But sometimes we peasants are proud,too. They steal from us, anger us, beat us, and kill us. But sometimes we stillhave a little pride left. Sheóhave you seen her, doctor?í            

ìThe screams and cries could be heard there, although they were quieter and inthe distance. The boy referred to them as if she were lying there nearus.            

ìI said, ëI have seen her.í            

ìëShe is my sister, Doctor. They have taken their right as nobles and have hadtheir way with our sisters and peasant women for many years. But we have goodgirls among us. I know it and have heard my father say so. My sister was a goodgirl. She was engaged to a good young man too, a serf that belonged to thisnoble. We were all serfs that belonged to himóthat man standing there. The otherman is his brother. He is the worst of all of this terrible family.í            

ìIt was very difficult for the boy to find the strength to speak. But he spokewith a dreadful passion.            

ìëWe were robbed by that man standing there, the way all peasants are robbedby nobles. We were taxed mercilessly and forced to work for him without pay. Wewere forced to grind our corn at his mill and forced to feed our poor crops tohis tame birds. We werenít allowed to keep any tame birds ourselves. We wererobbed and abused so much that when we did have the luck to have a bit of meatto eat, we ate it in fear, with the door barred and the shutters closed so noone would see it and take it away from us. We were robbed, hunted, and made sopoor that our father told us that it was a terrible thing to bring a child intothe world. He told us that we should pray that our women would be unable to givebirth and that our family would die out!í             

ìI had never seen someone speak of their oppression so passionately before. Ihad assumed that it had to be deep down inside the peasants somewhere, but I hadnever seen it break out until I saw this dying boy.             

ìëNevertheless, Doctor, my sister got married. Her husband was sick at thetime, the poor fellow. She married the man she loved so that she could take careof him and comfort him in our cottageóour doghouse, as that man would call it.She had only been married a few weeks when that manís brother saw her and wasattracted to her. He asked her husband to lend her to him. What terriblehusbands are there among us! The husband was willing enough, but my sister wasgood and virtuous. She hated this manís brother as much as I did. What did thetwo brothers do then to persuade her husband to convince her to go through withit?í            

ìThe boy had been staring into my eyes. He slowly turned to the brothers, andI saw in their faces that everything he said was true. The pride of the boyconfronted the pride of the two brothers. Even here in the Bastille I can seethe gentlemanís indifference and the oppressed boyís desire for revenge.            

ìëYou know, Doctor, that these nobles have the right to harness us to cartslike common dogs and drive us through the fields. So, they harnessed her husbandto a cart and drove him. You know that they have the right to make us stayoutside on the grounds all night keeping the frogs quiet so that the noblesísleep isnít disturbed. They kept him out in the cold mists at night and orderedhim back into a harness during the day. But he was not persuaded. No! One day atnoon he was taken out of his harness to eatóif he could find anything to eat. Hesobbed twelve timesóonce for every stroke of the bell. Then he died in herarms.í            

ìNothing could have kept the boy alive except for his determination to tellhow they had been wronged. He fought back death the way he forced his right handto remain clenched over his wound.             

ìëThen, this man gave his brother permission to have his way with her. He evenhelped him to take her away, despite what I know she must have told his brother.You will know what she told him soon, Doctor, if you do not know already. Hisbrother took her away for his pleasure and enjoyment for a little while. I sawher pass me on the road. When I told everyone at home, my fatherís heart burstand he died. He never said a word. I took my younger sisterófor I haveanotherósomewhere where this man could never reach her and where, at least, shewill never be his slave. Then I followed the brother here. Lastnight I climbed in his window. I was still a common peasant, but I had a swordin my handóWhere is the loft window? It was somewhere here?í            

ìThe room was growing dark to him. The world was growing narrow around him. Ilooked around me and saw that the hay and straw had been trampled all over thefloor, as if there had been a struggle there.            

ìëMy sister heard me and ran in. I told her not to come near us until he wasdead. He came in, and first he threw me some pieces of money. Then he struck atme with a whip. But I, though a common peasant, struck him hard enough to makehim draw his sword. Let him break his sword, stained with my peasant blood, intoas many pieces as he can. He drew to defend himself and used all his skill tostab me.í            

ìI had seen a few moments before that the broken sword was lying among thehay. It was a gentlemanís weapon. In another place, an old sword lied on theground. It looked like it had belonged to a soldier.             

ìëNow lift me up, Doctor. Lift me up. Where is he?í            

ìëHe is not here,í I said, supporting the boy. I assumed he was speaking ofthe brother.             

ìëHe! As proud as these nobles are, he is afraid to see me. Where is the manwho was here? Turn my face so I can see him.í            

ìI did so, raising the boyís head against my knee. But with a sudden surge ofstrength, he raised himself up completely. I had to rise too or I could not havesupported him.             

ìëMarquis,í said the boy, turned toward him with his eyes opened wide and hisright hand raised. ëWhen the time comes when all things are answered for, I callyou and your descendants, to the very end of your family line, to answer forthem. I mark you with this cross of blood to show what I do. When the time comeswhen these things are to be answered for, I call your brother, the worst of yourterrible family, to answer for them on his own. I mark him with this cross ofblood to show what I do.í            

ìTwice he put his hand to the wound in his chest and drew a cross in the airwith his finger. He stood for a moment with his finger still raised. As itdropped, he dropped with it, and lied down dead.î             

***            

ìWhen I went back to the bedside of the young woman, I found her screamingexactly as she had been before. I knew that this might go on for many hours andwould probably end with her death.            

ìI gave her the same medicines again and sat at her bedside late through thenight. Her screams never became less piercing. She never stumbled over her wordsor changed their order. She always said, ìMy husband, my father, and my brother!One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.Hush!í            

ìThis went on for twenty-six hours after I had first seen her. I had come andgone twice and was sitting beside her again when she began to weaken. I did whatlittle I could to help her calm down. Soon she sank into a stupor and lied therelike she was dead.             

ìIt was as if the wind and rain had finally stopped after a long, frighteningstorm. I let go of her arms and called the peasant woman to help me adjust herand her torn dress. It was then that I realized that she was newly pregnant, andit was then that I lost what little hope I had of her recovery.             

ìëIs she dead?í asked the marquis, whom I will still call the older brother.He came into the room wearing the boots he had been riding his horse in.             

ìëSheís not dead,í I said. ëBut it is likely that she will die.í            

ìëThese peasantsí bodies are so strong!í he said. He looked down at her withcuriosity.            

ìëThere is great strength in sorrow and despair,í I answered.             

ìAt first he laughed at my words, then he frowned. He moved a chair close tomine with his foot and ordered the peasant woman to leave. He said,quietly:            

ìëDoctor, when I found my brother in this difficult situation with thesebeastly peasants, I suggested that we ask for your help. You have a goodreputation. As a young man who is trying to make his fortune, you are aware ofyour own self-interest. The things that you have seen here are not to be spokenof.í            

ìI listened to the patientís breathing and didnít answer.            

ìëAre you paying attention, Doctor?í             

ìëMonsieur, in my profession, the things said by a patient are always keptsecret,í I said. I was careful with my answer, because I was troubled by what Ihad seen and heard.             

ìIt was so difficult to tell if she was breathing that I carefully felt herpulse and heartbeat. She was alive, but barely. Looking around, I took my seatagain. The brothers were watching me carefully.î             

***            

ìIt is very difficult for me to write. It is so cold, and I am so afraid ofbeing discovered and sent to an underground cell in total darkness, that I mustcut my story short. I am not confusedómy memory is still sharp, and I canremember every word that was spoken between those brothers and me.             

ìShe lasted for a week. Toward the end I could understand a few syllables thatshe said to me if I put my ear close to her lips. She asked me where she was,and I told her. She asked me who I was, and I told her. I asked her for herfamily name, but she wouldnít tell me. She shook her head a little on her pillowand kept her secret, as the boy had done.            

ìI had no chance to ask her any questions until I had told the brothers thatshe was fading fast and would not live another day. Until then, although no onewas ever present with us except for the peasant woman and myself, one of thebrothers had always sat behind the curtain at the head of the bed when I wasthere. When they realized that she was going to die, though, they didnít seem tocare what conversation I had with her. The thought passed through my mind thatit was as if I were dying too.             

ìI always noticed that their pride caused them to resent the fact that theyounger brother, as I call him, had had a swordfight with a peasant, and thatthe peasant was just a boy. The only thing that appeared to bother them was theidea that this was degrading to their family and undignified. Whenever I lookedinto the younger brotherís eyes, I could tell that he strongly disliked me forknowing what I had heard from the boy. He was gentler and more polite to me thanthe older brother was, but I could see this. I also saw that it bothered theolder brother, too.             

ìThe young woman died two hours before midnight. By my watch it was almost theexact time that I had first seen her. I was alone with her when her sad, younghead drooped gently to one side, and all her earthly suffering ended.             

ìThe brothers were waiting in a room downstairs, impatient to ride away. I hadheard them while I was alone at the bedside hitting their boots with theirriding whips and pacing up and down.             

ìIs she finally dead?î asked the older brother when I went in.             

ìëShe is dead,î I said.             

ìëCongratulations, brother,í was what he said as he turned around.             

ìHe had offered me money before, which I had avoided taking. Now he gave me arouleaua stack of coins wrapped in a paper cylinderrouleau of gold. I took it from him but laid it on the table. I had thought about itbefore and had decided not to accept anything from them.             

ìëPlease excuse me,í I said. ëBut I canít accept this under thecircumstances.í            

 ìThey looked at each other but bowed to me as I bowed to them. We parted wayswithout saying another word.î             

***            

ìI am tired, tired, tired. I am worn down by suffering, and I canít read whatI have written with this thin hand of mine.             

ìEarly in the morning, the rouleau had been left at my door in a little boxwith my name written on it. Immediately, I thought anxiously about what I shoulddo. I decided that day to write privately to the minister telling him about thepatients that I had been summoned to help and where I had gone. In other words,I told him everything. I knew what influence certain people had at court andthat nobles were often beyond punishment. I expected that the matter would neverbe heard of, but I wanted to relieve my own mind. I had kept the matter a secretfrom everyone, even my wife, and I decided to say this in the letter. I had nofear of being in any real danger, but I was worried that other people might bein danger if they knew what I knew.             

ìI was very busy that day and couldnít finish my letter than night. I rosemuch earlier than my usual time the next morning to finish it. It was the lastday of the year. The finished the letter was lying in front of me when I wastold that a lady had arrived and was waiting to see me.î             

***            

ìI am growing more and more incapable of finishing the task I have set myself.Itís so cold and so dark. My senses are so dulled and I am so dreadfullyunhappy.             

ìThe lady was young and beautiful but didnít look like she would live long.She was very upset. She told me she was the wife of the Marquis Saint Evremonde.I realized that this was the title by which the boy had addressed the olderbrother, and that this was what the letter E embroidered on thescarf meant. It was clear to me that I had seen the Marquis Saint Evremonde veryrecently.             

ìMy memory is still accurate, but I cannot write down the exact words of ourconversation. I suspect that I am being watched more closely than before, and Idonít know when I might be watched. She had partly suspected and partlydiscovered the main facts of the terrible story and what part her husband hadplayed in it. She knew that I had been brought to help, but she didnít know thatthe girl was dead. She told me that she had hoped to secretly show her a womaníssympathy. She had hoped to keep the wrath of Heaven from her noble family, whichhad long mistreated the suffering commoners.            

ìShe believed there was a younger sister who was still alive, and she wantedmost of all to help the sister. I could only tell her that the sister existed. Iknew nothing beyond that. She had come to me secretly in hopes that I could tellher their name and where they lived. To this day I donít know either.î             

***            

ìThese scraps of paper will get me in trouble. One of them was taken away fromme yesterday, with a warning. I have to finish my story today.             

ìShe was a good, kind lady, and she was not happy in her marriage. How couldshe be! The brother distrusted and disliked her. Everything he did was inopposition to her. She was afraid of him and afraid of her husband, too. When Iled her to the door there was a child in her carriage, a pretty boy between twoand three years old.             

ìëFor his sake, Doctor,í she said, pointing to him and crying, ëI would doeverything I could to make up for this. He will never enjoy his inheritanceotherwise. I have a fear that if no one else pays for this wrong, one day hewill have to pay for it himself. I will make it the first duty of his life togive what little I have left to this wronged family, with the compassion andsympathy of his dead mother. Itís not more than the value of a few jewels, ifthe sister can be discovered.í            

ìShe kissed the boy and caressed him and said, ëItís for your own sake. Youwill be faithful to me, wonít you, little Charles?í The child answered bravely,ëYes!í I kissed her hand and she took him in her arms, and went away caressinghim. I never saw her again.             

ìSince she had mentioned her husbandís name as if she thought I already knewit, I did not add it to my letter. I sealed my letter. I was afraid to give itto anyone else, so I delivered it myself that same day.             

ìIt was December 31st. Near nine oíclock that night a man dressed in blackrang the bell at my gate. He demanded to see me and quietly followed my youngservant, Ernest Defarge, upstairs. When my servant came into the room where Isat with my wifeóoh, my wife, I loved her! My fair young English wife!ówe sawthe man, who was supposed to be waiting at the gate, standing behind him.        

ìHe said that there was an urgent case in the Rue Saint Honore. He said itwouldnít take long. He had a coach waiting.             

ìThe coach brought me here to the Bastille, where I will die. When I was awayfrom the house, a black scarf was tied tightly over my mouth from behind and myarms were pinned. The two brothers crossed the road from a dark corner. Theygestured that I was the man they were looking for. The marquis took the letter Ihad written out of his pocket and showed it to me. He burned it in the light ofthe lantern he was holding and put out the burning ashes with his foot. Theydidnít say a word. I was brought here to my cell. It is like a livinggrave.            

ìIf God had put it in the heart of either of the brothers, in all thesefrightening years, to give me any news of how my wife is doingóeven just to knowif she were alive or deadóI might have thought that God hadnít abandoned them.But now I believe that the mark of the cross that the dying boy had made withhis blood is fatal to them, and that they will not receive His mercy. I,Alexandre Manette, a sad prisoner, do tonight, December 31st, 1767, in myunbearable suffering, denounce the Evremonde brothers and all their descendantsto the last of their family, to the time when these things will be answered for.I denounce them to Heaven and Earth.î            

A terrible sound was heard when the reading of the document had finishedóaneager, hungry, blood-chilling scream. The story called up the most revengefulpassions of the time, and every head in all of France dropped before it.            

There was no need, in front of that tribunal, and with that terrible sound, toshow that the Defarges had hidden that paper and not made it public. That theyhad put it with the other items taken from the Bastille that were paraded aroundand had kept it, waiting for the right time. There was no need to show that thefamily of Evremonde had been hated for a long time by the people of SaintAntoine, and was on the list of people to be executed. There is no man alivewhose virtues would have saved him against such denunciation.            

It was that much worse for Darnay that Dr. Manette, the man who was denouncinghim, was a well-known citizen, his own friend, and the father of his wife. Oneof the hopes of the people was to imitate the questionable virtues of ancienttimes and for people to sacrifice themselves for the good of the public.Therefore, the president said (or else his own head would have been in danger ofbeing cut off) that the good doctor would help the Republic even more bydestroying an obnoxious family of aristocrats, and that he would doubtlesslyglow with joy and pride by making his daughter a widow and her child an orphan.At that, the crowd went wild with excitement and patriotic passion, and therewas not a touch of human sympathy among them.             

ìThe doctor has a lot of influence, does he?î murmured Madame Defarge, smilingto The Vengeance. ìLetís see if you can save him now, Doctor!î            

The crowd roared every time one of the members of the jury voted. Another andanother, roar after roar.             

The vote was unanimous. He was an aristocrat, by family and in his heart. Hewas an enemy of the Republic and an oppressor of the people. They voted to sendhim back to the Conciergerie and executed within the next twenty-fourhours!            

Lucie fainted as the sentence was pronounced, as if she had been struck downdead. But she made no sound. The strong voice inside her reminded her that sheof all people could support Charles in his misery and that she shouldn't add toit. This thought quickly awoke her from the shock.             

The judges had to leave to take part in a public demonstration outdoors, sothe tribunal adjourned. The noise and movement of people leaving the courtroomby various hallways was still going on when Lucie stood and reached out to herhusband. There was nothing in the expression on her face but love andconsolation.             

ìIf I could touch him! If I could embrace him just once! Oh, good citizens,will you have compassion for us?î            

There was only one jailer left, along with two of the four men who had takenhim the night before. Barsad was there, too. The people had all gone outside tothe demonstration in the streets. Barsad suggested to the others, ìLet herembrace him. Itís only for a moment.î They agreed silently and helped her moveover the seats in the hall to a place higher up where Darnay could embrace herby leaning over the dockthe area in a law court where the accused stands during a trialdock.            

ìFarewell, darling. This is the last blessing I will give you. We will meetagain in Heaven, where the weary finally rest!î            

This is what Darnay said to Lucie as he held her to his chest.             

ìI can bear it, my dear Charles. God above supports me. Donít worry about me.Give me a parting blessing for our daughter.î            

ìI send it to her through you. I kiss her by kissing you. I say farewell toher by saying it to you.î            

ìMy husband. No! One moment!î He was pulling himself apart from her. ìWe willnot be separated long. I feel that this will break my heart and that I will diesoon, but I will take care of her while I can. When I die, God will send friendsto take care of her, as He did for me.î            

Her father had followed her. He would have fallen to his knees in front ofboth of them, but Darnay reached out his hand and took hold of him,crying:            

ìNo, no! What have you done that should make you kneel before us? We know nowhow much you struggled before. We know now what you went through when yoususpected my family history and when you learned that it was true. We know nowthe feelings of hatred toward me that you fought against and conquered for thesake of your daughter. We thank you with all our hearts, and all our love andduty. Heaven be with you!î            

Dr. Manetteís only answer was to run his hands through his white hair, thenwring them with a cry of anguish.             

ìIt could not be otherwise,î said Darnay. ìThis was inevitable. It was alwaysuseless to ignore my poor motherís trust that first brought my deadly presencenear you. Good could never come from such evil. A happier end could never comefrom such an unhappy beginning. Take comfort and forgive me. Heaven blessyou!î            

Lucie let go of him as the guards pulled him away. She stood watching him, herhands clasped together in a position of prayer. She had a radiant look on herface and was even smiling comfortingly. As he went out through the prisonersídoor, she turned and put her head lovingly on her fatherís breast, tried tospeak to him, and fell at his feet.             

Then, Sydney Carton came out of the hidden corner from which he had nevermoved and picked her up. Only her father and Mr. Lorry were with her. His armtrembled as he raised her and supported her head, yet there was a manner abouthim that wasnít all pity. There was something proud in him.            

ìShall I take her to a coach? Sheís so light, I won't even feel herweight.î            

He carried her easily to the door and laid her tenderly down in a coach. Herfather and Mr. Lorry got into it, and Carton took his seat beside the driver.        

They arrived at the gate where he had stopped in the dark just a few hoursbefore to wonder which cobblestones Lucie had walked on. He lifted her again andcarried her up the staircase to their apartment. There, he laid her down on acouch, and her daughter and Miss Pross wept over her.             

ìDonít revive her,î he said softly to Miss Pross. ìShe is better offunconscious. She has only fainted.î            

ìOh, Carton, Carton, dear Carton!î cried little Lucie. She jumped up and threwher arms around him passionately, in a burst of grief. ìNow that you have come,I think youíll do something to help Mamma and save Papa! Oh, look at her, dearCarton! Can you, of all the people who love her, stand to see her likethis?î            

He leaned over the child and laid her cheek against his face. He pulled heroff of him gently and looked at her unconscious mother.             

ìBefore I go,î he said, pausing, ìmay I kiss her?î            

They remembered afterward that when he bent down and kissed her face, hemurmured some words. Little Lucie, who was closest to him, told them afterward,and told her grandchildren when she was an old woman, that she heard him say, ìAlife you love.î            

When he had gone into the next room, he turned suddenly toward Mr. Lorry andher father, who were following him. He said to the doctor:            

ìYou had great influence as recently as yesterday, Dr. Manette. At least tryto use it again. These judges and all of these men in power are very friendly toyou. They know very well what you have done, donít they?î            

ìNothing about Charles was hidden from me when he was in prison. I was assuredthat I would definitely save him, and I did.î He answered with great difficultyand very slowly.             

ìTry to use your influence again. There isnít much time between now andtomorrow afternoon, but try.î            

ìI intend to try. I wonít rest for a moment.î            

ìGood. I have known energy like yours to do great things before now, thoughneveróî he added smiling and sighing ìóas great as this. But try! Our life isworth so little when we misuse it. It is worth at least this effort. Our liveswould be worth nothing if it werenít.î            

ìI will go to the prosecutor and the president right away,î said Dr. Manette.ìAnd I will go to the others whom I shouldnít name. I will write too, andóbutwait! There is a celebration in the streets. I wonít be able to reach anyoneuntil itís dark.î            

ìThatís true. Well! It is a desperate hope at best. Itís not much moredesperate if itís delayed until dark. Iíll want to know how you do. Butremember! I don't expect anything. When are you likely to meet with thesepowerful people, Dr. Manette?î            

ìImmediately after dark, I hope. Within an hour or two from now.î            

ìIt will be dark soon after four oíclock. If I go to Mr. Lorryís at nine, willI be able to hear how you have done, either from a friend or fromyourself?î            

ìYes.î            

ìGood luck!î            

Mr. Lorry followed Sydney to the outer door. He touched him on the shoulder ashe was going away, causing him to turn around.             

ìI have no hope,î said Mr. Lorry, in a quiet, sorrowful whisper.             

ìNeither have I.î            

ìIf any one of these men, or even all of these men, wanted to spare himówhichis asking a lot, for what do they care about his life, or any manís life?óIdoubt that they would dare to do it after the way the crowd reacted in thecourtroom today.î            

ìSo do I. I heard the sound of an axe falling in their screams.î            

Mr. Lorry leaned his arm on the doorpost and buried his face in it.             

ìDonít worry,î said Carton very gently. ìDonít grieve. I encouraged Dr.Manette in this idea because I felt that it might one day make Lucie feelbetter. Otherwise, she might think to herself, 'his life was thrown away orwasted,' and that might upset her.î            

ìYes, yes, yes,î answered Mr. Lorry, wiping the tears from his eyes. ìYouíreright. But he will die. There is no real hope.î            

ìYes. He will die. There is no real hope,î repeated Carton.             

And with that, Carton walked confidently downstairs.             

Sydney Carton paused in the street, unsure where to go. ìWeíre meeting atTellsonís Bank at nine oíclock,î he said, thinking it over. ìWould it be good tobe seen in public in the meantime? I think so. Itís best that people know that aman that looks like me is here in Paris. Itís a smart precaution to take, and itmight be necessary to prepare for later. But wait! Let me think it over!î            

He had started walking toward his goal, but now he stopped. He turned aroundonce or twice in the street, which was already growing dark. He thought throughhis plan to see what the possible results might be. His first thought wasconfirmed. ìItís best that these people know that a man that looks like me ishere,î he said, finally deciding. He turned and headed toward Saint Antoine.        

Defarge had described himself that day at the court as the owner of a wineshop in the suburb of Saint Antoine. It wasnít hard for someone who knew thecity well to find his house without asking any questions. Carton found out whereit was and came out of those narrow streets again. He ate dinner at an inn andfell fast asleep after dinner. For the first time in many years, he did notdrink any strong alcohol. Since the night before, he had drunk nothing but alittle light, weak wine, and he had poured his brandy slowly out on Mr. Lorryíshearth like a man who would never drink again.             

It was as late as seven oíclock in the evening when he awoke refreshed andwent out into the streets again. As he walked toward Saint Antoine he stopped ata shop window where there was a mirror. He slightly rearranged the messyappearance of his loose cravata scarf or piece of fabric worn around a manís neck and tied in frontcravat, the collar of his coat, and his wild hair. Havingfinished, he went directly to Defargeís wine shop and went in.             

There were no other customers in the shop besides Jacques Three, the man withthe restless fingers and the rough voice. Jacques Three, whom Carton had seen onthe jury, stood drinking at the little counter. He was talking to Monsieur andMadame Defarge. The Vengeance was also talking with them, like a regular visitorto the shop.             

Carton walked in, took a seat, and asked for a small measure of wine in verypoor French. Madame Defarge glanced at him carelessly. Then she looked closerand closer, and went over to him herself and asked what he had ordered.             

He repeated his order.            

ìAre you English?î Madame Defarge asked, raising her dark eyebrows at himquestioningly.            

After looking at her, as if he had difficulty understanding even a singleFrench word, he answered in a strong English accent, ìYes, Madame. I amEnglish.î            

Madame Defarge went back to the counter to get the wine. Carton picked up ajournal on Jacobinsa political club formed during the French RevolutionJacobins and pretended to read it as if trying to understand it. He heard hersay, ìI swear to you, he looks like Evremonde!î            

Defarge brought him his wine and wished him a good evening.            

ìHow?î Carton asked in poor French.            

ìGood evening.î            

ìOh! Good evening, citizen,î said Carton, filling his glass. ìAh! and goodwine. I toast my glass to the Republic.î            

Defarge went back to the counter. He said, ìHe certainly looks a little likehim.î Madame answered firmly, ìI tell you, he looks a lot like him.î JacquesThree said soothingly, ìYou have been thinking about him so much that you arestarting to see him everywhere, madame.î The Vengeance added, laughing, ìYes!And you are so anxious to see him one last time tomorrow at hisexecution!î            

Carton pretended to work strenuously at reading his paper, following the wordswith his finger. He looked completely absorbed. They were all leaning their armson the counter and were close together, speaking quietly. They all looked at himfor a few moments in silence without distracting him from his Jacobin journal.Then they resumed their conversation.             

ìItís true what Madame Defarge says,î said Jacques Three. ìWhy stop now? Thatmakes a lot of sense. Why stop now?î            

ìWell, well,î reasoned Defarge. ìBut we have to stop somewhere. After all, thequestion is, where do we stop?î            

ìWe stop after they have been exterminated,î said Madame Defarge.             

ìWonderful!î said Jacques Three, hoarsely. The Vengeance also enthusiasticallyapproved.             

ìExtermination is a good policy, my wifeî said Defarge, rather troubled. ìIngeneral I have nothing against it. But Dr. Manette has suffered a great deal.You saw him today. You saw his face when they read the paper he had written inprison.î            

ìI saw his face!î repeated Madame Defarge hatefully and angrily. ìYes. I sawhis face. I see that his face is not the face of a true friend to the Republic.Let him worry about his face!î            

ìAnd you have seen how much his daughter has suffered,î said Defarge to hiswife disapprovingly. ìHer suffering must torture him!î            

ìI have seen his daughter,î repeated Madame Defarge. ìYes, I have seen hisdaughter several times. I saw her today and I have seen her other days. I haveseen her in court and I have seen her in the street by the prison. Let me justraise a fingeróî Carton thought that she raised it, although he never looked upfrom his paper. She let it fall with a rattle on the edge of the counter infront of her, as if it were an axe falling.             

ìMadame Defarge is superb!î said Jacques Three hoarsely.             

ìShe is an angel!í said The Vengeance. She embraced Madame Defarge.             

ìAs far as you are concerned,î continued Madame Defarge unforgivingly to herhusband, ìif it depended on youówhich, fortunately, it does notóyou would rescueDarnay right now.î            

ìNo!î Defarge argued. ìNot even if I could save him just by raising thisglass! But I would end it there. I say we should stop there.î            

ìSee you then, Jacques,î said Madame Defarge wrathfully. ìAnd see you too,Vengeance. Iíll see you both. Listen! I have the Evremonde family on my list forother crimes as tyrants and oppressors. They are doomed to be destroyed andexterminated. Ask my husband if itís true.î            

ìItís true,î Defarge agreed, without being asked.             

ìDefarge found the paper we heard read today in the first days of theRevolution ,when the Bastille fell. He brought it home, and in the middle of thenight, when this shop was empty and closed up, we read it. Right here by thelight of this lamp. Ask him if itís true.î            

ìItís true,î agreed Defarge.             

ìThat night, after we had read through the paper, the lamp had burned out andthe daylight was shining in above those shutters and between those iron bars. Itold him I had a secret to tell him. Ask him if itís true.î            

ìItís true,î agreed Defarge.             

ìI told him my secret. I struck my chest with these two hands as I strike itnow, and I told him, ëDefarge, I was raised by fishermen on the seashore. Thepeasant family harmed so badly by the two Evremonde brothers, as described inthe paper from the Bastille, is my family. Defarge, that sister of the woundedboy who died on the ground was my sister. That husband who was killed was mysisterís husband. That unborn child she carried was their child. That brotherwas my brother. That father was my father. Those dead people are my dead. Theresponsibility to bring the guilty to justice belongs to me!í Ask him if itístrue.î            

ìItís true,î agreed Defarge once more.             

ìThen tell the wind and fire where to stop,î answered Madame Defarge. ìButdonít tell me.î            

Jacques Three and The Vengeance seemed to enjoy hearing the reasons for herwrath, and both praised her highly. Carton could feel how angry she was withoutlooking at her. Defarge was a weak minority in the group. He added a few wordsabout the memory of the compassionate wife of the marquis, but his wife onlyrepeated her last answer. ìTell the wind and fire where to stop, but donít tellme!î            

Customers came into the wine shop and the group split up. Carton paid for hiswine and counted out his change as though French money confused him. He askedfor directions to the National Palace as if he were a stranger to the city.Madame Defarge took him to the door. She put her arm on his as she pointed outthe road. Carton had the thought that he could do a good deed by lifting herarm, stabbing her in her side, and killing her.            

Instead, he went on his way, and he was soon standing in the shadow of theprison wall. At nine oíclock, he left and went to Mr. Lorryís room again, wherehe found him pacing anxiously back and forth in restless anxiety. He said he hadbeen with Lucie until just recently, and that he had only left her for a fewminutes to come and keep his appointment. Dr. Manette hadnít been seen since heleft the bank just before four oíclock. Lucie had some faint hope that thedoctor could intervene and save Charles, but that hope was small. He had beengone for more than five hours. Where could he be?            

Mr. Lorry waited until ten oíclock, and Dr. Manette still hadnít returned. Hedidnít want to leave Lucie alone any longer, so they decided he would go back toLucie and return to the bank again at midnight. In the meantime, Carton wouldwait for the doctor alone by the fire.             

Carton waited and waited. The clock struck twelve, and Dr. Manette had stillnot come back. Mr. Lorry returned and learned that no one had heard from thedoctor. He had brought no news of him either. Where could he be?            

They were discussing this question, and were starting to believe his absencemight mean he'd had some success, when they heard him coming up the stairs. Assoon as he entered the room, it was obvious that there was no hope.             

They never learned whether he had really been to see anyone or whether he hadbeen out walking the streets the whole time. He stood there staring at them, andthey didnít ask him any questions. The expression on his face told themeverything.             

ìI canít find it,î he said. ìAnd I need it. Where is it?î            

His head and throat were bare. He looked around the room distractedly as hespoke, took his coat off, and let it drop on the floor.             

ìWhere is my bench? Iíve been looking everywhere for my bench, and I canítfind it. What have they done with the shoes I was working on? Iím running out oftime. I must finish those shoes.î            

Carton and Mr. Lorry looked at each other, devastated.             

ìCome, come!î he said, whimpering miserably. ìLet me get to work. Give me mywork.î            

When he didnít get an answer he tore at his hair and pounded his feet on thefloor like an angry child.             

ìDonít torture a poor, sad wretch,î he begged them, screaming. ìGive me mywork! What will happen to us if I donít finish those shoes tonight?î            

All was lost!             

It was clear that there was no point in reasoning with him or trying to revivehim. Carton and Mr. Lorry both put a hand on his shoulder as if they had agreedto do so. They told him soothingly to sit down in front of the fire, and theypromised him that he would have his work soon. He sank into the chair, staringinto the embers, and started to cry. It was as if everything that had happenedsince he had been making shoes in the attic in Saint Antoine had been a dream.Mr. Lorry saw the doctor shrink into the exact same man that Defarge had kept athis shop.             

Carton and Mr. Lorry were both terrified to see him in such horrible shape,but it wasnít the time to give in to such emotions. They both thought of Lucie.She had now lost the only person whom she could rely on and who could give herhope. Again, as if they had agreed to do so, they looked at each other and knewwhat they needed to do. Carton spoke first:            

ìWe have lost our last chance. It wasnít much. Yes. We had better take Dr.Manette to see Lucie. But before you go, will you listen to me for a moment?Donít ask me why I demand the conditions I am about to make, or why I demand thepromise I am going to ask. I have a good reason.î            

ìIím sure that you do,î answered Mr. Lorry. ìGo on.î            

Dr. Manette was rocking back and forth and moaning the whole time as he sat ina chair between them. They spoke quietly, as if they were sitting by a patientíssickbed at night.             

Carton bent over to pick up the coat. It lay on the floor and was almostwrapped around his feet. As he did so, a small case in which the doctor carriedhis list of the dayís duties fell on the floor. Carton picked it up, and therewas a folded paper in it. ìWe should look at this!î he said. Mr. Lorry nodded inagreement. He opened it and exclaimed, ìThank God!î            

ìWhat is it? ì Mr. Lorry asked anxiously.            

ìGive me a moment. Let me talk about it in context.î He put his hand in hiscoat pocket and took out another piece of paper. ìThis is a certificate thatallows me to leave Paris. Look at it. You see? It says, ëSydney Carton, anEnglishman.íî            

Mr. Lorry held it open in his hand and looked at Cartonís face.             

ìHold onto it for me until tomorrow. You remember that I am going to go seeDarnay tomorrow. I'd better not bring it with me into the prison.î            

ìWhy not?î            

ìI donít know. Iíd prefer not to. Now, take this paper that Dr. Manette hasbeen carrying with him. It is a similar certificate, which allows Lucie and herdaughter to cross the barrier out of Paris at any time. You see?î            

ìYes!î            

ìPerhaps he got it as his last safety measure yesterday. When is it dated? Itdoesnít matter. Donít stay to look. Tuck it away carefully with my certificateand your own. Now, look! I never doubted until the past hour or two that he had,or could get, a paper like this. It is valid until it is revoked, but it may berevoked soon, and I have reason to think that it will be.î             

ìThey are not in danger?î            

ìThey are in great danger. They are in danger of being accused by MadameDefarge. I heard it from her own lips. I have overheard things she said tonightthat make it clear they are in great danger. I didnít waste time. I went to seeBarsad right away, and he confirmed it for me. He knows that a wood sawyer wholives by the prison wall is under the influence of Monsieur and Madame Defarge.They have told him to say that he has seen 'her'óhe never mentioned Lucieísnameómaking signs and signals to the prisoners. Itís easy to see that they willmake the usual claimóthat she is involved in a prison plot. They will accuseLucie, and possibly her daughter and her father, since they have all been seenthere. Donít look so horrified. You will save all of them.î            

ìI hope to Heaven that I will, Carton. But how?î            

ìI will tell you how. It will depend on you, and there is no better man thanyou to depend on. This new accusation will certainly not take place until aftertomorrow, probably not until two or three days afterward. Itís more likely thatit will be a week afterward. You know it is a capital crime to mourn for orsympathize with someone who is executed at the guillotine, so she and her fatherwill without a doubt be guilty of this crime. Madame Defarge, who will stop atnothing, will add that accusation to her case and make sure that they areconvicted. You follow me?î            

ìIím listening so closely, and with so much confidence that what you say istrue, that for the moment I have even forgotten about this problem,î Mr. Lorrysaid, touching the back of the doctorís chair.             

ìYou have money. You can pay for the quickest possible means of travel to theseacoast. You made plans to return to England some days ago. Have your horsesmade ready early tomorrow so that they can leave at two oíclock in theafternoon.î            

ìI will do it!î            

Carton was so passionate and inspiring that it made Mr. Lorry as eager as ayoung man.             

ìYou are a good man. Did I say that there is no better man we could depend on?Tell Lucie tonight about the danger you know regarding her child and father.Focus on that, because she would happily die along with her husband.î Hehesitated for a moment and then continued on as before. ìTell her that, for thesake of her child and father, she needs to leave Paris with her daughter, herfather, and you at that time. Tell her it was the last arrangement her husbandmade. Tell her that more depends on it than she would dare believe or hope. Youthink that her father, even as disturbed as he is, will go with her, donítyou?î            

ìIím sure of it.î            

ìI thought so. Make these arrangements quietly and quickly in the courtyardoutside. You should even go so far as to already be sitting in the carriage. Themoment I come to you, take me into the carriage and drive away.î            

ìI should wait for you under any circumstances, yes?î            

ìYou have my travel certificate in your hand with the others, you know, andwill save my place. Wait for nothing else except to have my place in thecarriage filled, then leave for England!î            

ìWhy, then,î said Mr. Lorry, grasping his eager, steady hand, ìit doesnít alldepend on me, an old man. I will have a strong, young man by my side helpingme.î            

ìWith Heavenís help you will! Promise me that nothing will make you change theplan that we have agreed on.î            

ìNothing, Carton.î            

ìRemember this conversation tomorrow. If you change the plan, or delay for anyreason, no oneís life can possibly be saved, and many lives will besacrificed.î            

ìI will remember it. I hope to do my part faithfully.î            

ìAnd I hope to do mine. Now, goodbye!î            

Though he said it with a sincere smile and even kissed Mr. Lorryís hand, hedidnít leave him yet. He helped him get Dr. Manette, who was rocking back andforth in front of the dying embers in the fireplace, to his feet. They helpedhim put a cloak and a hat on, and they lured him outside by telling him thatthey were looking for the hidden bench and shoes that he was crying out for.Carton walked on the other side of the doctor and protected him as they walkedthrough the courtyard of the Manetteís house. Lucie was there. She was so sadnow, and she had been so happy back when Carton had told her of his feelings forher. Carton entered the courtyard and remained there for a few minutes alone,looking up at the light coming from her window. Before he went away, he said ablessing for her and said goodbye.             

In the dark prison of the Conciergerie, the condemned prisoners waited to beexecuted. The number of condemned prisoners was the same as the number of weeksin a year. Fifty-two people were to be carted through the city streets to theirdeaths, and new prisoners were assigned to their cells before they had even leftthem. Before the condemned were killed, the next round of condemned prisonershad already been named.             

Fifty-two names were read out: from the seventy-year-old farmer-general whosewealth couldnít save him, to the twenty-year-old seamstress, whose poverty andinsignificance couldnít save her. Sickness caused by immoral behavior andself-neglect will infect people of any social class. The frightening moralsickness that came from unspeakable suffering, oppression, and heartless apathyalso struck down its victims regardless of their position in life.             

Charles Darnay was alone in a cell. He had no delusions about being savedsince he came to the cell from the tribunal. He knew that every word of thestory he had heard condemned him to death. He had fully understood that nopersonís influence could possibly save him. It was as if all the millions ofpeople of France had pronounced his sentence, so one person alone could donothing to help him.             

Nevertheless, it wasnít easy to prepare his mind for his coming death. He keptpicturing his beloved wifeís face. He had many reasons to live, and it was hardto let go. When he let go of one reason to live, another made him want to holdon tighter. When he came to terms with that and let go a little, the other wouldtighten. His thinking was rushed, too, and his heart beat rapidly, workingagainst his acceptance of death. If he were able to come to terms with death fora moment, the thought of his wife and child, who would have to go on livingwithout him, would make him feel that he was being selfish.             

But this only happened at first. Before long he had the thought that there wasno shame in dying this way. The thought that many innocent people died the sameway and faced it bravely every day made him feel better. He realized that he hadto face death with quiet strength if he wanted his family to have any peace ofmind in the future. Little by little he calmed down to a state where he couldthink happier thoughts and take some comfort.             

This was his state of mind before it had grown dark on the night Darnay wascondemned. He was allowed to buy a light and some things to write with, and hesat down to write until the time when the prison lamps had to be put out.        

He wrote a long letter to Lucie and told her that he hadnít known anythingabout her fatherís imprisonment until she had told him herself. He told her hedidnít know anything about his fatherís and uncleís roles in that imprisonmentuntil Dr. Manetteís paper had been read. He had already explained to her that hehad hidden his real name from her because it was the one condition that herfather had made when he agreed to let them be married. It made sense now, andthe doctor had held him to this promise on the morning of their marriage. Hebegged her, for her fatherís sake, never to try to find out if her father hadforgotten about the existence of the paper, or if he had remembered it afterDarnay told the story about the Tower of London that Sunday long ago under theplane tree in the garden. If he had remembered any of it, he surely would haveassumed it had been destroyed when the Bastille fell, since he had not heard itmentioned with the other belongings that people had found there and told theworld about. He begged heróthough he added that he knew asking wasnítnecessaryóto comfort her father by letting him know in every way she could thinkof that he hadnít done anything he should blame himself for. He had forgottenall about it for both of their sakes. Next, as they would one day meet inHeaven, he begged her to preserve the memory of his love for her, to overcomeher sorrow, and to devote herself to their child and to comforting her father.        

He wrote a similar letter to Dr. Manette, telling the doctor specifically thathe left Lucie and their daughter in his care. He was very adamant about this andhoped this responsibility would lift him out of any hopelessness or dangerousreflection that Darnay thought he might fall into.             

He wrote to Mr. Lorry and told him to take care of all of them. He alsoexplained all his personal and business affairs. After that was done, he thankedhim for his friendship and affection. Then he was done. He never thought aboutMr. Carton. He was so focused on the others that he didnít even think of himonce.             

He had time to finish these letters before the lamps were all put out. When helied down on his straw bed, he thought that his life was over.             

But his life came back to him while he slept, and showed itself in happymemories. He saw himself free and happy back in the old house in Soho (though ithad nothing in it that looked like the interior of the real house). He wascompletely free and lighthearted, with Lucie again. She told him it was all adream and he had never left London. He slept without dreaming for a while, andthen he dreamt he had been killed and had come back to her, dead and at peace,and yet he had not changed at all. He slept without dreaming again for a while,and he woke up in the morning. He didnít know where he was or what had happened,until it flashed in his mind, ìThis is the day I am going to die.î            

This is how he spent the hours leading up to the day when fifty-two peoplewere to have their heads cut off. He was calm now and hoped that he could facehis death with quiet bravery. But a new idea came to him that made this verydifficult to do.             

He had never seen the guillotine before. He hadnít seen how high it was offthe ground, how many steps it had, or where he would stand. He didnít know howthe executioner would treat him or whether the executionerís hands would bestained with blood. He didnít know which way his face would be turned or whetherhe would be the first person or the last person to die that day. These and manysimilar questions forced their way into his mind over and over again. Theywerenít connected with any feelings of fear fear. He wasnít aware of beingafraid at all. Instead, they came from wanting to know what to do when the timecame. His worry was greatly out of proportion with the few quick moments that hewould actually be there. It was like another spirit inside of him other than hisown was wondering about this.            

The hours passed as he paced back and forth, and the clocks struck numbers hewould never hear again: nine gone forever, ten gone forever, eleven goneforever, and twelve was on its way. After struggling hard with this strange,disturbing thought, he got the better of it. He paced up and down, softlyrepeating his loved onesí names to himself. The worst of his suffering was over.He could walk up and down, free from distracting thoughts, praying for himselfand for them.            

Twelve oíclock came and was gone forever.             

He had been told that three oíclock was the hour for the executions. He knewhe would be brought out sometime before that, since the tumbrils of condemnedprisoners moved through the streets very slowly. Therefore, he decided to thinkof two oíclock as the important hour, so he could strengthen himself in themeantime and after that time focus on strengthening others.             

Walking back and forth with his arms folded on his chest, he was a verydifferent man from the prisoner who had walked back and forth at La ForcePrison. He heard the clock strike one without surprise. The hour had gone pastlike most other hours. He was thankful to Heaven that he had control of himselfagain. He thought, ìThere is just one more hour to go,î and he turned andcontinued walking back and forth again.             

He heard footsteps in the stone passageway outside the door and stopped.        

A key turned in the lock in the door. Before the door opened, or as it wasbeing opened, a man said quietly in English, ìHe has never seen me here. I havekept out of his way. Go in alone. Iíll wait nearby. Donít waste anytime!î            

The door was quickly opened and closed, and Sydney Carton was standing infront of him, face-to-face. He was quiet and looking at him intently, smilingwith his finger to his lips.             

There was something so cheerful and unusual about his expression that at firstDarnay thought he was imagining things. But then Carton spoke, and it wasCartonís real voice. He took Darnayís hand, and Darnay could feel his realgrasp.             

ìOf all the people on earth, am I the last person you expected to see?î hesaid.             

ìI couldnít believe it was you. I can hardly believe it now.î Darnay wassuddenly worried. ìYou arenít a prisoner, are you?î             

ìNo. I happen to have some power over one of the guards here. Thatís why I amstanding here in front of you. Your wife sent me, my dear Darnay.î            

Darnay shook his hand.            

ìI bring a request from her.î            

ìWhat is it?î            

ìItís a serious, urgent request. She sends it to you in the most pathetictones of her voice that you love so much and remember so well.î            

Darnay turned his face to the side.            

ìThereís no time to ask me why I bring it or what it means. I donít have timeto tell you. You must agree to it. Take off your boots and put on mine.î            

Carton was as quick as lightning. There was a chair against the wall of thecell behind Darnay, and he had already moved forward and pushed Darnay into it.He stood over him, barefoot.             

ìPut on my boots. Grab them and put them on. Quickly!î            

ìCarton, there is no way to escape this place. It will never work. You willonly be killed along with me. This is crazy.î            

ìIt would be crazy if I asked you to escape. But do I? If I ask you to go outthat door and try to escape, tell me itís crazy and stay here. Exchange cravatsand coats with me. While you do it, let me take this ribbon out of your hair.Shake out your hair so it looks like mine!î            

Very quickly and with a physical strength and a mental focus that seemedsupernatural, Carton made him do all these things. Darnay was like a young childin his hands.             

ìCarton! Dear Carton! Itís crazy. It canít be done. It will never work. Peoplehave tried to escape and have always failed. I beg you! Donít get yourselfkilled, too.î             

ìDo I ask you, Darnay, to go out the door? When I ask that, you can refuse.Thereís a pen, ink, and paper on this table. Is your hand steady enough for youto write?î            

ìIt was when you came in.î            

ìSteady it again and write down what I say. Quickly, my friend!î            

Darnay grabbed his head with his hand in confusion and sat down at the table.Carton had his right hand on his breast pocket. He stood close beside him.        

ìWrite exactly what I say.î            

ìTo whom should I address it?î            

ìTo no one.î Carton still had his hand in his breast pocket.             

ìShould I date it?î            

ìNo.î            

Darnay looked up when he asked each question. When he did, Carton looked downfrom where he was standing. He still had his hand in his breast pocket.             

ìëIf you remember what we said to each other long ago, you will understandthis when you read it,íî Carton dictated. ìëYou do remember it, I know. It isnot in your nature to forget it.íî            

He was pulling his hand out of his breast pocket. Darnay happened to look upquickly as he wrote. Cartonís hand stopped and grabbed hold of something.            

ìHave you written ëforget ití yet?î asked Carton.            

ìI have. Is that a weapon in your hand?î            

ìNo. I am unarmed.î            

ìWhatís in your hand?î            

ìYou will know very soon. Keep writing. There are only a few words more.î Hedictated again. ìëI am thankful that the time has come when I can prove them tobe true. The fact that I am doing it shouldnít make you regret it or grieve.íîAs he said these words, he looked at Darnay. His hand slowly and gently moveddown close to Darnayís face.             

Darnay dropped the pen onto the table and looked around him, dazed.             

ìWhat is that vapor?î he asked.             

ìVapor?î            

ìDid I inhale something?î            

ìIím not aware of anything. There canít be anything here. Pick up the pen andfinish. Hurry, hurry!î            

It was as if Darnayís memory were failing or his senses were dulled. He triedhard to stay focused. As he looked at Carton with blurred vision and shortenedbreath, Carton looked back at him steadily. His hand was in his breast pocketagain.             

ìHurry, hurry!î            

Darnay bent over the paper again.            

ìëIf it had been otherwiseóíî Cartonís hand was carefully moving towardDarnayís face again ìëóI never would have used the great opportunity.íî Cartoníshand was at Darnayís face again. ìëIf it had been otherwise, I would have hadmuch more to lose. If it had been otherwiseóíî Carton looked at the pen and sawthat his writing was trailing off into meaningless scribble.             

Carton didnít move his hand back to his breast pocket anymore. Darnay jumpedup with an accusing look, but Carton was holding his hand firmly up to hisnostrils. Cartonís left arm caught him around the waist, and for a few secondsDarnay tried to fight with Carton, who had come to lay down his life for him.But within a minute or so, Darnay was stretched out on the ground, unconscious.        

Quickly, but with sure hands and a sure heart, Carton dressed himself in theclothes Darnay had laid aside. He combed back his hair and tied it with theribbon Darnay had been wearing. Then he called quietly, ìEnter there! Come in!îBarsad came in.            

ìYou see?î said Carton, looking up. He kneeled on one knee beside theunconscious Darnay. He put the paper into his breast pocket. ìAre you in greatdanger of getting in trouble?î            

ìMr. Carton,î answered Barsad, snapping his fingers timidly, ìthis businessdoesnít put me in danger if you stay true to your side of the deal.î            

ìDonít be afraid of me. I will be true until my death.î            

ìYou have to be, Mr. Carton, if fifty-two people are to die. If you go throughwith it dressed like that, I shall have nothing to fear.î            

ìHave no fear! I will soon be dead and wonít be able to hurt you. Everyoneelse, God willing, will soon be far away. Now, get help and take me to thecoach.î            

ìYou?î asked Barsad, nervously.            

ìHim, man, whom I have changed places with. Do you go out at the same gate youbrought me in through?î            

ìOf course.î            

ìTell them I was weak and faint when you brought me in and I am fainter nowthat you are taking me out. Tell them my final conversation with Darnay was toomuch for me. Such a thing has happened here oftenótoo often. Your life is inyour own hands. Quick! Call for help!î            

ìYou swear not to betray me?î said Barsad, trembling as he paused for amoment.             

ìMan, man!î answered Carton, stamping his foot. ìHavenít I already sworn asolemn vow to go through with this? Why are you wasting precious time now? Takehim to the courtyard you know of and put him in the carriage yourself. Show himto Mr. Lorry and tell Mr. Lorry he only needs some fresh air to revive him. Tellhim to remember what I said and the promise he made last night. Then tell him todrive away!î            

Barsad left and Carton sat down at the table. He rested his forehead on hishands. Barsad returned immediately with two men.             

ìWhat happened?î asked one of them, looking at the man who had fallen down.ìHeís troubled to find out that his friend is being sent to theguillotine?î            

ìA good patriot could hardly have been more upset if this nobleman had beenreleased.î            

They picked up the unconscious man and put him on the stretcher they hadbrought to the door. They bent down to carry it away.             

ìWeíre running out of time, Evremonde,î Barsad said to Carton in a warningvoice.            

ìI know,î answered Carton. ìPlease take care of my friend and leave mealone.î            

ìCome on, boys,î said Barsad. ìLift him up and come this way.î            

The door closed, and Carton was left alone. He strained to hear any soundsthat might show that they were suspicious. There were none. He heard keysturning, doors slamming shut, and footsteps walking along hallways in thedistance. He didnít hear anything unusual, like people yelling or rushingaround. He breathed easier for a little while. He sat down at the table andlistened again until the clock struck two.             

Then he heard sounds, but he wasnít afraid of them because he knew what theymeant. Several doors opened one after another, and finally his own door opened.A jailer with a list in his hand looked inside. All he said was, ìFollow me,Evremonde!î Carton followed him into a large, dark room that was far away. Itwas a dark winter day. The shadows inside and outside made it difficult to seethe other people who were brought there to have their arms tied. Some werestanding up and some were seated. A few of them were crying and some were movingaround nervously. But most of them were silent and still, staring at the ground.        

He stood by the wall in a dark corner while some of the fifty-two others werebrought in after him. One man stopped to embrace him as he passed by as if heknew him. Carton felt terrified he would be found out, but the man continued on.A few moments later a young woman got up from where he had seen her sitting andcame over to speak to him. She had a small, girlish figure, a beautiful paleface, and large, widely opened patient eyes.             

ìCitizen Evremonde,î she said, touching him with her cold hand. ìI am a poorseamstress. I was with you in La Force Prison.î            

He murmured, ìThatís right. I forgetówhat were you accused of?î            

ìPlots. Though Heaven knows that I am innocent. Is it likely? Who would thinkof plotting with a poor, little weak creature like me?î            

She smiled sadly when she said it, and he was so touched that he started totear up.            

ìI am not afraid to die, Citizen Evremonde. But I havenít done anything wrong.I am not unwilling to die if the Republic, which will do so much good for poorpeople like me, will benefit from my death. But I donít know how that can be,Citizen Evremonde. Iím such a poor, weak, little creature!î            

He was moved by this poor girl, and she was the last thing on earth that wouldmove him.             

ìI heard you were released, Citizen Evremonde. I hoped it was true.î            

ìIt was. But I was arrested again and condemned to die.î            

ìIf I can ride in the same cart as you, Citizen Evremonde, will you let mehold your hand? Iím not afraid, but I am little and weak and it will give memore courage.î            

As the girl looked up into his face, he saw that she suddenly doubted whetherhe was actually who he said. She looked astonished, and he kissed her youngfingers, which were worn from years of poverty.             

ìAre you dying for him?î she whispered.            

ìAnd for his wife and child. Hush! Yes. I am dying for him.î            

ìOh, will you let me hold your hand, brave stranger?î            

ìHush! Yes, my dear. To the very end.î            

***            

The same shadows that were falling on the prison were falling on the barrierat that same time in the early afternoon. There was a crowd around it, and acoach on its way out of Paris drove up to it to be questioned.             

ìWho goes there?î said the guard. ìWhom do you have inside? Show us yourpapers!î            

The people inside the coach handed the guard the papers and he read them.        

ìAlexandre Manette. Doctor. French. Which one is he?î            

They pointed out the confused old man. He was mumbling incoherently.             

ìApparently the citizen doctor is not in his right mind? The Revolution feverwas too much for him?î            

It was far too much for him.             

ìHa! Many people suffer from it,î said the guard. He read from thecertificate: ìLucie. His daughter. French.î Which one is she?î he asked.             

They pointed her out.             

ìIt must be. Lucie. Sheís Evremondeís wife, isnít she?î            

ìShe is,î they answered.            

ìHa! Evremonde has a date elsewhere. Lucie, her child, English,î he read.ìThis is she?î            

This is she.             

ìKiss me, daughter of Evremonde,î the guard said to her. ìNow you have kisseda good Republican. Thatís something new to your family. Remember it! SydneyCarton. Lawyer. English,î the guard read. ìWhich one is he?î            

He was lying in a corner of the carriage. They pointed him out too.             

ìApparently the English lawyer has fainted?î            

ìWe hope he will recover from the fresh air. He isnít well and is upset to beseparated from a friend who has angered the Republic.î            

ìIs that all? Thatís no big deal! Many have angered the Republic and must lookout of the little windows of the prisons. Jarvis Lorry. Banker. English,î readthe guard. ìWhich one is he?î            

ìI am he, of course, since I am the only other person here.î            

It was Jarvis Lorry who had answered all the previous questions. It was JarvisLorry who got out and stood with his hand on the coach door, answering the groupof officials. The guards slowly walked around the carriage and climbed up on topto look at what little luggage there was on the roof. The country people werehanging around, pressing nearer to the coach doors and staring into it greedily.A small child in its motherís arms was reaching out so that it could touch thewife of an aristocrat who had been killed by the guillotine.             

ìHere are your papers, Jarvis Lorry. They have been signed andapproved.î            

ìWe can leave, citizen?î            

ìYou can leave. Move forward, postilionsa person riding one of the horses in a team drawing a carriagepostilions! Have a good journey!î            

ìThank you, citizens!...And we have passed the first threat.î            

Again it was Jarvis Lorry who said these words. He clasped his hands togetherand looked up. People in the carriage were terrified and crying, and theunconscious traveler was breathing heavily.             

ìArenít we going too slowly? Canít we make them go faster?î asked Lucie,clinging to her father.             

ìIt would look like we were running away if we did. We canít make them go toofast. It would look suspicious.î            

ìLook back and see if they are chasing us!î            

ìThe road is empty, my dear. So far they are not chasing us.î            

They passed houses in groups of twos and threes, lonely farms, ruins ofbuildings, dye works, tanneries, and such. They passed open fields and rows ofleafless trees. The road was made of hard, uneven pavement, and there was soft,deep mud on either side. Sometimes they would drive into the mud to avoid thestones that clattered and shook the carriage. Sometimes they got stuck intrenches and marshes. This would make them so wildly impatient that they wouldwant to get out and run or hideóanything but stop.             

They left the open fields and were again surrounded by ruined buildings,farms, dye works, tanneries, and such. They saw more cottages in groups of twosand threes and more rows of leafless trees. ìHave these men tricked us?î theywondered. ìAre they taking us back to Paris by another road? Isnít this the sameplace that we have passed twice before? Thank Heaven, no. Thereís a village.Look back and see if they are following us! Hush. Thereís a posting house.î        

Slowly the four horses were unharnessed. The coach stood casually in thelittle street without its horses, looking like it would never move again. Slowlythe new horses came into view one by one, and slowly the new postilions followedthem, sucking and weaving the lashes of their whips. Slowly the old postilionscounted their money, add the numbers incorrectly, and become dissatisfied withtheir pay. All this time, the anxious hearts of the travelers were beatingfaster than the fastest horses that were ever born could gallop.            

After a while the new postilions got into their saddles and the old ones wereleft behind. They went through the village, up and down a hill and onto the low,watery grounds. Suddenly, the postilions stopped speaking and started gesturingto each other wildly. The horses were pulled quickly to a stop. Were they beingfollowed?            

ìHo! You inside the carriage. Speak!î            

ìWhat is it?î asked Mr. Lorry, looking out the window.             

ìHow many did they say?î            

ìI donít understand you.î            

ìAt the last post. How many did they say were sent to the guillotinetoday?î            

ìFifty-two.î            

ìThatís what I said! A good number. My fellow citizen here said it wasforty-two. There are ten more people than that who deserve to have their headscut off today. The guillotine works well. I love it.î Then he yelled at thehorses, ìForward! Whoop!î            

The night turned dark, and the unconscious traveler started to move more. Hewas beginning to wake up and to speak understandably again. He thought he wasstill together with Mr. Carton. He called Carton by his name and asked him whathe had in his hand. Oh, take pity on them, Heaven, and help them! Look out andsee if they are being chased.            

The wind is chasing them. The clouds are flying after them. The moon isfalling and the night is chasing them. But so far, nothing else is chasing them.        

While the fifty-two prisoners waited to be executed, Madame Defarge held adarkly ominous meeting with The Vengeance and Jacques Three of the Revolutionaryjury. She didnít meet with them at the wine shop but in the shed of the woodsawyer, who used to be a repairer of roads. The wood sawyer himself did not takepart in the meeting. He waited a little distance away, like an outsider whowasnít supposed to speak until he was needed or asked his opinion.            

ìBut Monsieur Defarge is a good Republican without a doubt, isnít he?î askedJacques Three.             

ìThere isnít a better Republican in France,î the talkative Vengeance said inher shrill voice.             

ìQuiet, Vengeance,î said Madame Defarge. She frowned and put her hand on TheVengeanceís lips. ìListen to me. My husband is a good Republican and a braveman. He deserves to be treated well by the Republic, and the government isconfident in him. But my husband has his weaknesses. He is so weak that he willside with Dr. Manette.î            

ìItís a great pity,î said Jacques Three hoarsely, shaking his head in doubt.His fingers were at his hungry mouth. ìHe is not acting like a good citizen.Itís unfortunate.î            

ìLook,î said Madame Defarge. ìI donít care about this doctor at all. He canlive or die as far as I care. It doesnít matter to me. But the Evremonde familyhas to die out, and the wife and child must die like their husband andfather.î            

ìShe has a good head for it,î answered Jacques Three hoarsely. ìI have seensomeone with blue eyes and blond hair beheaded. The head looked beautiful whenthe executioner held it up.î He was such a monster that he spoke the way agourmet talks about food.             

Madame Defarge looked down and thought a little.            

ìThe child also has blond hair and blue eyes,î said Jacques Three,thoughtfully enjoying his words. ìWe rarely have a child sent to the guillotine.Itís a pretty sight!î            

ìIn a word,î said Madame Defarge, getting back onto the subject, ìI caníttrust my husband about this. Since last night Iíve felt that I canít trust himwith the details of my plans. I also feel that if I delay he could warn them,and then they might escape.î            

ìThat must never happen,î said Jacques Three hoarsely. ìNo one must escape. Wedonít have enough people dying as it is. We should have a hundred and twentypeople sent to the guillotine every day.î            

ìIn a word,î Madame Defarge continued, ìmy husband doesnít have my reason forwanting to exterminate the Evremonde family, and I donít have his reason forhaving any affection for Dr. Manette. Therefore, I must act for myself. Comehere, little citizen.î            

The wood sawyer, who was deathly afraid of Madame Defarge, came forwardclutching his red cap.             

ìAbout those signals that she made to the prisoners, little citizen,î saidMadame Defarge sternly. ìAre you ready to swear to them today?î            

ìYes, yes. Why not?î cried the wood sawyer. ìEvery day, in any weather, fromtwo to four oíclock, she was always signaling. Sometimes she came with herdaughter; sometimes she did not. I know what I know. I saw it with my owneyes.î            

He made all sorts of gestures as he spoke, as if he were imitating a few ofthe different signals that he had never actually seen Lucie make.             

ìClearly they were forming plots,î said Jacques Three. ìIt couldnít be moreclear!î            

ìCan we be sure the jury will convict her?î asked Madame Defarge. She lookedat him with a gloomy smile.             

ìYou can count on the patriotic jury, citizeness. I speak for my fellowjurymen.î            

ìNow, let me see,î said Madame Defarge, thinking it over again. ìLet me thinkit over just once more. Can I let this doctor live for my husbandís sake? Idonít care either way. Can I spare him?î            

ìHe would be one more head,î said Jacques Three quietly. ìWe really donít haveenough heads as it is. It would be a pity to let him live, I think.î            

 ìHe was signaling to the prisoners with Lucie when I saw her,î argued MadameDefarge. ìI canít accuse one without accusing the other, and I canít keep quietand put the whole case in this little citizenís hands,î she said, pointing tothe wood sawyer. ìIím not a bad witness.î            

The Vengeance and Jacques Three both tried to outdo each other in saying thatshe was the most admirable and marvelous witness. The little wood sawyer didnítwant to be outdone and called her a celestial witness.            

ìHe must take his chances,î said Madame Defarge. ìNo, I cannot spare him. Youare busy at three oíclock. You are going to see the people who are to beexecuted today. You?î            

She asked this to the wood sawyer. He hurriedly said yes and took thisopportunity to say that he was a passionate Republican and that he would be thesaddest of Republicans if anything stopped him from enjoying the pleasure ofsmoking his afternoon pipe while watching people killed at the guillotine. Hewas so passionate about it that he might have been suspected of fearing for hisown personal safety at all times, and perhaps Madame Defarge did suspect him asshe looked at him angrily with her dark eyes.            

ìI will be doing the same thing there,î said madame. ìAfter itís overóletíssay at eight oíclock tonightócome to see me in Saint Antoine and we will goaccuse these people at my Section.î            

The wood sawyer said he would be proud and flattered to go with MadameDefarge. Madame Defarge looked at him, and he became embarrassed. He avoided herlook as if he were a small dog and hid his confusion by returning to sawingwood.             

Madame Defarge beckoned to Jacques Three and The Vengeance to come closer tothe door, and then she elaborated on her thoughts:            

ìShe will be at home now, waiting for him to be executed, mourning andgrieving. She will want to accuse the Republic of injustice, and she will besympathetic with the enemies of the Republic. I will go see her.î            

ìYou are an admirable woman! I adore you!î yelled Jacques Threeenthusiastically. ìAh, my cherished!î cried The Vengeance, embracing her.        

ìTake my knitting,î said Madame Defarge, giving it to The Vengeance. ìHave itwaiting for me at my usual seat near the guillotine. Save my usual chair for me.Go right now, for there will probably me a bigger crowd than usual theretoday.î            

ìI will follow my chiefís orders,î said The Vengeance eagerly. She kissedMadame Defarge on the cheek. ìYou wonít be late?î            

ìIíll be there before they begin.î            

ìAnd before the tumbrils arrive with the prisoners. Make sure that you arethere before the tumbrils arrive!î The Vengeance called after her, but MadameDefarge had already stepped out into the street.            

Madame Defarge slightly waved her hand to show that she had heard her andcould be counted on to arrive on time. Then she walked through the mud andaround the corner of the prison wall. The Vengeance and Jacques Three watchedher as she walked away, admiring her for her beauty and her high morals.            

There were many women who had been badly disfigured by the violent atmosphereof the time, but there was no one among them more terrifying than MadameDefarge, who was now walking through the streets. She had a strong and fearlesscharacter and was smart and always prepared. She was determined and had the kindof beauty that not only seems to impart strength and ferocity but also makesothers recognize those qualities in her instinctually. The troubled times wouldhave raised her up under any circumstances, but her childhood had also given hera sense of injustice and a hatred of the upper class. These conditions hadturned her into a tigress, and she was completely pitiless. If she had ever hadany pity in her, it was gone.             

She didnít care that an innocent man was about to die for the sins of hisancestors. She saw them, not him. She didnít care that his wife was about tobecome a widow and his daughter an orphan. That wasnít enough punishment,because they were her natural enemies and prey, and so they had no right tolive. It was useless to appeal to her, since she had no pity, even for herself.If she had been struck down in the streets in one of the many battles she hadbeen involved in, she wouldnít have pitied herself. If she were sent to theguillotine to die tomorrow, she wouldnít feel anything but a strong desire tosee the person who sent her there killed instead.             

That was the heart Madame Defarge had under her rough robe. She wore her robecarelessly. It was an attractive robe in a strange way. Her dark hair lookedthick under her rough red cap. A loaded pistol hid in her shirt, and a sharpdagger was hidden at her waist. Dressed like this, she walked confidently, likea woman who had often walked barefoot and barelegged along brown, sandy beachesas a young girl. Madame Defarge made her way through the streets.             

At that very moment the traveling coach was waiting for the rest of itspassengers. When the journey had been planned out the night before, Mr. Lorryhad worried about what to do with Miss Pross. It wasnít only that they didnítwant to overload the coach, but it was also very important that they kept thetime required for the guards to examine all the passengers as short as possible,since their escape might depend on saving a few seconds here or there. Afterthinking it over anxiously, he finally suggested that Miss Pross and Jerry, whowere free to leave the city at any time, should leave at three oíclock in thefastest possible vehicle. They were unburdened by luggage and would overtake thecoach soon. Then they would pass it and go ahead of it on the road. This wouldspeed up their progress during the night when they were most worried about beingdelayed.             

Miss Pross was very pleased with this plan, as it offered a way to help themduring their emergency. She and Jerry had seen the coach leave. They knew thather brother, Solomon, had helped Darnay into the coach disguised as Carton. Theyhad spent about ten minutes in torturous suspense and were now finishing theirarrangements to follow the coach as Madame Defarge made her way through thestreets. Madame Defarge got closer and closer to the otherwise deserted housewhere they were meeting.             

ìWhat do you think, Mr. Cruncher?î said Miss Pross. She was so nervous thatshe could hardly speak, or stand, or move, or live. ìWhat do you think aboutleaving from another courtyard? Another carriage has already left from heretoday. It might look suspicious.î            

ìI think youíre right, miss,î answered Mr. Cruncher. ìEither way, Iíll do whatyou want, right or wrong.î            

ìI am so troubled with fear and hope for our friends that I am unable to forma plan,î said Miss Pross, crying wildly. ìAre you able to form any plan, Mr.Cruncher?î            

ìI hope I will be able to in the future,î answered Mr. Cruncher. ìRight now,Iím not able to think of anything. Would you do me a favor, miss, and listen totwo promises and vows that I want to have on record here in this crisis?î            

ìOh, for gracious sake!î cried Miss Pross, still crying wildly. ìSay themquickly and get them out of the way, like a good man.î            

ìFirst,î said Mr. Cruncher, trembling and looking pale and serious. ìIf ourpoor friends get away, I wonít do it anymore! Never again!î            

ìIím quite sure that you will never do it again, Mr. Cruncher, whatever it is.Please donít think you need to tell me what youíre talking about.î            

ìNo, miss,î answered Jerry. ìI wonít tell you what it is. Second, if our poorfriends get away, I wonít ever interfere with Mrs. Cruncherís praying. Neveragain!î            

ìWhatever situation you have at home,î said Miss Pross, trying to dry her eyesand compose herself, ìI know itís best that Mrs. Cruncher is able to do what shewants. Oh, my poor friends!î            

ìRemember what Iím telling you and tell Mrs. Cruncher yourself,î continued Mr.Cruncher, speaking as though he were preaching at a church pulpit. ìIíd go sofar as to say that my opinions about praying have changed. I only hope with allmy heart that Mrs. Cruncher is praying right now.î            

ìThere, there! I hope she is, my dear man,î cried Miss Pross. ìAnd I hope thather prayers are answered.î            

ìGod forbid that anything I have ever said or done wrong would ever hurt ourpoor friends,î continued Mr. Cruncher, even more seriously and more slowly. ìIfitís possible, we should both pray to get our friends out of this riskysituation! God forbid, miss. Thatís what I say. Forbid it!î Mr.Cruncher tried to find a good ending to his speech, but this was the best hecould do.             

Meanwhile, Madame Defarge was still making her way through the streets andgetting closer and closer.             

ìIf we ever get back to England,î said Miss Pross, ìyou can rely on my tellingMrs. Cruncher as much as I can remember and understand of what you have soimpressively said. You can be sure that I will swear that you were completelyserious about it at the time. Now, please, letís think of a plan! My good Mr.Cruncher, letís think!î            

Madame Defarge was still making her way through the streets and getting closerand closer.             

ìWouldnít it be best if you went on ahead, stopped the horses and carriagefrom coming here, and then waited for me somewhere else?î asked MissPross.            

Mr. Cruncher thought that was best.             

ìWhere could you wait for me?î asked Miss Pross.            

Mr. Cruncher was so confused that the only place he could think of was TempleBar. Unfortunately Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away, and Madame Defarge wasgetting very close.             

ìThe door of Notre Dame cathedral,î said Miss Pross. ìWould it be too much outof your way to meet me near the big cathedral door between the twotowers?î            

ìNo, miss,î answered Mr. Cruncher.             

ìThen go to the posting house right away, like a good man, and change ourarrangements,î said Miss Pross.            

ìI am worried about leaving you. We donít know what could happen,î said Mr.Cruncher, hesitating and shaking his head.             

ìHeaven knows we donít,î answered Miss Pross. ìBut donít worry about me. Pickme up at the cathedral at three oíclock or as close to three as you can. Iímsure that that will be better than leaving from here. Iím certain of it. There!Bless you, Mr. Cruncher! Donít worry about me! Worry about the lives of thepeople who depend on us!î            

Miss Prossís grabbed his hands and begged him. This, along with her convincingargument, convinced Mr. Cruncher. He nodded encouragingly once or twice andimmediately went out to change their arrangements. He left her by herself tofollow later as she had suggested.             

Miss Pross was relieved to have come up with a precaution that was alreadybeing put into action. She needed to dress herself in a way that wouldnít drawattention in the streets. This activity was another relief to her. She looked ather watch. It was twenty minutes past two. She couldnít waste any time. She hadto get ready at once.             

She was distressed and afraid to be alone in the empty rooms. She keptthinking she saw faces peeking out from behind every open door. Miss Pross got abasin of cold water and splashed water on her eyes, which were swollen and redfrom crying. She was so bothered by her fears that she couldnít bear to have hersight obstructed by the dripping water for even a minute. She kept pausing andlooking around to make sure no one was watching her. In one of those pauses, shedrew back and screamed, for she saw someone standing in the room.            

The basin fell and broke on the ground, and the water flowed to the feet ofMadame Defarge. Many strange circumstances and much spilling of blood hadbrought her feet there.             

Madame Defarge looked at her coldly and said, ìWhere is Evremondeíswife?î            

It occurred to Miss Pross that all the doors were open and it would show thatthey had all fled the city. The first thing she did was close them, and then shemoved in front of the door of Lucieís room.             

Madame Defarge watched her with her dark eyes as she moved quickly around theroom and stared at her after she was finished. There was nothing beautiful aboutMiss Prossóage had not made her appearance less wild or less grimóbut Miss Prosswas a determined woman in her own way. She looked Madame Defarge up and down.        

ìYou look like you could be the devilís wife,î said Miss Pross, breathingheavily. ìEven so, you wonít get the better of me. I am an Englishwoman.î            

Madame Defarge looked at her with contempt, but she understood along with MissPross that they were challenging one another. Madame Defarge saw a tight, hard,wiry woman in front of her. She noticed the same things that Mr. Lorry hadnoticed about her many years ago. She knew very well that Miss Pross was adevoted friend to the Manette family, and Miss Pross knew very well that MadameDefarge was an enemy of the Manette family.             

ìIím on my way to the execution,î said Madame Defarge, gesturing slightly withher hand in the direction of the guillotine. ìThey save my seat for me and havemy knitting ready for me there. Iíve come to give my compliments to Lucie on myway. I want to see her.î            

ìI know that your intentions are evil,î said Miss Pross. ìYou can trust that Iwill hold my own in fighting against them.î            

Miss Pross spoke English and Madame Defarge spoke French, and neitherunderstood the other. Both were watching each other carefully and trying toguess from the otherís behavior what they were saying.             

ìIt wonít help Lucie to hide from me right now,î said Madame Defarge. ìGoodpatriots will know what it means if she does. Let me see her. Go tell her that Iwant to see her. Do you hear me?î            

ìIf your eyes were bed winchesa machine for lifting loads made of a rope or chain wound around a cylinderbed winches and I was an English four-poster bed, they wouldnít get asplinter out of me. No, you wicked, foreign woman. I am your match.î            

Madame Defarge didnít follow these remarks very closely, but she understoodthem enough to know that Miss Pross wasnít going to go get Lucie.             

ìYou stupid pig!î said Madame Defarge, frowning. ìYouíre not answering me. Idemand to see her. Either tell her that I demand to see her or get out of theway of the door and let me go see her myself!î She waved her right arm angrilyas she said this.             

ìI never thought that I would ever want to understand your ridiculouslanguage, but I would give all I have, besides the clothes Iím wearing now, toknow whether you suspect the truth, or any part of it.î            

Neither one of them would stop staring into the otherís eyes for a singlemoment. Madame Defarge hadnít moved from where she stood when Miss Pross firstrealized she was there, but now she moved forward one step.             

ìI am British,î said Miss Pross. ìI am desperate, and I donít care two penniesfor myself. I know that the longer I keep you here, the greater the hope is forLucie. I will tear all of your dark hair clean off your head if you lay a fingeron me!î            

As Miss Pross spoke, she shook her head, glaring at Madame Defarge and takinga breath between every quick sentence. Miss Pross had threatened her, though shehad never hit anyone in her life.             

Her courage made her so emotional that it brought tears into her eyes. MadameDefarge misunderstood this as weakness. ìHa, ha!î she laughed. ìYou pitiful,worthless woman. Iíll speak to Dr. Manette.î Then she raised her voice andcalled out, ìCitizen doctor! Wife of Evremonde! Child of Evremonde! Anyone herebut this miserable fool Iím talking to, answer me!î            

Maybe it was the silence that followed, or the expression on Miss Prossísface, or a sudden worry that had nothing to do with either, but something madeMadame Defarge think that they might all be gone. She opened three of the doorsquickly and looked into the other rooms.             

ìThose rooms are all a mess. Someone has been packing quickly, and there areodds and ends on the ground. There is no one in that room behind you, is there?Let me look.î            

ìNever!î said Miss Pross, who understood the request as perfectly as MadameDefarge understood the answer.             

ìIf they arenít in that room, then they are gone. They can be chased andbrought back,î Madame Defarge thought.             

ìAs long as you donít learn whether they are in that room or not, you wonítknow what to do,î Miss Pross thought. ìAnd you wonít learn that if I can helpit. Whether you know that or not, you will stay here as long as I can keep youhere.î            

ìI have been fighting in the streets since the beginning of the Revolution,and nothing has stopped me. I will tear you to pieces if I have to, but I willmove you away from that door,î said Madame Defarge.             

ìWe are alone at the top of a tall house in an empty courtyard. No one islikely to hear us. I pray for the physical strength to keep you here. Everyminute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to my darling Lucie,îsaid Miss Pross.             

Madame Defarge moved toward the door. Miss Pross instinctively grabbed heraround the waist with both arms and held onto her tightly. It was pointless forMadame Defarge to struggle and hit at her. Miss Pross held on to her tightlywith the strength of love, which is always much stronger than hate. She evenlifted her up off the floor while they struggled, and Madame Defarge beat andtore at Miss Prossís face with her hands. Miss Pross kept her head down and heldher around her waist, clinging to her with the force of a drowning woman.        

Soon, Madame Defarge stopped hitting Miss Pross and reached for the knifehidden at her waist. ìYour knife is under my arm,î said Miss Pross. Her voicewas stifled as they struggled. ìYou wonít draw it. Iím stronger than you, thankHeaven. Iíll hold you until one or the other of us faints or dies!î            

Madame Defargeís hands reached for her bosom. Miss Pross looked up and sawthat she had grabbed her pistol. She struck at it, and there was a flash and acrash. Miss Pross stood there alone, blinded by smoke.             

All of this happened in a second, and there was an awful stillness as thesmoke cleared. The smoke moved through the air like the soul of Madame Defarge,whose body lied lifeless on the ground.             

At first, Miss Pross was frightened and horrified, and she moved as far awayfrom the body as she could. She ran downstairs to call for help, even though itwas useless. Fortunately, she thought about the consequences of what she haddone in time to stop herself and go back upstairs. It was awful for her to go inthe room again, but she went back inside. She even went near the body to get thebonnet and other things that she needed to wear. She went out into the staircaseand got dressed, but first she locked the door and took the key. She sat down onthe stairs for a few moments to catch her breath and cry, and then she got upand hurried away.             

Luckily she had a veil on her bonnet. Otherwise she wouldnít have been able togo through the streets without being stopped. Luckily, too, she always looked sostrange that the dishevelment on her wasnít as obvious as it would have been onany other woman. She needed both of these advantages, for there were deep markson her face from Madame Defargeís gripping fingers. Her hair was torn, and herdress, which she had quickly adjusted with her trembling hands, had been pulledand tugged a hundred different ways.             

She dropped the key to the front door in the river as she crossed the bridgeand arrived at the cathedral a few minutes before Jerry. While she was waiting,she thought, ìWhat if the key had already been caught in a net and identified?What if they opened the door and discovered Madame Defargeís body? What if I amstopped at the gate, sent to prison, and charged with murder?î While she wasthinking these thoughts, Jerry appeared. He took her into the carriage and tookher away.             

ìIs there any noise in the streets?î she asked him.            

ìThe usual noises,î answered Mr. Cruncher. He was surprised by the questionand surprised by the way she looked.             

ìI didnít hear you,î said Miss Pross. ìWhat did you say?î            

It was pointless for Mr. Cruncher to repeat what he had said. Miss Prosscouldnít hear him. ìIíll nod my head,î thought Mr. Cruncher, amazed. ìSheíll seethat no matter what.î And she did.            

ìIs there any noise in the streets now?î asked Miss Pross again.             

Mr. Cruncher nodded his head again.            

ìI donít hear it.î            

ìHas she gone deaf in the last hour?î Mr. Cruncher asked himself, thinking itover, disturbed. ìWhatís happened to her?î            

ìI feel as if there was a flash and a crash, and that crash was the last thingIíll ever hear in my life,î said Miss Pross.             

ìSheís is a strange state,î said Mr. Cruncher, becoming more and moredisturbed. ìHas she been taking something to keep her courage up? Listen!Thereís the roll of those dreadful carts! You can hear that, canít you,miss?î            

ìI canít hear anything,î said Miss Pross, seeing that he was speaking to her.ìOh, my good man. First there was a loud crash and then silence. That silenceseems to be permanent and constant. It will never be broken as long as Ilive.î            

ìIf she canít hear the rolling of those dreadful carts, which are now veryclose to their journeyís end,î said Mr. Cruncher, looking over his shoulder, ìIthink that she will never hear anything else in this world.î            

And indeed she never did.             

The empty death carts rumble harshly along the streets of Paris. Six cartscarry the prisoners who are to be executed that day to the guillotine. Theguillotine is like all of the devouring, ravenous monsters that have ever beenimagined, combined into one. And yet even in France, with its rich soil and goodweather, there isnít a blade of grass, a leaf, a root, a sprig, or a singlepeppercorn that will grow to maturity more predictably than the Revolution did.If people are beaten down again like this, the same horrible thing will happen.If greed and oppression are allowed to grow again, it will produce a similarresult.             

Six carts roll along the streets. Time, you powerful magician! Change theseback to the innocent farm carts that they used to be and you would see that theywere the carriages of ruling monarchs and feudal nobles, the dressing rooms ofprostitutes, the churches that are not houses of God but dens of thieves, thehuts of millions of starving peasants. No, the great magician who does Godíswork never reverses what he has changed. ìIf you were changed into this shape byGod,î say the seers to the enchanted in the wise Arabian stories, ìthen you muststay that way! But if youíve been changed by mere magic, then return to yourformer shape!î The tumbrils will not change back to what they were. Theycontinue to roll along the streets.             

As the somber wheels of the six carts roll along, they clear a long, crookedpath through the crowds in the streets. People move to either side, and thetumbrils move forward steadily. The people living in the houses nearby are soused to the tumbrils coming through that many of them donít even look out theirwindows. Other people donít even pause in their work as they look at the peoplein the tumbrils. Some houses have visitors that have come to see the tumbrils goby. Their host points his finger at one cart after another like the curator of amuseum, and explains to them who was carted to the guillotine yesterday and twodays before.             

Some of the people riding in the tumbrils look at these things, and look ateverything else, with a blank stare. Others look on with a lingering interest inthe ways of life. Some are seated with their heads down and sunk into silentdespair. Some are so aware of their appearance that they look out at the crowdswith looks they have seen in plays or in paintings. Several close their eyes andtry to gather their thoughts together. Only one miserable creature looks crazed.He is so distraught and horrified that he sings and tries to dance. None of themtries to appeal by their looks or their gestures to the pity of the people inthe crowd.             

There is a group of horsemen riding alongside the tumbrils. People in thecrowd often look up at them and ask them questions. It always seems to be thesame question, for after the question is asked, people rush over to the thirdcart. The horsemen beside that cart often point out one man in it with theirswords. Everyone wants to know who he is. He is standing at the back of thetumbril with his head down, talking to a peasant girl who sits next to him inthe cart and holds his hand. He doesnít care about whatís happening around himand always talks to the girl. People all along St. Honore Street yell at him. Heonly smiles quietly, if he reacts at all, and shakes his hair a little moreloosely over his face. His arms are tied, so he canít touch his face.             

Barsad and the other prison spies wait for the tumbrils on the steps of thechurch. He looks into the first tumbril, but heís not there. He looks into thesecond one too, but heís not there. Heís already wondering, ìHas he betrayedme?î Then he looks into the third tumbril and feels relieved as he seeshim.            

ìWhich one is Evremonde?î asks a man behind him.             

ìThat one. At the back there.î            

ìHolding the girlís hand?î            

ìYes.î            

The man yells, ìDown with Evremonde! Send all aristocrats to the guillotine!Down with Evremonde!î            

ìHush, hush!î Barsad says to him timidly.            

ìAnd why not, citizen?î            

ìHeís going to pay for his crimes. He will be dead in five minutes. Leave himalone.î            

But the man continues to yell, ìDown with Evremonde!î Carton, pretending to beEvremonde, turns toward the man for a moment. Then Carton sees Barsad. He looksat him carefully, and goes his way.             

The clocks are striking three. The carts are pushing through the crowd theother way and arriving at the place where people are executed. The people whohave moved out of the way of the carts on either side now crowd in behind thelast cart as it moves on, for they are all following to the guillotine. In frontof it, a number of women sit in chairs as if they were in a public garden. Theyare busy knitting. The Vengeance is standing on one of the chairs in the frontlooking around for Madame Defarge.             

ìTherese!î she yells in her shrill voice. ìHas anyone seen her? ThereseDefarge!î            

ìSheís never missed an execution before,î says another of the knittingwomen.            

ìNo, and she wonít miss it now,î yells The Vengeance sullenly.            

ìYell louder,î suggests the other woman.            

Yes! Yell louder, Vengeance. Yell much louder and she wonít come. Yell evenlouder, Vengeance, and yell a little oath with it, and she still wonít come.Send other women all over to look for her. And yet, even though the people yousend have done terrible things, itís doubtful they will be willing to die tofind her!            

ìWhat bad luck!î yells The Vengeance, stomping her foot on the chair. ìAndhere are the tumbrils! And Evremonde will be killed in just a moment. And sheísnot here! See! Her knitting is in my hand and her empty chair is ready for her.Iím so angry and disappointed I will cry!î            

As The Vengeance gets down off of her chair to cry, the tumbrils begin tounload the prisoners. The executioners at the guillotine are dressed and ready.There is a crash. Someoneís head is cut off and held up to the crowd. Theknitting women, who hardly looked at the head a moment ago when it was alive,count ìone.î            

The second tumbril empties and moves on. The third comes up. There is a crash.The knitting women, who never stop knitting, count ìtwo.î            

The man who is supposedly Evremonde climbs down from the tumbril. Theseamstress is lifted out after him. He doesnít let go of her hand as he getsout, but is still holding it as he promised. He gently places her with her backto the guillotine. The blade is constantly whirring up to the top and thenfalling down again. She looks into his face and thanks him.             

ìIf not for you, dear stranger, I wouldnít be so calm. I am a poor littlething and am weak. Nor would I have been able to turn my thoughts to Him whodied so that we could have hope and comfort here today. I think you were sent tome by Heaven.î            

ìOr you to me,î says Sydney Carton. ìKeep looking at me, dear child, and donítworry about anything else.î            

ìI donít worry about anything while I hold your hand. I wonít worry aboutanything when I let it go either, if they kill me quickly.î            

ìThey will be quick. Donít be afraid!î            

The two of them stand in the quickly shrinking group of victims. But they arespeaking as if they are alone. Their looks, their voices, their hands, and theirhearts are connected. These two children of the earth, the Universal Mother, whoare otherwise so different, have come together on the way to their deaths, torest in her bosom.             

ìMy brave, generous friend. Will you let me ask you one last question? I donítunderstand something, and it bothers me a little.î            

ìWhat is it?î            

ìI have a cousin. She is my only relative. She is an orphan, like me, and Ilove her very much. She is five years younger than I am, and she lives in afarmhouse in the south country. We had to leave each other because we were sopoor. She doesnít know that I am about to die because I donít know how to writeand couldnít send her a letter. Even if I could, how would I tell her? Itísbetter that she doesnít know.î            

ìYes, yes. Itís better that she doesnít know.î            

ìWhat Iíve been thinking as we rolled along, and what Iím still thinking now,as I look into your kind, strong face that gives me so much support, is this: Ifthe Republic really does help the poor, and they become less hungry and sufferless, she may live a long time. She may even live to be an old woman.î            

ìWhat then, my gentle sister?î            

ìDo you think that it will seem like a long time to me while I wait for her inHeaven, where I am sure you and I will both go when we die?î As she speaks heruncomplaining eyes fill with tears, and her lips tremble.            

ìIt wonít seem long, my dear child. There is no time in Heaven, and notroubles there.î            

ìYou are so comforting to me! I am so ignorant. Should I kiss you now? Is ittime?î            

ìYes.î            

She kisses his lips, and he kisses hers. They bless each other. Her hand isníttrembling when he lets go of it, and the expression on her face is sweet,bright, and strong. She goes to the guillotine before him, and is gone. Theknitting women count ìtwenty-two.î            

ìI am the resurrection and the life, says the Lord,î Carton thought. ìHe thatbelieves in me, even though he is dead, will live. Whoever lives and believes inme will never die.î            

Carton hears the murmuring of many voices in the crowd. He sees many facesturned up toward him and looking at him. He sees people on the outside of thecrowd push in so that the whole crowd moves forward like a wave. Then there is aflash and it all goes away. Twenty-three.             

***            

It was said in Paris that night that Carton had the most peaceful look on hisface that anyone had ever seen on someone sent to the guillotine. Many peopleadded that he looked almost heavenly, and like a prophet.             

One of the most remarkable people who died that same day at the guillotine wasa woman who had asked at the foot of that same scaffold earlier if she couldwrite down what she was thinking. If Carton had said what he had been thinking,and if he had been able to see into the future, he would have said this:            

ìI see Barsad, Cly, Defarge, The Vengeance, Jacques Three the juryman, thejudge, the many new tyrants that have taken over after destroying the old, alldying at the guillotine, before it stops being used. I see the beautiful city ofParis and the wonderful people of France rising up from this abyss, In theirstruggles to be truly free, in their triumphs and defeats for many years tocome, I see the evil of this time, and the evil of the time before that causedthe Revolution, gradually making amends for itself and dying out.             

ìI see the people for which I died living peaceful, useful, successful, andhappy lives back in the England I will never see again. I see Lucie with a childon her breast who is named after me. I see Dr. Manette, who is old and bent overbut otherwise healthy again. He is treating patients and is at peace. I see Mr.Lorry, who has been their friend for so long, enriching their lives for tenyears, and dying tranquilly.             

ìI see that I hold a special place in their hearts and in the hearts of futuregenerations of their family. I see Lucie as an old woman, crying for me on theanniversary of the day I died. I see her and Charles dying and lying next toeach other in their graves. I know that they honored me in their souls as muchas they honored each other.             

ìI see that child who lay on Lucieís breast and who was named after mebecoming a man and succeeding as a lawyer. I see him being so successful that hebrings honor to my name by his actions. I see the damage I had done to my namethrough my bad behavior fade away. I see him, the best of just judges andhonored men, having a boy and naming it after me. The boy has a wrinkledforehead and blond hair like Lucieís. I see him bringing the boy here, which bythen is a beautiful place without a trace of the guillotine to be seen. I hearhim tell the child my story tenderly and emotionally.             

ìIt is a far, far better thing that I do than I have ever done. It is a far,far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.î
