They were both silent.
Yours is a long life to look back upon, sir? said Carton, wistfully.
I am in my seventy-eighth year.
You have been useful all your life; steadily and constantly occupied;trusted, respected, and looked up to?
I have been a man of business, ever since I have been a man. Indeed, I maysay that I was a man of business when a boy.
See what a place you fill at seventy-eight. How many people will miss youwhen you leave it empty!
A solitary old bachelor, answered Mr. Lorry, shaking his head. There isnobody to weep for me.
How can you say that? Wouldn't She weep for you? Wouldn't her child?
Yes, yes, thank God. I didn't quite mean what I said.
It IS a thing to thank God for; is it not?
Surely, surely.
If you could say, with truth, to your own solitary heart, to-night, I havesecured to myself the love and attachment, the gratitude or respect, of no humancreature; I have won myself a tender place in no regard; I have done nothinggood or serviceable to be remembered by!' your seventy-eight years would beseventy-eight heavy curses; would they not?
You say truly, Mr. Carton; I think they would be.
Sydney turned his eyes again upon the fire, and, after a silence of a fewmoments, said:
I should like to ask you: Does your childhood seem far off? Do the days whenyou sat at your mother's knee, seem days of very long ago?
Responding to his softened manner, Mr. Lorry answered:
Twenty years back, yes; at this time of my life, no. For, as I draw closerand closer to the end, I travel in the circle, nearer and nearer to thebeginning. It seems to be one of the kind smoothings and preparings of the way.My heart is touched now, by many remembrances that had long fallen asleep, of mypretty young mother (and I so old!), and by many associations of the days whenwhat we call the World was not so real with me, and my faults were not confirmedin me.
I understand the feeling! exclaimed Carton, with a bright flush. And youare the better for it?
I hope so.
Carton terminated the conversation here, by rising to help him on with hisouter coat; But you, said Mr. Lorry, reverting to the theme, you areyoung.
Yes, said Carton. I am not old, but my young way was never the way to age.Enough of me.
And of me, I am sure, said Mr. Lorry. Are you going out?
I'll walk with you to her gate. You know my vagabond and restless habits. IfI should prowl about the streets a long time, don't be uneasy; I shall reappearin the morning. You go to the Court to-morrow?
Yes, unhappily.
I shall be there, but only as one of the crowd. My Spy will find a place forme. Take my arm, sir.
Mr. Lorry did so, and they went down-stairs and out in the streets. A fewminutes brought them to Mr. Lorry's destination. Carton left him there; butlingered at a little distance, and turned back to the gate again when it wasshut, and touched it. He had heard of her going to the prison every day. Shecame out here, he said, looking about him, turned this way, must have trod onthese stones often. Let me follow in her steps.
It was ten o'clock at night when he stood before the prison of La Force, whereshe had stood hundreds of times. A little wood-sawyer, having closed his shop,was smoking his pipe at his shop-door.
Good night, citizen, said Sydney Carton, pausing in going by; for, the maneyed him inquisitively.
Good night, citizen.
How goes the Republic?
You mean the Guillotine. Not ill. Sixty-three to-day. We shall mount to ahundred soon. Samson and his men complain sometimes, of being exhausted. Ha, ha,ha! He is so droll, that Samson. Such a Barber!
Do you often go to see him
Shave? Always. Every day. What a barber! You have seen him at work?
Never.
Go and see him when he has a good batch. Figure this to yourself, citizen; heshaved the sixty-three to-day, in less than two pipes! Less than two pipes. Wordof honour!
As the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking, to explain how hetimed the executioner, Carton was so sensible of a rising desire to strike thelife out of him, that he turned away.
But you are not English, said the wood-sawyer, though you wear Englishdress?
Yes, said Carton, pausing again, and answering over his shoulder.
You speak like a Frenchman.
I am an old student here.
Aha, a perfect Frenchman! Good night, Englishman.
Good night, citizen.
But go and see that droll dog, the little man persisted, calling after him.And take a pipe with you!
Sydney had not gone far out of sight, when he stopped in the middle of thestreet under a glimmering lamp, and wrote with his pencil on a scrap of paper.Then, traversing with the decided step of one who remembered the way well,several dark and dirty streetsmuch dirtier than usual, for the best publicthoroughfares remained uncleansed in those times of terrorhe stopped at achemist's shop, which the owner was closing with his own hands. A small, dim,crooked shop, kept in a tortuous, up-hill thoroughfare, by a small, dim, crookedman.
Giving this citizen, too, good night, as he confronted him at his counter, helaid the scrap of paper before him. Whew! the chemist whistled softly, as heread it. Hi! hi! hi!
Sydney Carton took no heed, and the chemist said:
For you, citizen?
For me.
You will be careful to keep them separate, citizen? You know the consequencesof mixing them?
Perfectly.
Certain small packets were made and given to him. He put them, one by one, inthe breast of his inner coat, counted out the money for them, and deliberatelyleft the shop. There is nothing more to do, said he, glancing upward at themoon, until to-morrow. I can't sleep.
It was not a reckless manner, the manner in which he said these words aloudunder the fast-sailing clouds, nor was it more expressive of negligence thandefiance. It was the settled manner of a tired man, who had wandered andstruggled and got lost, but who at length struck into his road and saw itsend.
Long ago, when he had been famous among his earliest competitors as a youth ofgreat promise, he had followed his father to the grave. His mother had died,years before. These solemn words, which had been read at his father's grave,arose in his mind as he went down the dark streets, among the heavy shadows,with the moon and the clouds sailing on high above him. I am the resurrectionand the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yetshall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall neverdie.
In a city dominated by the axe, alone at night, with natural sorrow rising inhim for the sixty-three who had been that day put to death, and for to-morrow'svictims then awaiting their doom in the prisons, and still of to-morrow's andto-morrow's, the chain of association that brought the words home, like a rustyold ship's anchor from the deep, might have been easily found. He did not seekit, but repeated them and went on.
With a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were going torest, forgetful through a few calm hours of the horrors surrounding them; in thetowers of the churches, where no prayers were said, for the popular revulsionhad even travelled that length of self-destruction from years of priestlyimpostors, plunderers, and profligates; in the distant burial-places, reserved,as they wrote upon the gates, for Eternal Sleep; in the abounding gaols; and inthe streets along which the sixties rolled to a death which had become so commonand material, that no sorrowful story of a haunting Spirit ever arose among thepeople out of all the working of the Guillotine; with a solemn interest in thewhole life and death of the city settling down to its short nightly pause infury; Sydney Carton crossed the Seine again for the lighter streets.
Few coaches were abroad, for riders in coaches were liable to be suspected,and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps, and put on heavy shoes, andtrudged. But, the theatres were all well filled, and the people pouredcheerfully out as he passed, and went chatting home. At one of the theatredoors, there was a little girl with a mother, looking for a way across thestreet through the mud. He carried the child over, and before the timid arm wasloosed from his neck asked her for a kiss.
I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in me,though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth inme, shall never die.
Now, that the streets were quiet, and the night wore on, the words were in theechoes of his feet, and were in the air. Perfectly calm and steady, he sometimesrepeated them to himself as he walked; but, he heard them always.
The night wore out, and, as he stood upon the bridge listening to the water asit splashed the river-walls of the Island of Paris, where the picturesqueconfusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light of the moon, the daycame coldly, looking like a dead face out of the sky. Then, the night, with themoon and the stars, turned pale and died, and for a little while it seemed as ifCreation were delivered over to Death's dominion.
But, the glorious sun, rising, seemed to strike those words, that burden ofthe night, straight and warm to his heart in its long bright rays. And lookingalong them, with reverently shaded eyes, a bridge of light appeared to span theair between him and the sun, while the river sparkled under it.
The strong tide, so swift, so deep, and certain, was like a congenial friend,in the morning stillness. He walked by the stream, far from the houses, and inthe light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the bank. When he awoke and wasafoot again, he lingered there yet a little longer, watching an eddy that turnedand turned purposeless, until the stream absorbed it, and carried it on to thesea. Like me.
A trading-boat, with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf, then glidedinto his view, floated by him, and died away. As its silent track in the waterdisappeared, the prayer that had broken up out of his heart for a mercifulconsideration of all his poor blindnesses and errors, ended in the words, I amthe resurrection and the life.
Mr. Lorry was already out when he got back, and it was easy to surmise wherethe good old man was gone. Sydney Carton drank nothing but a little coffee, atesome bread, and, having washed and changed to refresh himself, went out to theplace of trial.
The court was all astir and a-buzz, when the black sheepwhom many fell awayfrom in dreadpressed him into an obscure corner among the crowd. Mr. Lorry wasthere, and Doctor Manette was there. She was there, sitting beside herfather.
When her husband was brought in, she turned a look upon him, so sustaining, soencouraging, so full of admiring love and pitying tenderness, yet so courageousfor his sake, that it called the healthy blood into his face, brightened hisglance, and animated his heart. If there had been any eyes to notice theinfluence of her look, on Sydney Carton, it would have been seen to be the sameinfluence exactly.
Before that unjust Tribunal, there was little or no order of procedure,ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing. There could have been nosuch Revolution, if all laws, forms, and ceremonies, had not first been somonstrously abused, that the suicidal vengeance of the Revolution was to scatterthem all to the winds.
Every eye was turned to the jury. The same determined patriots and goodrepublicans as yesterday and the day before, and to-morrow and the day after.Eager and prominent among them, one man with a craving face, and his fingersperpetually hovering about his lips, whose appearance gave great satisfaction tothe spectators. A life-thirsting, cannibal-ooking, bloody-minded juryman, theJacques Three of St. Antoine. The whole jury, as a jury of dogs empannelled totry the deer.
Every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor. Nofavourable leaning in that quarter to-day. A fell, uncompromising, murderousbusiness-meaning there. Every eye then sought some other eye in the crowd, andgleamed at it approvingly; and heads nodded at one another, before bendingforward with a strained attention.
Charles Evremonde, called Darnay. Released yesterday. Reaccused and retakenyesterday. Indictment delivered to him last night. Suspected and Denounced enemyof the Republic, Aristocrat, one of a family of tyrants, one of a raceproscribed, for that they had used their abolished privileges to the infamousoppression of the people. Charles Evremonde, called Darnay, in right of suchproscription, absolutely Dead in Law.
To this effect, in as few or fewer words, the Public Prosecutor.
The President asked, was the Accused openly denounced or secretly?
Openly, President.
By whom?
Three voices. Ernest Defarge, wine-vendor of St. Antoine.
Good.
Therese Defarge, his wife.
Good.
Alexandre Manette, physician.
A great uproar took place in the court, and in the midst of it, Doctor Manettewas seen, pale and trembling, standing where he had been seated.
President, I indignantly protest to you that this is a forgery and a fraud.You know the accused to be the husband of my daughter. My daughter, and thosedear to her, are far dearer to me than my life. Who and where is the falseconspirator who says that I denounce the husband of my child!
Citizen Manette, be tranquil. To fail in submission to the authority of theTribunal would be to put yourself out of Law. As to what is dearer to you thanlife, nothing can be so dear to a good citizen as the Republic.
Loud acclamations hailed this rebuke. The President rang his bell, and withwarmth resumed.
If the Republic should demand of you the sacrifice of your child herself, youwould have no duty but to sacrifice her. Listen to what is to follow. In themeanwhile, be silent!
Frantic acclamations were again raised. Doctor Manette sat down, with his eyeslooking around, and his lips trembling; his daughter drew closer to him. Thecraving man on the jury rubbed his hands together, and restored the usual handto his mouth.
Defarge was produced, when the court was quiet enough to admit of his beingheard, and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment, and of his havingbeen a mere boy in the Doctor's service, and of the release, and of the state ofthe prisoner when released and delivered to him. This short examinationfollowed, for the court was quick with its work.
You did good service at the taking of the Bastille, citizen?
I believe so.
Here, an excited woman screeched from the crowd: You were one of the bestpatriots there. Why not say so? You were a cannonier that day there, and youwere among the first to enter the accursed fortress when it fell. Patriots, Ispeak the truth!
It was The Vengeance who, amidst the warm commendations of the audience, thusassisted the proceedings. The President rang his bell; but, The Vengeance,warming with encouragement, shrieked, I defy that bell! wherein she waslikewise much commended.
Inform the Tribunal of what you did that day within the Bastille,citizen.
I knew, said Defarge, looking down at his wife, who stood at the bottom ofthe steps on which he was raised, looking steadily up at him; I knew that thisprisoner, of whom I speak, had been confined in a cell known as One Hundred andFive, North Tower. I knew it from himself. He knew himself by no other name thanOne Hundred and Five, North Tower, when he made shoes under my care. As I servemy gun that day, I resolve, when the place shall fall, to examine that cell. Itfalls. I mount to the cell, with a fellow-citizen who is one of the Jury,directed by a gaoler. I examine it, very closely. In a hole in the chimney,where a stone has been worked out and replaced, I find a written paper. This isthat written paper. I have made it my business to examine some specimens of thewriting of Doctor Manette. This is the writing of Doctor Manette. I confide thispaper, in the writing of Doctor Manette, to the hands of the President.
Let it be read.
In a dead silence and stillnessthe prisoner under trial looking lovingly athis wife, his wife only looking from him to look with solicitude at her father,Doctor Manette keeping his eyes fixed on the reader, Madame Defarge never takinghers from the prisoner, Defarge never taking his from his feasting wife, and allthe other eyes there intent upon the Doctor, who saw none of themthe paper wasread, as follows.
I, Alexandre Manette, unfortunate physician, native of Beauvais, andafterwards resident in Paris, write this melancholy paper in my doleful cell inthe Bastille, during the last month of the year, 1767. I write it at stolenintervals, under every difficulty. I design to secrete it in the wall of thechimney, where I have slowly and laboriously made a place of concealment for it.Some pitying hand may find it there, when I and my sorrows are dust.
These words are formed by the rusty iron point with which I write withdifficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney, mixed with blood,in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity. Hope has quite departedfrom my breast. I know from terrible warnings I have noted in myself that myreason will not long remain unimpaired, but I solemnly declare that I am at thistime in the possession of my right mindthat my memory is exact andcircumstantialand that I write the truth as I shall answer for these my lastrecorded words, whether they be ever read by men or not, at the EternalJudgment-seat.
One cloudy moonlight night, in the third week of December (I think thetwenty-second of the month) in the year 1757, I was walking on a retired part ofthe quay by the Seine for the refreshment of the frosty air, at an hour'sdistance from my place of residence in the Street of the School of Medicine,when a carriage came along behind me, driven very fast. As I stood aside to letthat carriage pass, apprehensive that it might otherwise run me down, a head wasput out at the window, and a voice called to the driver to stop.
The carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses, and thesame voice called to me by my name. I answered. The carriage was then so far inadvance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the door and alight before Icame up with it.
I observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks, and appeared to concealthemselves. As they stood side by side near the carriage door, I also observedthat they both looked of about my own age, or rather younger, and that they weregreatly alike, in stature, manner, voice, and (as far as I could see) facetoo.
You are Doctor Manette?' said one.
I am.
Doctor Manette, formerly of Beauvais,' said the other; the young physician,originally an expert surgeon, who within the last year or two has made a risingreputation in Paris?'
Gentlemen,' I returned, I am that Doctor Manette of whom you speak sograciously.'
We have been to your residence,' said the first, and not being so fortunateas to find you there, and being informed that you were probably walking in thisdirection, we followed, in the hope of overtaking you. Will you please to enterthe carriage?'
The manner of both was imperious, and they both moved, as these words werespoken, so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door. They werearmed. I was not.
Gentlemen,' said I, pardon me; but I usually inquire who does me the honourto seek my assistance, and what is the nature of the case to which I amsummoned.'
The reply to this was made by him who had spoken second. Doctor, yourclients are people of condition. As to the nature of the case, our confidence inyour skill assures us that you will ascertain it for yourself better than we candescribe it. Enough. Will you please to enter the carriage?'
I could do nothing but comply, and I entered it in silence. They both enteredafter methe last springing in, after putting up the steps. The carriage turnedabout, and drove on at its former speed.
I repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred. I have no doubt that itis, word for word, the same. I describe everything exactly as it took place,constraining my mind not to wander from the task. Where I make the broken marksthat follow here, I leave off for the time, and put my paper in itshiding-place.
 * * *
The carriage left the streets behind, passed the North Barrier, and emergedupon the country road. At two-thirds of a league from the BarrierI did notestimate the distance at that time, but afterwards when I traversed itit struckout of the main avenue, and presently stopped at a solitary house. We all threealighted, and walked, by a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglectedfountain had overflowed, to the door of the house. It was not openedimmediately, in answer to the ringing of the bell, and one of my two conductorsstruck the man who opened it, with his heavy riding glove, across theface.
There was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention, for Ihad seen common people struck more commonly than dogs. But, the other of thetwo, being angry likewise, struck the man in like manner with his arm; the lookand bearing of the brothers were then so exactly alike, that I then firstperceived them to be twin brothers.
From the time of our alighting at the outer gate (which we found locked, andwhich one of the brothers had opened to admit us, and had relocked), I had heardcries proceeding from an upper chamber. I was conducted to this chamberstraight, the cries growing louder as we ascended the stairs, and I found apatient in a high fever of the brain, lying on a bed.
The patient was a woman of great beauty, and young; assuredly not much pasttwenty. Her hair was torn and ragged, and her arms were bound to her sides withsashes and handkerchiefs. I noticed that these bonds were all portions of agentleman's dress. On one of them, which was a fringed scarf for a dress ofceremony, I saw the armorial bearings of a Noble, and the letter E.
I saw this, within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient; for,in her restless strivings she had turned over on her face on the edge of thebed, had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth, and was in danger ofsuffocation. My first act was to put out my hand to relieve her breathing; andin moving the scarf aside, the embroidery in the corner caught my sight.
I turned her gently over, placed my hands upon her breast to calm her andkeep her down, and looked into her face. Her eyes were dilated and wild, and sheconstantly uttered piercing shrieks, and repeated the words, My husband, myfather, and my brother!' and then counted up to twelve, and said, Hush!' For aninstant, and no more, she would pause to listen, and then the piercing shriekswould begin again, and she would repeat the cry, My husband, my father, and mybrother!' and would count up to twelve, and say, Hush!' There was no variationin the order, or the manner. There was no cessation, but the regular moment'spause, in the utterance of these sounds.
How long,' I asked, has this lasted?'
To distinguish the brothers, I will call them the elder and the younger; bythe elder, I mean him who exercised the most authority. It was the elder whoreplied, Since about this hour last night.'
She has a husband, a father, and a brother?'
A brother.'
I do not address her brother?'
He answered with great contempt, No.'
She has some recent association with the number twelve?'
The younger brother impatiently rejoined, With twelve o'clock?'
See, gentlemen,' said I, still keeping my hands upon her breast, howuseless I am, as you have brought me! If I had known what I was coming to see, Icould have come provided. As it is, time must be lost. There are no medicines tobe obtained in this lonely place.'
The elder brother looked to the younger, who said haughtily, There is a caseof medicines here;' and brought it from a closet, and put it on thetable.
 * * *
I opened some of the bottles, smelt them, and put the stoppers to my lips. IfI had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that were poisons inthemselves, I would not have administered any of those.
Do you doubt them?' asked the younger brother.
You see, monsieur, I am going to use them,' I replied, and said nomore.
I made the patient swallow, with great difficulty, and after many efforts,the dose that I desired to give. As I intended to repeat it after a while, andas it was necessary to watch its influence, I then sat down by the side of thebed. There was a timid and suppressed woman in attendance (wife of the mandown-stairs), who had retreated into a corner. The house was damp and decayed,indifferently furnishedevidently, recently occupied and temporarily used. Somethick old hangings had been nailed up before the windows, to deaden the sound ofthe shrieks. They continued to be uttered in their regular succession, with thecry, My husband, my father, and my brother!' the counting up to twelve, andHush!' The frenzy was so violent, that I had not unfastened the bandagesrestraining the arms; but, I had looked to them, to see that they were notpainful. The only spark of encouragement in the case, was, that my hand upon thesufferer's breast had this much soothing influence, that for minutes at a timeit tranquillised the figure. It had no effect upon the cries; no pendulum couldbe more regular.
For the reason that my hand had this effect (I assume), I had sat by the sideof the bed for half an hour, with the two brothers looking on, before the eldersaid:
There is another patient.'
I was startled, and asked, Is it a pressing case?'
You had better see,' he carelessly answered; and took up a light.
 * * *
The other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase, which was aspecies of loft over a stable. There was a low plastered ceiling to a part ofit; the rest was open, to the ridge of the tiled roof, and there were beamsacross. Hay and straw were stored in that portion of the place, fagots forfiring, and a heap of apples in sand. I had to pass through that part, to get atthe other. My memory is circumstantial and unshaken. I try it with thesedetails, and I see them all, in this my cell in the Bastille, near the close ofthe tenth year of my captivity, as I saw them all that night.
On some hay on the ground, with a cushion thrown under his head, lay ahandsome peasant boya boy of not more than seventeen at the most. He lay on hisback, with his teeth set, his right hand clenched on his breast, and his glaringeyes looking straight upward. I could not see where his wound was, as I kneeledon one knee over him; but, I could see that he was dying of a wound from a sharppoint.
I am a doctor, my poor fellow,' said I. Let me examine it.'
I do not want it examined,' he answered; let it be.'
It was under his hand, and I soothed him to let me move his hand away. Thewound was a sword-thrust, received from twenty to twenty-four hours before, butno skill could have saved him if it had been looked to without delay. He wasthen dying fast. As I turned my eyes to the elder brother, I saw him lookingdown at this handsome boy whose life was ebbing out, as if he were a woundedbird, or hare, or rabbit; not at all as if he were a fellow-creature.
How has this been done, monsieur?' said I.
A crazed young common dog! A serf! Forced my brother to draw upon him, andhas fallen by my brother's swordlike a gentleman.'
There was no touch of pity, sorrow, or kindred humanity, in this answer. Thespeaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to have that differentorder of creature dying there, and that it would have been better if he had diedin the usual obscure routine of his vermin kind. He was quite incapable of anycompassionate feeling about the boy, or about his fate.
The boy's eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken, and they now slowlymoved to me.
Doctor, they are very proud, these Nobles; but we common dogs are proud too,sometimes. They plunder us, outrage us, beat us, kill us; but we have a littlepride left, sometimes. Shehave you seen her, Doctor?'
The shrieks and the cries were audible there, though subdued by the distance.He referred to them, as if she were lying in our presence.
I said, I have seen her.'
She is my sister, Doctor. They have had their shameful rights, these Nobles,in the modesty and virtue of our sisters, many years, but we have had good girlsamong us. I know it, and have heard my father say so. She was a good girl. Shewas betrothed to a good young man, too: a tenant of his. We were all tenants ofhisthat man's who stands there. The other is his brother, the worst of a badrace.'
It was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily force tospeak; but, his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis.
We were so robbed by that man who stands there, as all we common dogs are bythose superior Beingstaxed by him without mercy, obliged to work for himwithout pay, obliged to grind our corn at his mill, obliged to feed scores ofhis tame birds on our wretched crops, and forbidden for our lives to keep asingle tame bird of our own, pillaged and plundered to that degree that when wechanced to have a bit of meat, we ate it in fear, with the door barred and theshutters closed, that his people should not see it and take it from usI say, wewere so robbed, and hunted, and were made so poor, that our father told us itwas a dreadful thing to bring a child into the world, and that what we shouldmost pray for, was, that our women might be barren and our miserable race dieout!'
I had never before seen the sense of being oppressed, bursting forth like afire. I had supposed that it must be latent in the people somewhere; but, I hadnever seen it break out, until I saw it in the dying boy.
Nevertheless, Doctor, my sister married. He was ailing at that time, poorfellow, and she married her lover, that she might tend and comfort him in ourcottageour dog-hut, as that man would call it. She had not been married manyweeks, when that man's brother saw her and admired her, and asked that man tolend her to himfor what are husbands among us! He was willing enough, but mysister was good and virtuous, and hated his brother with a hatred as strong asmine. What did the two then, to persuade her husband to use his influence withher, to make her willing?'
The boy's eyes, which had been fixed on mine, slowly turned to the looker-on,and I saw in the two faces that all he said was true. The two opposing kinds ofpride confronting one another, I can see, even in this Bastille; thegentleman's, all negligent indifference; the peasants, all trodden-downsentiment, and passionate revenge.
You know, Doctor, that it is among the Rights of these Nobles to harness uscommon dogs to carts, and drive us. They so harnessed him and drove him. Youknow that it is among their Rights to keep us in their grounds all night,quieting the frogs, in order that their noble sleep may not be disturbed. Theykept him out in the unwholesome mists at night, and ordered him back into hisharness in the day. But he was not persuaded. No! Taken out of harness one dayat noon, to feedif he could find foodhe sobbed twelve times, once for everystroke of the bell, and died on her bosom.'
Nothing human could have held life in the boy but his determination to tellall his wrong. He forced back the gathering shadows of death, as he forced hisclenched right hand to remain clenched, and to cover his wound.
Then, with that man's permission and even with his aid, his brother took heraway; in spite of what I know she must have told his brotherand what that is,will not be long unknown to you, Doctor, if it is nowhis brother took herawayfor his pleasure and diversion, for a little while. I saw her pass me onthe road. When I took the tidings home, our father's heart burst; he never spokeone of the words that filled it. I took my young sister (for I have another) toa place beyond the reach of this man, and where, at least, she will never be HISvassal. Then, I tracked the brother here, and last night climbed ina commondog, but sword in hand. Where is the loft window? It was somewherehere?'
The room was darkening to his sight; the world was narrowing around him. Iglanced about me, and saw that the hay and straw were trampled over the floor,as if there had been a struggle.
She heard me, and ran in. I told her not to come near us till he was dead.He came in and first tossed me some pieces of money; then struck at me with awhip. But I, though a common dog, so struck at him as to make him draw. Let himbreak into as many pieces as he will, the sword that he stained with my commonblood; he drew to defend himselfthrust at me with all his skill for hislife.'
My glance had fallen, but a few moments before, on the fragments of a brokensword, lying among the hay. That weapon was a gentleman's. In another place, layan old sword that seemed to have been a soldier's.
Now, lift me up, Doctor; lift me up. Where is he?'
He is not here,' I said, supporting the boy, and thinking that he referredto the brother.
He! Proud as these nobles are, he is afraid to see me. Where is the man whowas here? Turn my face to him.'
I did so, raising the boy's head against my knee. But, invested for themoment with extraordinary power, he raised himself completely: obliging me torise too, or I could not have still supported him.
Marquis,' said the boy, turned to him with his eyes opened wide, and hisright hand raised, in the days when all these things are to be answered for, Isummon you and yours, to the last of your bad race, to answer for them. I markthis cross of blood upon you, as a sign that I do it. In the days when all thesethings are to be answered for, I summon your brother, the worst of the bad race,to answer for them separately. I mark this cross of blood upon him, as a signthat I do it.'
Twice, he put his hand to the wound in his breast, and with his forefingerdrew a cross in the air. He stood for an instant with the finger yet raised, andas it dropped, he dropped with it, and I laid him down dead.
 * * *
When I returned to the bedside of the young woman, I found her raving inprecisely the same order of continuity. I knew that this might last for manyhours, and that it would probably end in the silence of the grave.
I repeated the medicines I had given her, and I sat at the side of the beduntil the night was far advanced. She never abated the piercing quality of hershrieks, never stumbled in the distinctness or the order of her words. They werealways My husband, my father, and my brother! One, two, three, four, five, six,seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. Hush!'
This lasted twenty-six hours from the time when I first saw her. I had comeand gone twice, and was again sitting by her, when she began to falter. I didwhat little could be done to assist that opportunity, and by-and-bye she sankinto a lethargy, and lay like the dead.
It was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last, after a long and fearfulstorm. I released her arms, and called the woman to assist me to compose herfigure and the dress she had torn. It was then that I knew her condition to bethat of one in whom the first expectations of being a mother have arisen; and itwas then that I lost the little hope I had had of her.
Is she dead?' asked the Marquis, whom I will still describe as the elderbrother, coming booted into the room from his horse.
Not dead,' said I; but like to die.'
What strength there is in these common bodies!' he said, looking down at herwith some curiosity.
There is prodigious strength,' I answered him, in sorrow anddespair.'
He first laughed at my words, and then frowned at them. He moved a chair withhis foot near to mine, ordered the woman away, and said in a subduedvoice,
Doctor, finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds, Irecommended that your aid should be invited. Your reputation is high, and, as ayoung man with your fortune to make, you are probably mindful of your interest.The things that you see here, are things to be seen, and not spoken of.'
I listened to the patient's breathing, and avoided answering.
Do you honour me with your attention, Doctor?'
Monsieur,' said I, in my profession, the communications of patients arealways received in confidence.' I was guarded in my answer, for I was troubledin my mind with what I had heard and seen.
Her breathing was so difficult to trace, that I carefully tried the pulse andthe heart. There was life, and no more. Looking round as I resumed my seat, Ifound both the brothers intent upon me.
 * * *
I write with so much difficulty, the cold is so severe, I am so fearful ofbeing detected and consigned to an underground cell and total darkness, that Imust abridge this narrative. There is no confusion or failure in my memory; itcan recall, and could detail, every word that was ever spoken between me andthose brothers.
She lingered for a week. Towards the last, I could understand some fewsyllables that she said to me, by placing my ear close to her lips. She asked mewhere she was, and I told her; who I was, and I told her. It was in vain that Iasked her for her family name. She faintly shook her head upon the pillow, andkept her secret, as the boy had done.
I had no opportunity of asking her any question, until I had told thebrothers she was sinking fast, and could not live another day. Until then,though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save the woman and myself,one or other of them had always jealously sat behind the curtain at the head ofthe bed when I was there. But when it came to that, they seemed careless whatcommunication I might hold with her; as ifthe thought passed through my mindIwere dying too.
I always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger brother's(as I call him) having crossed swords with a peasant, and that peasant a boy.The only consideration that appeared to affect the mind of either of them wasthe consideration that this was highly degrading to the family, and wasridiculous. As often as I caught the younger brother's eyes, their expressionreminded me that he disliked me deeply, for knowing what I knew from the boy. Hewas smoother and more polite to me than the elder; but I saw this. I also sawthat I was an incumbrance in the mind of the elder, too.
My patient died, two hours before midnightat a time, by my watch, answeringalmost to the minute when I had first seen her. I was alone with her, when herforlorn young head drooped gently on one side, and all her earthly wrongs andsorrows ended.
The brothers were waiting in a room down-stairs, impatient to ride away. Ihad heard them, alone at the bedside, striking their boots with theirriding-whips, and loitering up and down.
At last she is dead?' said the elder, when I went in.
She is dead,' said I.
I congratulate you, my brother,' were his words as he turned round.
He had before offered me money, which I had postponed taking. He now gave mea rouleau of gold. I took it from his hand, but laid it on the table. I hadconsidered the question, and had resolved to accept nothing.
Pray excuse me,' said I. Under the circumstances, no.'
They exchanged looks, but bent their heads to me as I bent mine to them, andwe parted without another word on either side.
 * * *
I am weary, weary, wearyworn down by misery. I cannot read what I havewritten with this gaunt hand.
Early in the morning, the rouleau of gold was left at my door in a littlebox, with my name on the outside. From the first, I had anxiously consideredwhat I ought to do. I decided, that day, to write privately to the Minister,stating the nature of the two cases to which I had been summoned, and the placeto which I had gone: in effect, stating all the circumstances. I knew what Courtinfluence was, and what the immunities of the Nobles were, and I expected thatthe matter would never be heard of; but, I wished to relieve my own mind. I hadkept the matter a profound secret, even from my wife; and this, too, I resolvedto state in my letter. I had no apprehension whatever of my real danger; but Iwas conscious that there might be danger for others, if others were compromisedby possessing the knowledge that I possessed.
I was much engaged that day, and could not complete my letter that night. Irose long before my usual time next morning to finish it. It was the last day ofthe year. The letter was lying before me just completed, when I was told that alady waited, who wished to see me.
 * * *
I am growing more and more unequal to the task I have set myself. It is socold, so dark, my senses are so benumbed, and the gloom upon me is sodreadful.
The lady was young, engaging, and handsome, but not marked for long life. Shewas in great agitation. She presented herself to me as the wife of the MarquisSt. Evremonde. I connected the title by which the boy had addressed the elderbrother, with the initial letter embroidered on the scarf, and had no difficultyin arriving at the conclusion that I had seen that nobleman very lately.
My memory is still accurate, but I cannot write the words of ourconversation. I suspect that I am watched more closely than I was, and I knownot at what times I may be watched. She had in part suspected, and in partdiscovered, the main facts of the cruel story, of her husband's share in it, andmy being resorted to. She did not know that the girl was dead. Her hope hadbeen, she said in great distress, to show her, in secret, a woman's sympathy.Her hope had been to avert the wrath of Heaven from a House that had long beenhateful to the suffering many.
She had reasons for believing that there was a young sister living, and hergreatest desire was, to help that sister. I could tell her nothing but thatthere was such a sister; beyond that, I knew nothing. Her inducement to come tome, relying on my confidence, had been the hope that I could tell her the nameand place of abode. Whereas, to this wretched hour I am ignorant of both.
 * * *
These scraps of paper fail me. One was taken from me, with a warning,yesterday. I must finish my record to-day.
She was a good, compassionate lady, and not happy in her marriage. How couldshe be! The brother distrusted and disliked her, and his influence was allopposed to her; she stood in dread of him, and in dread of her husband too. WhenI handed her down to the door, there was a child, a pretty boy from two to threeyears old, in her carriage.
For his sake, Doctor,' she said, pointing to him in tears, I would do all Ican to make what poor amends I can. He will never prosper in his inheritanceotherwise. I have a presentiment that if no other innocent atonement is made forthis, it will one day be required of him. What I have left to call my ownit islittle beyond the worth of a few jewelsI will make it the first charge of hislife to bestow, with the compassion and lamenting of his dead mother, on thisinjured family, if the sister can be discovered.'
She kissed the boy, and said, caressing him, It is for thine own dear sake.Thou wilt be faithful, little Charles?' The child answered her bravely, Yes!' Ikissed her hand, and she took him in her arms, and went away caressing him. Inever saw her more.
As she had mentioned her husband's name in the faith that I knew it, I addedno mention of it to my letter. I sealed my letter, and, not trusting it out ofmy own hands, delivered it myself that day.
That night, the last night of the year, towards nine o'clock, a man in ablack dress rang at my gate, demanded to see me, and softly followed my servant,Ernest Defarge, a youth, up-stairs. When my servant came into the room where Isat with my wifeO my wife, beloved of my heart! My fair young English wife! wesaw the man, who was supposed to be at the gate, standing silent behindhim.
An urgent case in the Rue St. Honore, he said. It would not detain me, he hada coach in waiting.
It brought me here, it brought me to my grave. When I was clear of the house,a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from behind, and my arms werepinioned. The two brothers crossed the road from a dark corner, and identifiedme with a single gesture. The Marquis took from his pocket the letter I hadwritten, showed it me, burnt it in the light of a lantern that was held, andextinguished the ashes with his foot. Not a word was spoken. I was brought here,I was brought to my living grave.
If it had pleased GOD to put it in the hard heart of either of the brothers,in all these frightful years, to grant me any tidings of my dearest wifeso muchas to let me know by a word whether alive or deadI might have thought that Hehad not quite abandoned them. But, now I believe that the mark of the red crossis fatal to them, and that they have no part in His mercies. And them and theirdescendants, to the last of their race, I, Alexandre Manette, unhappy prisoner,do this last night of the year 1767, in my unbearable agony, denounce to thetimes when all these things shall be answered for. I denounce them to Heaven andto earth.
A terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done. A sound ofcraving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but blood. The narrativecalled up the most revengeful passions of the time, and there was not a head inthe nation but must have dropped before it.
Little need, in presence of that tribunal and that auditory, to show how theDefarges had not made the paper public, with the other captured Bastillememorials borne in procession, and had kept it, biding their time. Little needto show that this detested family name had long been anathematised by SaintAntoine, and was wrought into the fatal register. The man never trod groundwhose virtues and services would have sustained him in that place that day,against such denunciation.
And all the worse for the doomed man, that the denouncer was a well-knowncitizen, his own attached friend, the father of his wife. One of the frenziedaspirations of the populace was, for imitations of the questionable publicvirtues of antiquity, and for sacrifices and self-immolations on the people'saltar. Therefore when the President said (else had his own head quivered on hisshoulders), that the good physician of the Republic would deserve better stillof the Republic by rooting out an obnoxious family of Aristocrats, and woulddoubtless feel a sacred glow and joy in making his daughter a widow and herchild an orphan, there was wild excitement, patriotic fervour, not a touch ofhuman sympathy.
Much influence around him, has that Doctor? murmured Madame Defarge, smilingto The Vengeance. Save him now, my Doctor, save him!
At every juryman's vote, there was a roar. Another and another. Roar androar.
Unanimously voted. At heart and by descent an Aristocrat, an enemy of theRepublic, a notorious oppressor of the People. Back to the Conciergerie, andDeath within four-and-twenty hours!
The wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die, fell under thesentence, as if she had been mortally stricken. But, she uttered no sound; andso strong was the voice within her, representing that it was she of all theworld who must uphold him in his misery and not augment it, that it quicklyraised her, even from that shock.
The Judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of doors, theTribunal adjourned. The quick noise and movement of the court's emptying itselfby many passages had not ceased, when Lucie stood stretching out her armstowards her husband, with nothing in her face but love and consolation.
If I might touch him! If I might embrace him once! O, good citizens, if youwould have so much compassion for us!
There was but a gaoler left, along with two of the four men who had taken himlast night, and Barsad. The people had all poured out to the show in thestreets. Barsad proposed to the rest, Let her embrace him then; it is but amoment. It was silently acquiesced in, and they passed her over the seats inthe hall to a raised place, where he, by leaning over the dock, could fold herin his arms.
Farewell, dear darling of my soul. My parting blessing on my love. We shallmeet again, where the weary are at rest!
They were her husband's words, as he held her to his bosom.
I can bear it, dear Charles. I am supported from above: don't suffer for me.A parting blessing for our child.
I send it to her by you. I kiss her by you. I say farewell to her byyou.
My husband. No! A moment! He was tearing himself apart from her. We shallnot be separated long. I feel that this will break my heart by-and-bye; but Iwill do my duty while I can, and when I leave her, God will raise up friends forher, as He did for me.
Her father had followed her, and would have fallen on his knees to both ofthem, but that Darnay put out a hand and seized him, crying:
No, no! What have you done, what have you done, that you should kneel to us!We know now, what a struggle you made of old. We know, now what you underwentwhen you suspected my descent, and when you knew it. We know now, the naturalantipathy you strove against, and conquered, for her dear sake. We thank youwith all our hearts, and all our love and duty. Heaven be with you!
Her father's only answer was to draw his hands through his white hair, andwring them with a shriek of anguish.
It could not be otherwise, said the prisoner. All things have workedtogether as they have fallen out. It was the always-vain endeavour to dischargemy poor mother's trust that first brought my fatal presence near you. Good couldnever come of such evil, a happier end was not in nature to so unhappy abeginning. Be comforted, and forgive me. Heaven bless you!
As he was drawn away, his wife released him, and stood looking after him withher hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer, and with a radiantlook upon her face, in which there was even a comforting smile. As he went outat the prisoners' door, she turned, laid her head lovingly on her father'sbreast, tried to speak to him, and fell at his feet.
Then, issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never moved, SydneyCarton came and took her up. Only her father and Mr. Lorry were with her. Hisarm trembled as it raised her, and supported her head. Yet, there was an airabout him that was not all of pitythat had a flush of pride in it.
Shall I take her to a coach? I shall never feel her weight.
He carried her lightly to the door, and laid her tenderly down in a coach. Herfather and their old friend got into it, and he took his seat beside thedriver.
When they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark not manyhours before, to picture to himself on which of the rough stones of the streether feet had trodden, he lifted her again, and carried her up the staircase totheir rooms. There, he laid her down on a couch, where her child and Miss Prosswept over her.
Don't recall her to herself, he said, softly, to the latter, she is betterso. Don't revive her to consciousness, while she only faints.
Oh, Carton, Carton, dear Carton! cried little Lucie, springing up andthrowing her arms passionately round him, in a burst of grief. Now that youhave come, I think you will do something to help mamma, something to save papa!O, look at her, dear Carton! Can you, of all the people who love her, bear tosee her so?
He bent over the child, and laid her blooming cheek against his face. He puther gently from him, and looked at her unconscious mother.
Before I go, he said, and pausedI may kiss her?
It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face withhis lips, he murmured some words. The child, who was nearest to him, told themafterwards, and told her grandchildren when she was a handsome old lady, thatshe heard him say, A life you love.
When he had gone out into the next room, he turned suddenly on Mr. Lorry andher father, who were following, and said to the latter:
You had great influence but yesterday, Doctor Manette; let it at least betried. These judges, and all the men in power, are very friendly to you, andvery recognisant of your services; are they not?
Nothing connected with Charles was concealed from me. I had the strongestassurances that I should save him; and I did. He returned the answer in greattrouble, and very slowly.
Try them again. The hours between this and to-morrow afternoon are few andshort, but try.
I intend to try. I will not rest a moment.
That's well. I have known such energy as yours do great things beforenowthough never, he added, with a smile and a sigh together, such greatthings as this. But try! Of little worth as life is when we misuse it, it isworth that effort. It would cost nothing to lay down if it were not.
I will go, said Doctor Manette, to the Prosecutor and the Presidentstraight, and I will go to others whom it is better not to name. I will writetoo, andBut stay! There is a Celebration in the streets, and no one will beaccessible until dark.
That's true. Well! It is a forlorn hope at the best, and not much theforlorner for being delayed till dark. I should like to know how you speed;though, mind! I expect nothing! When are you likely to have seen these dreadpowers, Doctor Manette?
Immediately after dark, I should hope. Within an hour or two fromthis.
It will be dark soon after four. Let us stretch the hour or two. If I go toMr. Lorry's at nine, shall I hear what you have done, either from our friend orfrom yourself?
Yes.
May you prosper!
Mr. Lorry followed Sydney to the outer door, and, touching him on the shoulderas he was going away, caused him to turn.
I have no hope, said Mr. Lorry, in a low and sorrowful whisper.
Nor have I.
If any one of these men, or all of these men, were disposed to sparehimwhich is a large supposition; for what is his life, or any man's to them!Idoubt if they durst spare him after the demonstration in the court.
And so do I. I heard the fall of the axe in that sound.
Mr. Lorry leaned his arm upon the door-post, and bowed his face uponit.
Don't despond, said Carton, very gently; don't grieve. I encouraged DoctorManette in this idea, because I felt that it might one day be consolatory toher. Otherwise, she might think his life was want only thrown away or wasted,'and that might trouble her.
Yes, yes, yes, returned Mr. Lorry, drying his eyes, you are right. But hewill perish; there is no real hope.
Yes. He will perish: there is no real hope, echoed Carton.
And walked with a settled step, down-stairs.
Sydney Carton paused in the street, not quite decided where to go. AtTellson's banking-house at nine, he said, with a musing face. Shall I do well,in the mean time, to show myself? I think so. It is best that these peopleshould know there is such a man as I here; it is a sound precaution, and may bea necessary preparation. But care, care, care! Let me think it out!
Checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object, he took a turnor two in the already darkening street, and traced the thought in his mind toits possible consequences. His first impression was confirmed. It is best, hesaid, finally resolved, that these people should know there is such a man as Ihere. And he turned his face towards Saint Antoine.
Defarge had described himself, that day, as the keeper of a wine-shop in theSaint Antoine suburb. It was not difficult for one who knew the city well, tofind his house without asking any question. Having ascertained its situation,Carton came out of those closer streets again, and dined at a place ofrefreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner. For the first time in manyyears, he had no strong drink. Since last night he had taken nothing but alittle light thin wine, and last night he had dropped the brandy slowly down onMr. Lorry's hearth like a man who had done with it.
It was as late as seven o'clock when he awoke refreshed, and went out into thestreets again. As he passed along towards Saint Antoine, he stopped at ashop-window where there was a mirror, and slightly altered the disorderedarrangement of his loose cravat, and his coat-collar, and his wild hair. Thisdone, he went on direct to Defarge's, and went in.
There happened to be no customer in the shop but Jacques Three, of therestless fingers and the croaking voice. This man, whom he had seen upon theJury, stood drinking at the little counter, in conversation with the Defarges,man and wife. The Vengeance assisted in the conversation, like a regular memberof the establishment.
As Carton walked in, took his seat and asked (in very indifferent French) fora small measure of wine, Madame Defarge cast a careless glance at him, and thena keener, and then a keener, and then advanced to him herself, and asked himwhat it was he had ordered.
He repeated what he had already said.
English? asked Madame Defarge, inquisitively raising her darkeyebrows.
After looking at her, as if the sound of even a single French word were slowto express itself to him, he answered, in his former strong foreign accent.Yes, madame, yes. I am English!
Madame Defarge returned to her counter to get the wine, and, as he took up aJacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its meaning, he heardher say, I swear to you, like Evremonde!
Defarge brought him the wine, and gave him Good Evening.
How?
Good evening.
Oh! Good evening, citizen, filling his glass. Ah! and good wine. I drink tothe Republic.
Defarge went back to the counter, and said, Certainly, a little like. Madamesternly retorted, I tell you a good deal like. Jacques Three pacificallyremarked, He is so much in your mind, see you, madame. The amiable Vengeanceadded, with a laugh, Yes, my faith! And you are looking forward with so muchpleasure to seeing him once more to-morrow!
Carton followed the lines and words of his paper, with a slow forefinger, andwith a studious and absorbed face. They were all leaning their arms on thecounter close together, speaking low. After a silence of a few moments, duringwhich they all looked towards him without disturbing his outward attention fromthe Jacobin editor, they resumed their conversation.
It is true what madame says, observed Jacques Three. Why stop? There isgreat force in that. Why stop?
Well, well, reasoned Defarge, but one must stop somewhere. After all, thequestion is still where?
At extermination, said madame.
Magnificent! croaked Jacques Three. The Vengeance, also, highlyapproved.
Extermination is good doctrine, my wife, said Defarge, rather troubled; ingeneral, I say nothing against it. But this Doctor has suffered much; you haveseen him to-day; you have observed his face when the paper was read.
I have observed his face! repeated madame, contemptuously and angrily. Yes.I have observed his face. I have observed his face to be not the face of a truefriend of the Republic. Let him take care of his face!
And you have observed, my wife, said Defarge, in a deprecatory manner, theanguish of his daughter, which must be a dreadful anguish to him!
I have observed his daughter, repeated madame; yes, I have observed hisdaughter, more times than one. I have observed her to-day, and I have observedher other days. I have observed her in the court, and I have observed her in thestreet by the prison. Let me but lift my finger! She seemed to raise it (thelistener's eyes were always on his paper), and to let it fall with a rattle onthe ledge before her, as if the axe had dropped.
The citizeness is superb! croaked the Juryman.
She is an Angel! said The Vengeance, and embraced her.
As to thee, pursued madame, implacably, addressing her husband, if itdepended on theewhich, happily, it does notthou wouldst rescue this man evennow.
No! protested Defarge. Not if to lift this glass would do it! But I wouldleave the matter there. I say, stop there.
See you then, Jacques, said Madame Defarge, wrathfully; and see you, too,my little Vengeance; see you both! Listen! For other crimes as tyrants andoppressors, I have this race a long time on my register, doomed to destructionand extermination. Ask my husband, is that so.
It is so, assented Defarge, without being asked.
In the beginning of the great days, when the Bastille falls, he finds thispaper of to-day, and he brings it home, and in the middle of the night when thisplace is clear and shut, we read it, here on this spot, by the light of thislamp. Ask him, is that so.
It is so, assented Defarge.
That night, I tell him, when the paper is read through, and the lamp is burntout, and the day is gleaming in above those shutters and between those ironbars, that I have now a secret to communicate. Ask him, is that so.
It is so, assented Defarge again.
I communicate to him that secret. I smite this bosom with these two hands asI smite it now, and I tell him, Defarge, I was brought up among the fishermenof the sea-shore, and that peasant family so injured by the two Evremondebrothers, as that Bastille paper describes, is my family. Defarge, that sisterof the mortally wounded boy upon the ground was my sister, that husband was mysister's husband, that unborn child was their child, that brother was mybrother, that father was my father, those dead are my dead, and that summons toanswer for those things descends to me!' Ask him, is that so.
It is so, assented Defarge once more.
Then tell Wind and Fire where to stop, returned madame; but don't tellme.
Both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature of herwraththe listener could feel how white she was, without seeing herand bothhighly commended it. Defarge, a weak minority, interposed a few words for thememory of the compassionate wife of the Marquis; but only elicited from his ownwife a repetition of her last reply. Tell the Wind and the Fire where to stop;not me!
Customers entered, and the group was broken up. The English customer paid forwhat he had had, perplexedly counted his change, and asked, as a stranger, to bedirected towards the National Palace. Madame Defarge took him to the door, andput her arm on his, in pointing out the road. The English customer was notwithout his reflections then, that it might be a good deed to seize that arm,lift it, and strike under it sharp and deep.
But, he went his way, and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the prisonwall. At the appointed hour, he emerged from it to present himself in Mr.Lorry's room again, where he found the old gentleman walking to and fro inrestless anxiety. He said he had been with Lucie until just now, and had onlyleft her for a few minutes, to come and keep his appointment. Her father had notbeen seen, since he quitted the banking-house towards four o'clock. She had somefaint hopes that his mediation might save Charles, but they were very slight. Hehad been more than five hours gone: where could he be?
Mr. Lorry waited until ten; but, Doctor Manette not returning, and he beingunwilling to leave Lucie any longer, it was arranged that he should go back toher, and come to the banking-house again at midnight. In the meanwhile, Cartonwould wait alone by the fire for the Doctor.
He waited and waited, and the clock struck twelve; but Doctor Manette did notcome back. Mr. Lorry returned, and found no tidings of him, and brought none.Where could he be?
They were discussing this question, and were almost building up some weakstructure of hope on his prolonged absence, when they heard him on the stairs.The instant he entered the room, it was plain that all was lost.
Whether he had really been to any one, or whether he had been all that timetraversing the streets, was never known. As he stood staring at them, they askedhim no question, for his face told them everything.
I cannot find it, said he, and I must have it. Where is it?
His head and throat were bare, and, as he spoke with a helpless look strayingall around, he took his coat off, and let it drop on the floor.
Where is my bench? I have been looking everywhere for my bench, and I can'tfind it. What have they done with my work? Time presses: I must finish thoseshoes.
They looked at one another, and their hearts died within them.
Come, come! said he, in a whimpering miserable way; let me get to work.Give me my work.
Receiving no answer, he tore his hair, and beat his feet upon the ground, likea distracted child.
Don't torture a poor forlorn wretch, he implored them, with a dreadful cry;but give me my work! What is to become of us, if those shoes are not doneto-night?
Lost, utterly lost!
It was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him, or try to restore him,thatas if by agreementthey each put a hand upon his shoulder, and soothed himto sit down before the fire, with a promise that he should have his workpresently. He sank into the chair, and brooded over the embers, and shed tears.As if all that had happened since the garret time were a momentary fancy, or adream, Mr. Lorry saw him shrink into the exact figure that Defarge had had inkeeping.
Affected, and impressed with terror as they both were, by this spectacle ofruin, it was not a time to yield to such emotions. His lonely daughter, bereftof her final hope and reliance, appealed to them both too strongly. Again, as ifby agreement, they looked at one another with one meaning in their faces. Cartonwas the first to speak:
The last chance is gone: it was not much. Yes; he had better be taken to her.But, before you go, will you, for a moment, steadily attend to me? Don't ask mewhy I make the stipulations I am going to make, and exact the promise I am goingto exact; I have a reasona good one.
I do not doubt it, answered Mr. Lorry. Say on.
The figure in the chair between them, was all the time monotonously rockingitself to and fro, and moaning. They spoke in such a tone as they would haveused if they had been watching by a sick-bed in the night.
Carton stooped to pick up the coat, which lay almost entangling his feet. Ashe did so, a small case in which the Doctor was accustomed to carry the lists ofhis day's duties, fell lightly on the floor. Carton took it up, and there was afolded paper in it. We should look at this! he said. Mr. Lorry nodded hisconsent. He opened it, and exclaimed, Thank GOD!
What is it? asked Mr. Lorry, eagerly.
A moment! Let me speak of it in its place. First, he put his hand in hiscoat, and took another paper from it, that is the certificate which enables meto pass out of this city. Look at it. You seeSydney Carton, anEnglishman?
Mr. Lorry held it open in his hand, gazing in his earnest face.
Keep it for me until to-morrow. I shall see him to-morrow, you remember, andI had better not take it into the prison.
Why not?
I don't know; I prefer not to do so. Now, take this paper that Doctor Manettehas carried about him. It is a similar certificate, enabling him and hisdaughter and her child, at any time, to pass the barrier and the frontier! Yousee?
Yes!
Perhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against evil,yesterday. When is it dated? But no matter; don't stay to look; put it upcarefully with mine and your own. Now, observe! I never doubted until withinthis hour or two, that he had, or could have such a paper. It is good, untilrecalled. But it may be soon recalled, and, I have reason to think, willbe.
They are not in danger?
They are in great danger. They are in danger of denunciation by MadameDefarge. I know it from her own lips. I have overheard words of that woman's,to-night, which have presented their danger to me in strong colours. I have lostno time, and since then, I have seen the spy. He confirms me. He knows that awood-sawyer, living by the prison wall, is under the control of the Defarges,and has been rehearsed by Madame Defarge as to his having seen Herhe nevermentioned Lucie's namemaking signs and signals to prisoners. It is easy toforesee that the pretence will be the common one, a prison plot, and that itwill involve her lifeand perhaps her child'sand perhaps her father'sfor bothhave been seen with her at that place. Don't look so horrified. You will savethem all.
Heaven grant I may, Carton! But how?
I am going to tell you how. It will depend on you, and it could depend on nobetter man. This new denunciation will certainly not take place until afterto-morrow; probably not until two or three days afterwards; more probably a weekafterwards. You know it is a capital crime, to mourn for, or sympathise with, avictim of the Guillotine. She and her father would unquestionably be guilty ofthis crime, and this woman (the inveteracy of whose pursuit cannot be described)would wait to add that strength to her case, and make herself doubly sure. Youfollow me?
So attentively, and with so much confidence in what you say, that for themoment I lose sight, touching the back of the Doctor's chair, even of thisdistress.
You have money, and can buy the means of travelling to the seacoast asquickly as the journey can be made. Your preparations have been completed forsome days, to return to England. Early to-morrow have your horses ready, so thatthey may be in starting trim at two o'clock in the afternoon.
It shall be done!
His manner was so fervent and inspiring, that Mr. Lorry caught the flame, andwas as quick as youth.
You are a noble heart. Did I say we could depend upon no better man? Tellher, to-night, what you know of her danger as involving her child and herfather. Dwell upon that, for she would lay her own fair head beside herhusband's cheerfully. He faltered for an instant; then went on as before. Forthe sake of her child and her father, press upon her the necessity of leavingParis, with them and you, at that hour. Tell her that it was her husband's lastarrangement. Tell her that more depends upon it than she dare believe, or hope.You think that her father, even in this sad state, will submit himself to her;do you not?
I am sure of it.
I thought so. Quietly and steadily have all these arrangements made in thecourtyard here, even to the taking of your own seat in the carriage. The momentI come to you, take me in, and drive away.
I understand that I wait for you under all circumstances?
You have my certificate in your hand with the rest, you know, and willreserve my place. Wait for nothing but to have my place occupied, and then forEngland!
Why, then, said Mr. Lorry, grasping his eager but so firm and steady hand,it does not all depend on one old man, but I shall have a young and ardent manat my side.
By the help of Heaven you shall! Promise me solemnly that nothing willinfluence you to alter the course on which we now stand pledged to oneanother.
Nothing, Carton.
Remember these words to-morrow: change the course, or delay in itfor anyreasonand no life can possibly be saved, and many lives must inevitably besacrificed.
I will remember them. I hope to do my part faithfully.
And I hope to do mine. Now, good bye!
Though he said it with a grave smile of earnestness, and though he even putthe old man's hand to his lips, he did not part from him then. He helped him sofar to arouse the rocking figure before the dying embers, as to get a cloak andhat put upon it, and to tempt it forth to find where the bench and work werehidden that it still moaningly besought to have. He walked on the other side ofit and protected it to the courtyard of the house where the afflicted heartsohappy in the memorable time when he had revealed his own desolate heart toitoutwatched the awful night. He entered the courtyard and remained there for afew moments alone, looking up at the light in the window of her room. Before hewent away, he breathed a blessing towards it, and a Farewell.
In the black prison of the Conciergerie, the doomed of the day awaited theirfate. They were in number as the weeks of the year. Fifty-two were to roll thatafternoon on the life-tide of the city to the boundless everlasting sea. Beforetheir cells were quit of them, new occupants were appointed; before their bloodran into the blood spilled yesterday, the blood that was to mingle with theirsto-morrow was already set apart.
Two score and twelve were told off. From the farmer-general of seventy, whoseriches could not buy his life, to the seamstress of twenty, whose poverty andobscurity could not save her. Physical diseases, engendered in the vices andneglects of men, will seize on victims of all degrees; and the frightful moraldisorder, born of unspeakable suffering, intolerable oppression, and heartlessindifference, smote equally without distinction.
Charles Darnay, alone in a cell, had sustained himself with no flatteringdelusion since he came to it from the Tribunal. In every line of the narrativehe had heard, he had heard his condemnation. He had fully comprehended that nopersonal influence could possibly save him, that he was virtually sentenced bythe millions, and that units could avail him nothing.
Nevertheless, it was not easy, with the face of his beloved wife fresh beforehim, to compose his mind to what it must bear. His hold on life was strong, andit was very, very hard, to loosen; by gradual efforts and degrees unclosed alittle here, it clenched the tighter there; and when he brought his strength tobear on that hand and it yielded, this was closed again. There was a hurry, too,in all his thoughts, a turbulent and heated working of his heart, that contendedagainst resignation. If, for a moment, he did feel resigned, then his wife andchild who had to live after him, seemed to protest and to make it a selfishthing.
But, all this was at first. Before long, the consideration that there was nodisgrace in the fate he must meet, and that numbers went the same roadwrongfully, and trod it firmly every day, sprang up to stimulate him. Nextfollowed the thought that much of the future peace of mind enjoyable by the dearones, depended on his quiet fortitude. So, by degrees he calmed into the betterstate, when he could raise his thoughts much higher, and draw comfortdown.
Before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation, he had travelledthus far on his last way. Being allowed to purchase the means of writing, and alight, he sat down to write until such time as the prison lamps should beextinguished.
He wrote a long letter to Lucie, showing her that he had known nothing of herfather's imprisonment, until he had heard of it from herself, and that he hadbeen as ignorant as she of his father's and uncle's responsibility for thatmisery, until the paper had been read. He had already explained to her that hisconcealment from herself of the name he had relinquished, was the oneconditionfully intelligible nowthat her father had attached to theirbetrothal, and was the one promise he had still exacted on the morning of theirmarriage. He entreated her, for her father's sake, never to seek to know whetherher father had become oblivious of the existence of the paper, or had had itrecalled to him (for the moment, or for good), by the story of the Tower, onthat old Sunday under the dear old plane-tree in the garden. If he had preservedany definite remembrance of it, there could be no doubt that he had supposed itdestroyed with the Bastille, when he had found no mention of it among the relicsof prisoners which the populace had discovered there, and which had beendescribed to all the world. He besought herthough he added that he knew it wasneedlessto console her father, by impressing him through every tender means shecould think of, with the truth that he had done nothing for which he couldjustly reproach himself, but had uniformly forgotten himself for their jointsakes. Next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and blessing, andher overcoming of her sorrow, to devote herself to their dear child, he adjuredher, as they would meet in Heaven, to comfort her father.
To her father himself, he wrote in the same strain; but, he told her fatherthat he expressly confided his wife and child to his care. And he told him this,very strongly, with the hope of rousing him from any despondency or dangerousretrospect towards which he foresaw he might be tending.
To Mr. Lorry, he commended them all, and explained his worldly affairs. Thatdone, with many added sentences of grateful friendship and warm attachment, allwas done. He never thought of Carton. His mind was so full of the others, thathe never once thought of him.
He had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out. When helay down on his straw bed, he thought he had done with this world.
But, it beckoned him back in his sleep, and showed itself in shining forms.Free and happy, back in the old house in Soho (though it had nothing in it likethe real house), unaccountably released and light of heart, he was with Lucieagain, and she told him it was all a dream, and he had never gone away. A pauseof forgetfulness, and then he had even suffered, and had come back to her, deadand at peace, and yet there was no difference in him. Another pause of oblivion,and he awoke in the sombre morning, unconscious where he was or what hadhappened, until it flashed upon his mind, this is the day of my death!
Thus, had he come through the hours, to the day when the fifty-two heads wereto fall. And now, while he was composed, and hoped that he could meet the endwith quiet heroism, a new action began in his waking thoughts, which was verydifficult to master.
He had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life. How high itwas from the ground, how many steps it had, where he would be stood, how hewould be touched, whether the touching hands would be dyed red, which way hisface would be turned, whether he would be the first, or might be the last: theseand many similar questions, in nowise directed by his will, obtruded themselvesover and over again, countless times. Neither were they connected with fear: hewas conscious of no fear. Rather, they originated in a strange besetting desireto know what to do when the time came; a desire gigantically disproportionate tothe few swift moments to which it referred; a wondering that was more like thewondering of some other spirit within his, than his own.
The hours went on as he walked to and fro, and the clocks struck the numbershe would never hear again. Nine gone for ever, ten gone for ever, eleven gonefor ever, twelve coming on to pass away. After a hard contest with thateccentric action of thought which had last perplexed him, he had got the betterof it. He walked up and down, softly repeating their names to himself. The worstof the strife was over. He could walk up and down, free from distractingfancies, praying for himself and for them.
Twelve gone for ever.
He had been apprised that the final hour was Three, and he knew he would besummoned some time earlier, inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted heavily and slowlythrough the streets. Therefore, he resolved to keep Two before his mind, as thehour, and so to strengthen himself in the interval that he might be able, afterthat time, to strengthen others.
Walking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast, a verydifferent man from the prisoner, who had walked to and fro at La Force, he heardOne struck away from him, without surprise. The hour had measured like mostother hours. Devoutly thankful to Heaven for his recovered self-possession, hethought, There is but another now, and turned to walk again.
Footsteps in the stone passage outside the door. He stopped.
The key was put in the lock, and turned. Before the door was opened, or as itopened, a man said in a low voice, in English: He has never seen me here; Ihave kept out of his way. Go you in alone; I wait near. Lose no time!
The door was quickly opened and closed, and there stood before him face toface, quiet, intent upon him, with the light of a smile on his features, and acautionary finger on his lip, Sydney Carton.
There was something so bright and remarkable in his look, that, for the firstmoment, the prisoner misdoubted him to be an apparition of his own imagining.But, he spoke, and it was his voice; he took the prisoner's hand, and it was hisreal grasp.
Of all the people upon earth, you least expected to see me? he said.
I could not believe it to be you. I can scarcely believe it now. You arenotthe apprehension came suddenly into his minda prisoner?
No. I am accidentally possessed of a power over one of the keepers here, andin virtue of it I stand before you. I come from heryour wife, dearDarnay.
The prisoner wrung his hand.
I bring you a request from her.
What is it?
A most earnest, pressing, and emphatic entreaty, addressed to you in the mostpathetic tones of the voice so dear to you, that you well remember.
The prisoner turned his face partly aside.
You have no time to ask me why I bring it, or what it means; I have no timeto tell you. You must comply with ittake off those boots you wear, and draw onthese of mine.
There was a chair against the wall of the cell, behind the prisoner. Carton,pressing forward, had already, with the speed of lightning, got him down intoit, and stood over him, barefoot.
Draw on these boots of mine. Put your hands to them; put your will to them.Quick!
Carton, there is no escaping from this place; it never can be done. You willonly die with me. It is madness.
It would be madness if I asked you to escape; but do I? When I ask you topass out at that door, tell me it is madness and remain here. Change that cravatfor this of mine, that coat for this of mine. While you do it, let me take thisribbon from your hair, and shake out your hair like this of mine!
With wonderful quickness, and with a strength both of will and action, thatappeared quite supernatural, he forced all these changes upon him. The prisonerwas like a young child in his hands.
Carton! Dear Carton! It is madness. It cannot be accomplished, it never canbe done, it has been attempted, and has always failed. I implore you not to addyour death to the bitterness of mine.
Do I ask you, my dear Darnay, to pass the door? When I ask that, refuse.There are pen and ink and paper on this table. Is your hand steady enough towrite?
It was when you came in.
Steady it again, and write what I shall dictate. Quick, friend,quick!
Pressing his hand to his bewildered head, Darnay sat down at the table.Carton, with his right hand in his breast, stood close beside him.
Write exactly as I speak.
To whom do I address it?
To no one. Carton still had his hand in his breast.
Do I date it?
No.
The prisoner looked up, at each question. Carton, standing over him with hishand in his breast, looked down.
If you remember,' said Carton, dictating, the words that passed betweenus, long ago, you will readily comprehend this when you see it. You do rememberthem, I know. It is not in your nature to forget them.'
He was drawing his hand from his breast; the prisoner chancing to look up inhis hurried wonder as he wrote, the hand stopped, closing upon something.
Have you written forget them'? Carton asked.
I have. Is that a weapon in your hand?
No; I am not armed.
What is it in your hand?
You shall know directly. Write on; there are but a few words more. Hedictated again. I am thankful that the time has come, when I can prove them.That I do so is no subject for regret or grief.' As he said these words withhis eyes fixed on the writer, his hand slowly and softly moved down close to thewriter's face.
The pen dropped from Darnay's fingers on the table, and he looked about himvacantly.
What vapour is that? he asked.
Vapour?
Something that crossed me?
I am conscious of nothing; there can be nothing here. Take up the pen andfinish. Hurry, hurry!
As if his memory were impaired, or his faculties disordered, the prisoner madean effort to rally his attention. As he looked at Carton with clouded eyes andwith an altered manner of breathing, Cartonhis hand again in his breastlookedsteadily at him.
Hurry, hurry!
The prisoner bent over the paper, once more.
If it had been otherwise;' Carton's hand was again watchfully and softlystealing down; I never should have used the longer opportunity. If it had beenotherwise;' the hand was at the prisoner's face; I should but have had somuch the more to answer for. If it had been otherwise' Carton looked at thepen and saw it was trailing off into unintelligible signs.
Carton's hand moved back to his breast no more. The prisoner sprang up with areproachful look, but Carton's hand was close and firm at his nostrils, andCarton's left arm caught him round the waist. For a few seconds he faintlystruggled with the man who had come to lay down his life for him; but, within aminute or so, he was stretched insensible on the ground.
Quickly, but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was, Cartondressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside, combed back hishair, and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn. Then, he softly called,Enter there! Come in! and the Spy presented himself.
You see? said Carton, looking up, as he kneeled on one knee beside theinsensible figure, putting the paper in the breast: is your hazard verygreat?
Mr. Carton, the Spy answered, with a timid snap of his fingers, my hazardis not THAT, in the thick of business here, if you are true to the whole of yourbargain.
Don't fear me. I will be true to the death.
You must be, Mr. Carton, if the tale of fifty-two is to be right. Being maderight by you in that dress, I shall have no fear.
Have no fear! I shall soon be out of the way of harming you, and the restwill soon be far from here, please God! Now, get assistance and take me to thecoach.
You? said the Spy nervously.
Him, man, with whom I have exchanged. You go out at the gate by which youbrought me in?
Of course.
I was weak and faint when you brought me in, and I am fainter now you take meout. The parting interview has overpowered me. Such a thing has happened here,often, and too often. Your life is in your own hands. Quick! Callassistance!
You swear not to betray me? said the trembling Spy, as he paused for a lastmoment.
Man, man! returned Carton, stamping his foot; have I sworn by no solemn vowalready, to go through with this, that you waste the precious moments now? Takehim yourself to the courtyard you know of, place him yourself in the carriage,show him yourself to Mr. Lorry, tell him yourself to give him no restorative butair, and to remember my words of last night, and his promise of last night, anddrive away!
The Spy withdrew, and Carton seated himself at the table, resting his foreheadon his hands. The Spy returned immediately, with two men.
How, then? said one of them, contemplating the fallen figure. So afflictedto find that his friend has drawn a prize in the lottery of SainteGuillotine?
A good patriot, said the other, could hardly have been more afflicted ifthe Aristocrat had drawn a blank.
They raised the unconscious figure, placed it on a litter they had brought tothe door, and bent to carry it away.
The time is short, Evremonde, said the Spy, in a warning voice.
I know it well, answered Carton. Be careful of my friend, I entreat you,and leave me.
Come, then, my children, said Barsad. Lift him, and come away!
The door closed, and Carton was left alone. Straining his powers of listeningto the utmost, he listened for any sound that might denote suspicion or alarm.There was none. Keys turned, doors clashed, footsteps passed along distantpassages: no cry was raised, or hurry made, that seemed unusual. Breathing morefreely in a little while, he sat down at the table, and listened again until theclock struck Two.
Sounds that he was not afraid of, for he divined their meaning, then began tobe audible. Several doors were opened in succession, and finally his own. Agaoler, with a list in his hand, looked in, merely saying, Follow me,Evremonde! and he followed into a large dark room, at a distance. It was a darkwinter day, and what with the shadows within, and what with the shadows without,he could but dimly discern the others who were brought there to have their armsbound. Some were standing; some seated. Some were lamenting, and in restlessmotion; but, these were few. The great majority were silent and still, lookingfixedly at the ground.
As he stood by the wall in a dim corner, while some of the fifty-two werebrought in after him, one man stopped in passing, to embrace him, as having aknowledge of him. It thrilled him with a great dread of discovery; but the manwent on. A very few moments after that, a young woman, with a slight girlishform, a sweet spare face in which there was no vestige of colour, and largewidely opened patient eyes, rose from the seat where he had observed hersitting, and came to speak to him.
Citizen Evremonde, she said, touching him with her cold hand. I am a poorlittle seamstress, who was with you in La Force.
He murmured for answer: True. I forget what you were accused of?
Plots. Though the just Heaven knows that I am innocent of any. Is it likely?Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature like me?
The forlorn smile with which she said it, so touched him, that tears startedfrom his eyes.
I am not afraid to die, Citizen Evremonde, but I have done nothing. I am notunwilling to die, if the Republic which is to do so much good to us poor, willprofit by my death; but I do not know how that can be, Citizen Evremonde. Such apoor weak little creature!
As the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to, it warmedand softened to this pitiable girl.
I heard you were released, Citizen Evremonde. I hoped it was true?
It was. But, I was again taken and condemned.
If I may ride with you, Citizen Evremonde, will you let me hold your hand? Iam not afraid, but I am little and weak, and it will give me morecourage.
As the patient eyes were lifted to his face, he saw a sudden doubt in them,and then astonishment. He pressed the work-worn, hunger-worn young fingers, andtouched his lips.
Are you dying for him? she whispered.
And his wife and child. Hush! Yes.
O you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?
Hush! Yes, my poor sister; to the last.
 * * *
The same shadows that are falling on the prison, are falling, in that samehour of the early afternoon, on the Barrier with the crowd about it, when acoach going out of Paris drives up to be examined.
Who goes here? Whom have we within? Papers!
The papers are handed out, and read.
Alexandre Manette. Physician. French. Which is he?
This is he; this helpless, inarticulately murmuring, wandering old man pointedout.
Apparently the Citizen-Doctor is not in his right mind? The Revolution-feverwill have been too much for him?
Greatly too much for him.
Hah! Many suffer with it. Lucie. His daughter. French. Which is she?
This is she.
Apparently it must be. Lucie, the wife of Evremonde; is it not?
It is.
Hah! Evremonde has an assignation elsewhere. Lucie, her child. English. Thisis she?
She and no other.
Kiss me, child of Evremonde. Now, thou hast kissed a good Republican;something new in thy family; remember it! Sydney Carton. Advocate. English.Which is he?
He lies here, in this corner of the carriage. He, too, is pointed out.
Apparently the English advocate is in a swoon?
It is hoped he will recover in the fresher air. It is represented that he isnot in strong health, and has separated sadly from a friend who is under thedispleasure of the Republic.
Is that all? It is not a great deal, that! Many are under the displeasure ofthe Republic, and must look out at the little window. Jarvis Lorry. Banker.English. Which is he?
I am he. Necessarily, being the last.
It is Jarvis Lorry who has replied to all the previous questions. It is JarvisLorry who has alighted and stands with his hand on the coach door, replying to agroup of officials. They leisurely walk round the carriage and leisurely mountthe box, to look at what little luggage it carries on the roof; thecountry-people hanging about, press nearer to the coach doors and greedily starein; a little child, carried by its mother, has its short arm held out for it,that it may touch the wife of an aristocrat who has gone to theGuillotine.
Behold your papers, Jarvis Lorry, countersigned.
One can depart, citizen?
One can depart. Forward, my postilions! A good journey!
I salute you, citizens.And the first danger passed!
These are again the words of Jarvis Lorry, as he clasps his hands, and looksupward. There is terror in the carriage, there is weeping, there is the heavybreathing of the insensible traveller.
Are we not going too slowly? Can they not be induced to go faster? asksLucie, clinging to the old man.
It would seem like flight, my darling. I must not urge them too much; itwould rouse suspicion.
Look back, look back, and see if we are pursued!
The road is clear, my dearest. So far, we are not pursued.
Houses in twos and threes pass by us, solitary farms, ruinous buildings,dye-works, tanneries, and the like, open country, avenues of leafless trees. Thehard uneven pavement is under us, the soft deep mud is on either side.Sometimes, we strike into the skirting mud, to avoid the stones that clatter usand shake us; sometimes, we stick in ruts and sloughs there. The agony of ourimpatience is then so great, that in our wild alarm and hurry we are for gettingout and runninghidingdoing anything but stopping.
Out of the open country, in again among ruinous buildings, solitary farms,dye-works, tanneries, and the like, cottages in twos and threes, avenues ofleafless trees. Have these men deceived us, and taken us back by another road?Is not this the same place twice over? Thank Heaven, no. A village. Look back,look back, and see if we are pursued! Hush! the posting-house.
Leisurely, our four horses are taken out; leisurely, the coach stands in thelittle street, bereft of horses, and with no likelihood upon it of ever movingagain; leisurely, the new horses come into visible existence, one by one;leisurely, the new postilions follow, sucking and plaiting the lashes of theirwhips; leisurely, the old postilions count their money, make wrong additions,and arrive at dissatisfied results. All the time, our overfraught hearts arebeating at a rate that would far outstrip the fastest gallop of the fastesthorses ever foaled.
At length the new postilions are in their saddles, and the old are leftbehind. We are through the village, up the hill, and down the hill, and on thelow watery grounds. Suddenly, the postilions exchange speech with animatedgesticulation, and the horses are pulled up, almost on their haunches. We arepursued?
Ho! Within the carriage there. Speak then!
What is it? asks Mr. Lorry, looking out at window.
How many did they say?
I do not understand you.
At the last post. How many to the Guillotine to-day?
Fifty-two.
I said so! A brave number! My fellow-citizen here would have it forty-two;ten more heads are worth having. The Guillotine goes handsomely. I love it. Hiforward. Whoop!
The night comes on dark. He moves more; he is beginning to revive, and tospeak intelligibly; he thinks they are still together; he asks him, by his name,what he has in his hand. O pity us, kind Heaven, and help us! Look out, lookout, and see if we are pursued.
The wind is rushing after us, and the clouds are flying after us, and the moonis plunging after us, and the whole wild night is in pursuit of us; but, so far,we are pursued by nothing else.
In that same juncture of time when the Fifty-Two awaited their fate MadameDefarge held darkly ominous council with The Vengeance and Jacques Three of theRevolutionary Jury. Not in the wine-shop did Madame Defarge confer with theseministers, but in the shed of the wood-sawyer, erst a mender of roads. Thesawyer himself did not participate in the conference, but abided at a littledistance, like an outer satellite who was not to speak until required, or tooffer an opinion until invited.
But our Defarge, said Jacques Three, is undoubtedly a good Republican?Eh?
There is no better, the voluble Vengeance protested in her shrill notes, inFrance.
Peace, little Vengeance, said Madame Defarge, laying her hand with a slightfrown on her lieutenant's lips, hear me speak. My husband, fellow-citizen, is agood Republican and a bold man; he has deserved well of the Republic, andpossesses its confidence. But my husband has his weaknesses, and he is so weakas to relent towards this Doctor.
It is a great pity, croaked Jacques Three, dubiously shaking his head, withhis cruel fingers at his hungry mouth; it is not quite like a good citizen; itis a thing to regret.
See you, said madame, I care nothing for this Doctor, I. He may wear hishead or lose it, for any interest I have in him; it is all one to me. But, theEvremonde people are to be exterminated, and the wife and child must follow thehusband and father.
She has a fine head for it, croaked Jacques Three. I have seen blue eyesand golden hair there, and they looked charming when Samson held them up. Ogrethat he was, he spoke like an epicure.
Madame Defarge cast down her eyes, and reflected a little.
The child also, observed Jacques Three, with a meditative enjoyment of hiswords, has golden hair and blue eyes. And we seldom have a child there. It is apretty sight!
In a word, said Madame Defarge, coming out of her short abstraction, Icannot trust my husband in this matter. Not only do I feel, since last night,that I dare not confide to him the details of my projects; but also I feel thatif I delay, there is danger of his giving warning, and then they mightescape.
That must never be, croaked Jacques Three; no one must escape. We have nothalf enough as it is. We ought to have six score a day.
In a word, Madame Defarge went on, my husband has not my reason forpursuing this family to annihilation, and I have not his reason for regardingthis Doctor with any sensibility. I must act for myself, therefore. Come hither,little citizen.
The wood-sawyer, who held her in the respect, and himself in the submission,of mortal fear, advanced with his hand to his red cap.
Touching those signals, little citizen, said Madame Defarge, sternly, thatshe made to the prisoners; you are ready to bear witness to them this veryday?
Ay, ay, why not! cried the sawyer. Every day, in all weathers, from two tofour, always signalling, sometimes with the little one, sometimes without. Iknow what I know. I have seen with my eyes.
He made all manner of gestures while he spoke, as if in incidental imitationof some few of the great diversity of signals that he had never seen.
Clearly plots, said Jacques Three. Transparently!
There is no doubt of the Jury? inquired Madame Defarge, letting her eyesturn to him with a gloomy smile.
Rely upon the patriotic Jury, dear citizeness. I answer for myfellow-Jurymen.
Now, let me see, said Madame Defarge, pondering again. Yet once more! Can Ispare this Doctor to my husband? I have no feeling either way. Can I sparehim?
He would count as one head, observed Jacques Three, in a low voice. Wereally have not heads enough; it would be a pity, I think.
He was signalling with her when I saw her, argued Madame Defarge; I cannotspeak of one without the other; and I must not be silent, and trust the casewholly to him, this little citizen here. For, I am not a bad witness.
The Vengeance and Jacques Three vied with each other in their ferventprotestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of witnesses. Thelittle citizen, not to be outdone, declared her to be a celestialwitness.
He must take his chance, said Madame Defarge. No, I cannot spare him! Youare engaged at three o'clock; you are going to see the batch of to-dayexecuted.You?
The question was addressed to the wood-sawyer, who hurriedly replied in theaffirmative: seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent ofRepublicans, and that he would be in effect the most desolate of Republicans, ifanything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of smoking his afternoon pipein the contemplation of the droll national barber. He was so very demonstrativeherein, that he might have been suspected (perhaps was, by the dark eyes thatlooked contemptuously at him out of Madame Defarge's head) of having his smallindividual fears for his own personal safety, every hour in the day.
I, said madame, am equally engaged at the same place. After it is oversayat eight to-nightcome you to me, in Saint Antoine, and we will give informationagainst these people at my Section.
The wood-sawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend the citizeness.The citizeness looking at him, he became embarrassed, evaded her glance as asmall dog would have done, retreated among his wood, and hid his confusion overthe handle of his saw.
Madame Defarge beckoned the Juryman and The Vengeance a little nearer to thedoor, and there expounded her further views to them thus:
She will now be at home, awaiting the moment of his death. She will bemourning and grieving. She will be in a state of mind to impeach the justice ofthe Republic. She will be full of sympathy with its enemies. I will go toher.
What an admirable woman; what an adorable woman! exclaimed Jacques Three,rapturously. Ah, my cherished! cried The Vengeance; and embraced her.
Take you my knitting, said Madame Defarge, placing it in her lieutenant'shands, and have it ready for me in my usual seat. Keep me my usual chair. Goyou there, straight, for there will probably be a greater concourse than usual,to-day.
I willingly obey the orders of my Chief, said The Vengeance with alacrity,and kissing her cheek. You will not be late?
I shall be there before the commencement.
And before the tumbrils arrive. Be sure you are there, my soul, said TheVengeance, calling after her, for she had already turned into the street,before the tumbrils arrive!
Madame Defarge slightly waved her hand, to imply that she heard, and might berelied upon to arrive in good time, and so went through the mud, and round thecorner of the prison wall. The Vengeance and the Juryman, looking after her asshe walked away, were highly appreciative of her fine figure, and her superbmoral endowments.
There were many women at that time, upon whom the time laid a dreadfullydisfiguring hand; but, there was not one among them more to be dreaded than thisruthless woman, now taking her way along the streets. Of a strong and fearlesscharacter, of shrewd sense and readiness, of great determination, of that kindof beauty which not only seems to impart to its possessor firmness andanimosity, but to strike into others an instinctive recognition of thosequalities; the troubled time would have heaved her up, under any circumstances.But, imbued from her childhood with a brooding sense of wrong, and an inveteratehatred of a class, opportunity had developed her into a tigress. She wasabsolutely without pity. If she had ever had the virtue in her, it had quitegone out of her.
It was nothing to her, that an innocent man was to die for the sins of hisforefathers; she saw, not him, but them. It was nothing to her, that his wifewas to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that was insufficientpunishment, because they were her natural enemies and her prey, and as such hadno right to live. To appeal to her, was made hopeless by her having no sense ofpity, even for herself. If she had been laid low in the streets, in any of themany encounters in which she had been engaged, she would not have pitiedherself; nor, if she had been ordered to the axe to-morrow, would she have goneto it with any softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the manwho sent here there.
Such a heart Madame Defarge carried under her rough robe. Carelessly worn, itwas a becoming robe enough, in a certain weird way, and her dark hair lookedrich under her coarse red cap. Lying hidden in her bosom, was a loaded pistol.Lying hidden at her waist, was a sharpened dagger. Thus accoutred, and walkingwith the confident tread of such a character, and with the supple freedom of awoman who had habitually walked in her girlhood, bare-foot and bare-legged, onthe brown sea-sand, Madame Defarge took her way along the streets.
Now, when the journey of the travelling coach, at that very moment waiting forthe completion of its load, had been planned out last night, the difficulty oftaking Miss Pross in it had much engaged Mr. Lorry's attention. It was notmerely desirable to avoid overloading the coach, but it was of the highestimportance that the time occupied in examining it and its passengers, should bereduced to the utmost; since their escape might depend on the saving of only afew seconds here and there. Finally, he had proposed, after anxiousconsideration, that Miss Pross and Jerry, who were at liberty to leave the city,should leave it at three o'clock in the lightest- wheeled conveyance known tothat period. Unencumbered with luggage, they would soon overtake the coach, and,passing it and preceding it on the road, would order its horses in advance, andgreatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours of the night, whendelay was the most to be dreaded.
Seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that pressingemergency, Miss Pross hailed it with joy. She and Jerry had beheld the coachstart, had known who it was that Solomon brought, had passed some ten minutes intortures of suspense, and were now concluding their arrangements to follow thecoach, even as Madame Defarge, taking her way through the streets, now drewnearer and nearer to the else-deserted lodging in which they held theirconsultation.
Now what do you think, Mr. Cruncher, said Miss Pross, whose agitation was sogreat that she could hardly speak, or stand, or move, or live: what do youthink of our not starting from this courtyard? Another carriage having alreadygone from here to-day, it might awaken suspicion.
My opinion, miss, returned Mr. Cruncher, is as you're right. Likewise wotI'll stand by you, right or wrong.
I am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures, said MissPross, wildly crying, that I am incapable of forming any plan. Are YOU capableof forming any plan, my dear good Mr. Cruncher?
Respectin' a future spear o' life, miss, returned Mr. Cruncher, I hope so.Respectin' any present use o' this here blessed old head o' mine, I think not.Would you do me the favour, miss, to take notice o' two promises and wows wot itis my wishes fur to record in this here crisis?
Oh, for gracious sake! cried Miss Pross, still wildly crying, record themat once, and get them out of the way, like an excellent man.
First, said Mr. Cruncher, who was all in a tremble, and who spoke with anashy and solemn visage, them poor things well out o' this, never no more will Ido it, never no more!
I am quite sure, Mr. Cruncher, returned Miss Pross, that you never will doit again, whatever it is, and I beg you not to think it necessary to mentionmore particularly what it is.
No, miss, returned Jerry, it shall not be named to you. Second: them poorthings well out o' this, and never no more will I interfere with Mrs. Cruncher'sflopping, never no more!
Whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be, said Miss Pross, striving todry her eyes and compose herself, I have no doubt it is best that Mrs. Crunchershould have it entirely under her own superintendence. O my poordarlings!
I go so far as to say, miss, moreover, proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with a mostalarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpitand let my words be took downand took to Mrs. Cruncher through yourselfthat wot my opinions respectin'flopping has undergone a change, and that wot I only hope with all my heart asMrs. Cruncher may be a flopping at the present time.
There, there, there! I hope she is, my dear man, cried the distracted MissPross, and I hope she finds it answering her expectations.
Forbid it, proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with additional solemnity, additionalslowness, and additional tendency to hold forth and hold out, as anything wot Ihave ever said or done should be wisited on my earnest wishes for them poorcreeturs now! Forbid it as we shouldn't all flop (if it was anyways conwenient)to get em out o' this here dismal risk! Forbid it, miss! Wot I say, for-BIDit! This was Mr. Cruncher's conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour tofind a better one.
And still Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer andnearer.
If we ever get back to our native land, said Miss Pross, you may rely uponmy telling Mrs. Cruncher as much as I may be able to remember and understand ofwhat you have so impressively said; and at all events you may be sure that Ishall bear witness to your being thoroughly in earnest at this dreadful time.Now, pray let us think! My esteemed Mr. Cruncher, let us think!
Still, Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer andnearer.
If you were to go before, said Miss Pross, and stop the vehicle and horsesfrom coming here, and were to wait somewhere for me; wouldn't that bebest?
Mr. Cruncher thought it might be best.
Where could you wait for me? asked Miss Pross.
Mr. Cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but TempleBar. Alas! Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away, and Madame Defarge was drawingvery near indeed.
By the cathedral door, said Miss Pross. Would it be much out of the way, totake me in, near the great cathedral door between the two towers?
No, miss, answered Mr. Cruncher.
Then, like the best of men, said Miss Pross, go to the posting-housestraight, and make that change.
I am doubtful, said Mr. Cruncher, hesitating and shaking his head, aboutleaving of you, you see. We don't know what may happen.
Heaven knows we don't, returned Miss Pross, but have no fear for me. Takeme in at the cathedral, at Three o'Clock, or as near it as you can, and I amsure it will be better than our going from here. I feel certain of it. There!Bless you, Mr. Cruncher! Think-not of me, but of the lives that may depend onboth of us!
This exordium, and Miss Pross's two hands in quite agonised entreaty claspinghis, decided Mr. Cruncher. With an encouraging nod or two, he immediately wentout to alter the arrangements, and left her by herself to follow as she hadproposed.
The having originated a precaution which was already in course of execution,was a great relief to Miss Pross. The necessity of composing her appearance sothat it should attract no special notice in the streets, was another relief. Shelooked at her watch, and it was twenty minutes past two. She had no time tolose, but must get ready at once.
Afraid, in her extreme perturbation, of the loneliness of the deserted rooms,and of half-imagined faces peeping from behind every open door in them, MissPross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes, which were swollenand red. Haunted by her feverish apprehensions, she could not bear to have hersight obscured for a minute at a time by the dripping water, but constantlypaused and looked round to see that there was no one watching her. In one ofthose pauses she recoiled and cried out, for she saw a figure standing in theroom.
The basin fell to the ground broken, and the water flowed to the feet ofMadame Defarge. By strange stern ways, and through much staining blood, thosefeet had come to meet that water.
Madame Defarge looked coldly at her, and said, The wife of Evremonde; whereis she?
It flashed upon Miss Pross's mind that the doors were all standing open, andwould suggest the flight. Her first act was to shut them. There were four in theroom, and she shut them all. She then placed herself before the door of thechamber which Lucie had occupied.
Madame Defarge's dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement, andrested on her when it was finished. Miss Pross had nothing beautiful about her;years had not tamed the wildness, or softened the grimness, of her appearance;but, she too was a determined woman in her different way, and she measuredMadame Defarge with her eyes, every inch.
You might, from your appearance, be the wife of Lucifer, said Miss Pross, inher breathing. Nevertheless, you shall not get the better of me. I am anEnglishwoman.
Madame Defarge looked at her scornfully, but still with something of MissPross's own perception that they two were at bay. She saw a tight, hard, wirywoman before her, as Mr. Lorry had seen in the same figure a woman with a stronghand, in the years gone by. She knew full well that Miss Pross was the family'sdevoted friend; Miss Pross knew full well that Madame Defarge was the family'smalevolent enemy.
On my way yonder, said Madame Defarge, with a slight movement of her handtowards the fatal spot, where they reserve my chair and my knitting for me, Iam come to make my compliments to her in passing. I wish to see her.
I know that your intentions are evil, said Miss Pross, and you may dependupon it, I'll hold my own against them.
Each spoke in her own language; neither understood the other's words; bothwere very watchful, and intent to deduce from look and manner, what theunintelligible words meant.
It will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this moment,said Madame Defarge. Good patriots will know what that means. Let me see her.Go tell her that I wish to see her. Do you hear?
If those eyes of yours were bed-winches, returned Miss Pross, and I was anEnglish four-poster, they shouldn't loose a splinter of me. No, you wickedforeign woman; I am your match.
Madame Defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in detail;but, she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set atnaught.
Woman imbecile and pig-like! said Madame Defarge, frowning. I take noanswer from you. I demand to see her. Either tell her that I demand to see her,or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her! This, with an angryexplanatory wave of her right arm.
I little thought, said Miss Pross, that I should ever want to understandyour nonsensical language; but I would give all I have, except the clothes Iwear, to know whether you suspect the truth, or any part of it.
Neither of them for a single moment released the other's eyes. Madame Defargehad not moved from the spot where she stood when Miss Pross first became awareof her; but, she now advanced one step.
I am a Briton, said Miss Pross, I am desperate. I don't care an EnglishTwopence for myself. I know that the longer I keep you here, the greater hopethere is for my Ladybird. I'll not leave a handful of that dark hair upon yourhead, if you lay a finger on me!
Thus Miss Pross, with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes betweenevery rapid sentence, and every rapid sentence a whole breath. Thus Miss Pross,who had never struck a blow in her life.
But, her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought theirrepressible tears into her eyes. This was a courage that Madame Defarge solittle comprehended as to mistake for weakness. Ha, ha! she laughed, you poorwretch! What are you worth! I address myself to that Doctor. Then she raisedher voice and called out, Citizen Doctor! Wife of Evremonde! Child ofEvremonde! Any person but this miserable fool, answer the CitizenessDefarge!
Perhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in theexpression of Miss Pross's face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from eithersuggestion, whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone. Three of the doorsshe opened swiftly, and looked in.
Those rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing, there areodds and ends upon the ground. There is no one in that room behind you! Let melook.
Never! said Miss Pross, who understood the request as perfectly as MadameDefarge understood the answer.
If they are not in that room, they are gone, and can be pursued and broughtback, said Madame Defarge to herself.
As long as you don't know whether they are in that room or not, you areuncertain what to do, said Miss Pross to herself; and you shall not know that,if I can prevent your knowing it; and know that, or not know that, you shall notleave here while I can hold you.
I have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me, I willtear you to pieces, but I will have you from that door, said MadameDefarge.
We are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard, we are notlikely to be heard, and I pray for bodily strength to keep you here, while everyminute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to my darling, saidMiss Pross.
Madame Defarge made at the door. Miss Pross, on the instinct of the moment,seized her round the waist in both her arms, and held her tight. It was in vainfor Madame Defarge to struggle and to strike; Miss Pross, with the vigoroustenacity of love, always so much stronger than hate, clasped her tight, and evenlifted her from the floor in the struggle that they had. The two hands of MadameDefarge buffeted and tore her face; but, Miss Pross, with her head down, heldher round the waist, and clung to her with more than the hold of a drowningwoman.
Soon, Madame Defarge's hands ceased to strike, and felt at her encircledwaist. It is under my arm, said Miss Pross, in smothered tones, you shall notdraw it. I am stronger than you, I bless Heaven for it. I hold you till one orother of us faints or dies!
Madame Defarge's hands were at her bosom. Miss Pross looked up, saw what itwas, struck at it, struck out a flash and a crash, and stood aloneblinded withsmoke.
All this was in a second. As the smoke cleared, leaving an awful stillness, itpassed out on the air, like the soul of the furious woman whose body laylifeless on the ground.
In the first fright and horror of her situation, Miss Pross passed the body asfar from it as she could, and ran down the stairs to call for fruitless help.Happily, she bethought herself of the consequences of what she did, in time tocheck herself and go back. It was dreadful to go in at the door again; but, shedid go in, and even went near it, to get the bonnet and other things that shemust wear. These she put on, out on the staircase, first shutting and lockingthe door and taking away the key. She then sat down on the stairs a few momentsto breathe and to cry, and then got up and hurried away.
By good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet, or she could hardly have gonealong the streets without being stopped. By good fortune, too, she was naturallyso peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement like any other woman. Sheneeded both advantages, for the marks of gripping fingers were deep in her face,and her hair was torn, and her dress (hastily composed with unsteady hands) wasclutched and dragged a hundred ways.
In crossing the bridge, she dropped the door key in the river. Arriving at thecathedral some few minutes before her escort, and waiting there, she thought,what if the key were already taken in a net, what if it were identified, what ifthe door were opened and the remains discovered, what if she were stopped at thegate, sent to prison, and charged with murder! In the midst of these flutteringthoughts, the escort appeared, took her in, and took her away.
Is there any noise in the streets? she asked him.
The usual noises, Mr. Cruncher replied; and looked surprised by the questionand by her aspect.
I don't hear you, said Miss Pross. What do you say?
It was in vain for Mr. Cruncher to repeat what he said; Miss Pross could nothear him. So I'll nod my head, thought Mr. Cruncher, amazed, at all eventsshe'll see that. And she did.
Is there any noise in the streets now? asked Miss Pross again,presently.
Again Mr. Cruncher nodded his head.
I don't hear it.
Gone deaf in an hour? said Mr. Cruncher, ruminating, with his mind muchdisturbed; wot's come to her?
I feel, said Miss Pross, as if there had been a flash and a crash, and thatcrash was the last thing I should ever hear in this life.
Blest if she ain't in a queer condition! said Mr. Cruncher, more and moredisturbed. Wot can she have been a takin', to keep her courage up? Hark!There's the roll of them dreadful carts! You can hear that, miss?
I can hear, said Miss Pross, seeing that he spoke to her, nothing. O, mygood man, there was first a great crash, and then a great stillness, and thatstillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable, never to be broken any more aslong as my life lasts.
If she don't hear the roll of those dreadful carts, now very nigh theirjourney's end, said Mr. Cruncher, glancing over his shoulder, it's my opinionthat indeed she never will hear anything else in this world.
And indeed she never did.
Along the Paris streets, the death-carts rumble, hollow and harsh. Sixtumbrils carry the day's wine to La Guillotine. All the devouring and insatiateMonsters imagined since imagination could record itself, are fused in the onerealisation, Guillotine. And yet there is not in France, with its rich varietyof soil and climate, a blade, a leaf, a root, a sprig, a peppercorn, which willgrow to maturity under conditions more certain than those that have producedthis horror. Crush humanity out of shape once more, under similar hammers, andit will twist itself into the same tortured forms. Sow the same seed ofrapacious license and oppression over again, and it will surely yield the samefruit according to its kind.
Six tumbrils roll along the streets. Change these back again to what theywere, thou powerful enchanter, Time, and they shall be seen to be the carriagesof absolute monarchs, the equipages of feudal nobles, the toilettes of flaringJezebels, the churches that are not my father's house but dens of thieves, thehuts of millions of starving peasants! No; the great magician who majesticallyworks out the appointed order of the Creator, never reverses histransformations. If thou be changed into this shape by the will of God, saythe seers to the enchanted, in the wise Arabian stories, then remain so! But,if thou wear this form through mere passing conjuration, then resume thy formeraspect! Changeless and hopeless, the tumbrils roll along.
As the sombre wheels of the six carts go round, they seem to plough up a longcrooked furrow among the populace in the streets. Ridges of faces are thrown tothis side and to that, and the ploughs go steadily onward. So used are theregular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle, that in many windows thereare no people, and in some the occupation of the hands is not so much assuspended, while the eyes survey the faces in the tumbrils. Here and there, theinmate has visitors to see the sight; then he points his finger, with somethingof the complacency of a curator or authorised exponent, to this cart and tothis, and seems to tell who sat here yesterday, and who there the daybefore.
Of the riders in the tumbrils, some observe these things, and all things ontheir last roadside, with an impassive stare; others, with a lingering interestin the ways of life and men. Some, seated with drooping heads, are sunk insilent despair; again, there are some so heedful of their looks that they castupon the multitude such glances as they have seen in theatres, and in pictures.Several close their eyes, and think, or try to get their straying thoughtstogether. Only one, and he a miserable creature, of a crazed aspect, is soshattered and made drunk by horror, that he sings, and tries to dance. Not oneof the whole number appeals by look or gesture, to the pity of thepeople.
There is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils, and facesare often turned up to some of them, and they are asked some question. It wouldseem to be always the same question, for, it is always followed by a press ofpeople towards the third cart. The horsemen abreast of that cart, frequentlypoint out one man in it with their swords. The leading curiosity is, to knowwhich is he; he stands at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down, toconverse with a mere girl who sits on the side of the cart, and holds his hand.He has no curiosity or care for the scene about him, and always speaks to thegirl. Here and there in the long street of St. Honore, cries are raised againsthim. If they move him at all, it is only to a quiet smile, as he shakes his haira little more loosely about his face. He cannot easily touch his face, his armsbeing bound.
On the steps of a church, awaiting the coming-up of the tumbrils, stands theSpy and prison-sheep. He looks into the first of them: not there. He looks intothe second: not there. He already asks himself, Has he sacrificed me? when hisface clears, as he looks into the third.
Which is Evremonde? says a man behind him.
That. At the back there.
With his hand in the girl's?
Yes.
The man cries, Down, Evremonde! To the Guillotine all aristocrats! Down,Evremonde!
Hush, hush! the Spy entreats him, timidly.
And why not, citizen?
He is going to pay the forfeit: it will be paid in five minutes more. Let himbe at peace.
But the man continuing to exclaim, Down, Evremonde! the face of Evremonde isfor a moment turned towards him. Evremonde then sees the Spy, and looksattentively at him, and goes his way.
The clocks are on the stroke of three, and the furrow ploughed among thepopulace is turning round, to come on into the place of execution, and end. Theridges thrown to this side and to that, now crumble in and close behind the lastplough as it passes on, for all are following to the Guillotine. In front of it,seated in chairs, as in a garden of public diversion, are a number of women,busily knitting. On one of the fore-most chairs, stands The Vengeance, lookingabout for her friend.
Therese! she cries, in her shrill tones. Who has seen her? ThereseDefarge!
She never missed before, says a knitting-woman of the sisterhood.
No; nor will she miss now, cries The Vengeance, petulantly.Therese.
Louder, the woman recommends.
Ay! Louder, Vengeance, much louder, and still she will scarcely hear thee.Louder yet, Vengeance, with a little oath or so added, and yet it will hardlybring her. Send other women up and down to seek her, lingering somewhere; andyet, although the messengers have done dread deeds, it is questionable whetherof their own wills they will go far enough to find her!
Bad Fortune! cries The Vengeance, stamping her foot in the chair, and hereare the tumbrils! And Evremonde will be despatched in a wink, and she not here!See her knitting in my hand, and her empty chair ready for her. I cry withvexation and disappointment!
As The Vengeance descends from her elevation to do it, the tumbrils begin todischarge their loads. The ministers of Sainte Guillotine are robed and ready.Crash!A head is held up, and the knitting-women who scarcely lifted their eyesto look at it a moment ago when it could think and speak, count One.
The second tumbril empties and moves on; the third comes up. Crash! And theknitting-women, never faltering or pausing in their Work, count Two.
The supposed Evremonde descends, and the seamstress is lifted out next afterhim. He has not relinquished her patient hand in getting out, but still holds itas he promised. He gently places her with her back to the crashing engine thatconstantly whirrs up and falls, and she looks into his face and thankshim.
But for you, dear stranger, I should not be so composed, for I am naturally apoor little thing, faint of heart; nor should I have been able to raise mythoughts to Him who was put to death, that we might have hope and comfort hereto-day. I think you were sent to me by Heaven.
Or you to me, says Sydney Carton. Keep your eyes upon me, dear child, andmind no other object.
I mind nothing while I hold your hand. I shall mind nothing when I let it go,if they are rapid.
They will be rapid. Fear not!
The two stand in the fast-thinning throng of victims, but they speak as ifthey were alone. Eye to eye, voice to voice, hand to hand, heart to heart, thesetwo children of the Universal Mother, else so wide apart and differing, havecome together on the dark highway, to repair home together, and to rest in herbosom.
Brave and generous friend, will you let me ask you one last question? I amvery ignorant, and it troubles mejust a little.
Tell me what it is.
I have a cousin, an only relative and an orphan, like myself, whom I lovevery dearly. She is five years younger than I, and she lives in a farmer's housein the south country. Poverty parted us, and she knows nothing of my fatefor Icannot writeand if I could, how should I tell her! It is better as itis.
Yes, yes: better as it is.
What I have been thinking as we came along, and what I am still thinking now,as I look into your kind strong face which gives me so much support, is this:If the Republic really does good to the poor, and they come to be less hungry,and in all ways to suffer less, she may live a long time: she may even live tobe old.
What then, my gentle sister?
Do you think: the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much endurance,fill with tears, and the lips part a little more and tremble: that it will seemlong to me, while I wait for her in the better land where I trust both you and Iwill be mercifully sheltered?
It cannot be, my child; there is no Time there, and no trouble there.
You comfort me so much! I am so ignorant. Am I to kiss you now? Is the momentcome?
Yes.
She kisses his lips; he kisses hers; they solemnly bless each other. The sparehand does not tremble as he releases it; nothing worse than a sweet, brightconstancy is in the patient face. She goes next before himis gone; theknitting-women count Twenty-Two.
I am the Resurrection and the Life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in me,though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in meshall never die.
The murmuring of many voices, the upturning of many faces, the pressing on ofmany footsteps in the outskirts of the crowd, so that it swells forward in amass, like one great heave of water, all flashes away. Twenty-Three.

They said of him, about the city that night, that it was the peacefullestman's face ever beheld there. Many added that he looked sublime andprophetic.
One of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axea womanhad asked at thefoot of the same scaffold, not long before, to be allowed to write down thethoughts that were inspiring her. If he had given any utterance to his, and theywere prophetic, they would have been these:
I see Barsad, and Cly, Defarge, The Vengeance, the Juryman, the Judge, longranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the destruction of the old,perishing by this retributive instrument, before it shall cease out of itspresent use. I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from thisabyss, and, in their struggles to be truly free, in their triumphs and defeats,through long years to come, I see the evil of this time and of the previous timeof which this is the natural birth, gradually making expiation for itself andwearing out.
I see the lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful, prosperousand happy, in that England which I shall see no more. I see Her with a childupon her bosom, who bears my name. I see her father, aged and bent, butotherwise restored, and faithful to all men in his healing office, and at peace.I see the good old man, so long their friend, in ten years' time enriching themwith all he has, and passing tranquilly to his reward.
I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of theirdescendants, generations hence. I see her, an old woman, weeping for me on theanniversary of this day. I see her and her husband, their course done, lyingside by side in their last earthly bed, and I know that each was not morehonoured and held sacred in the other's soul, than I was in the souls ofboth.
I see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name, a man winninghis way up in that path of life which once was mine. I see him winning it sowell, that my name is made illustrious there by the light of his. I see theblots I threw upon it, faded away. I see him, fore-most of just judges andhonoured men, bringing a boy of my name, with a forehead that I know and goldenhair, to this placethen fair to look upon, with not a trace of this day'sdisfigurementand I hear him tell the child my story, with a tender and afaltering voice.
It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far,far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.
