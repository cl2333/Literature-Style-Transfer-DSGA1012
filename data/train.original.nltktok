There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face , on the throne of England .
 there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face , on the throne of France .
 In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes , that things in general were settled for ever .
 It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five .
 Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period , as at this .
 MrsSouthcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth blessed birthday , of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster .
 Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years , after rapping out its messages , as the spirits of this very year last past supernaturally deficient in originality rapped out theirs .
 Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People , from a congress of British subjects in America : which , strange to relate , have proved more important to the human race than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane brood .
 With drooping heads and tremulous tails , they mashed their way through the thick mud , floundering and stumbling between whiles , as if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints .
 As often as the driver rested them and brought them to a stand , with a wary Wo-ho .
 the near leader violently shook his head and everything upon itlike an unusually emphatic horse , denying that the coach could be got up the hill .
 Whenever the leader made this rattle , the passenger started , as a nervous passenger might , and was disturbed in mind .
 There was a steaming mist in all the hollows , and it had roamed in its forlornness up the hill , like an evil spirit , seeking rest and finding none .
 A clammy and intensely cold mist , it made its slow way through the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another , as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do .
 It was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings , and a few yards of road .
 and the reek of the labouring horses steamed into it , as if they had made it all .
 Two other passengers , besides the one , were plodding up the hill by the side of the mail .
 All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the ears , and wore jack-boots .
 Not one of the three could have said , from anything he saw , what either of the other two was like .
 and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind , as from the eyes of the body , of his two companions .
 In those days , travellers were very shy of being confidential on a short notice , for anybody on the road might be a robber or in league with robbers .
 As to the latter , when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in the Captainës pay , ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable non-descript , it was the likeliest thing upon the cards .
 So the guard of the Dover mail thought to himself , that Friday night in November , one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five , lumbering up Shooter's Hill , as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail , beating his feet , and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him , where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols , deposited on a substratum of cutlass .
 Halloa .
 the guard replied .
 What o'clock do you make it , Joe .
 Ten minutes , good , past eleven .
 The emphatic horse , cut short by the whip in a most decided negative , made a decided scramble for it , and the three other horses followed suit .
 Once more , the Dover mail struggled on , with the jack-boots of its passengers squashing along by its side .
 They had stopped when the coach stopped , and they kept close company with it .
 If any one of the three had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead into the mist and darkness , he would have put himself in a fair way of getting shot instantly as a highwayman .
 What do you say , Tom .
 They both listened .
 I say a horse at a canter coming up , Joe .
 I say a horse at a gallop , Tom , returned the guard , leaving his hold of the door , and mounting nimbly to his place .
 Gentlemen .
 In the king's name , all of you .
 With this hurried adjuration , he cocked his blunderbuss , and stood on the offensive .
 The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring of the coach , added to the stillness of the night , made it very quiet indeed .
 The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to the coach , as if it were in a state of agitation .
 The hearts of the passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard .
 but at any rate , the quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath , and holding the breath , and having the pulses quickened by expectation .
 The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill .
 Never you mind what it is .
 the guard retorted .
 What are you .
 Is that the Dover mail .
 Why do you want to know .
 I want a passenger , if it is .
 What passenger .
 MrJarvis Lorry .
 Our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name .
 The guard , the coachman , and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully .
 What is the matter .
 asked the passenger , then , with mildly quavering speech .
 Who wants me .
 Is it Jerry .
 I don't like Jerry's voice , if it is Jerry , growled the guard to himself .
 He's hoarser than suits me , is Jerry .
 Yes , MrLorry .
 What is the matter .
 The figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist , and came to the side of the mail , where the passenger stood .
 The rider stooped , and , casting up his eyes at the guard , handed the passenger a small folded paper .
 The rider's horse was blown , and both horse and rider were covered with mud , from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of the man .
 Guard .
 said the passenger , in a tone of quiet business confidence .
 There is nothing to apprehend .
 I belong to Tellson's Bank .
 You must know Tellson's Bank in London .
 I am going to Paris on business .
 A crown to drink .
 I may read this .
 If so be as you're quick , sir .
 He opened it in the light of the coach-lamp on that side , and readfirst to himself and then aloud : ëWait at Dover for Mam'selle .
 It's not long , you see , guard .
 Jerry , say that my answer was , RECALLED TO LIFE .
 Jerry started in his saddle .
 That's a Blazing strange answer , too , said he , at his hoarsest .
 Take that message back , and they will know that I received this , as well as if I wrote .
 Make the best of your way .
 Good night .
 With those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in .
 not at all assisted by his fellow-passengers , who had expeditiously secreted their watches and purses in their boots , and were now making a general pretence of being asleep .
 With no more definite purpose than to escape the hazard of originating any other kind of action .
 Tom .
 softly over the coach roof .
 Hallo , Joe .
 Did you hear the message .
 I did , Joe .
 What did you make of it , Tom .
 Nothing at all , Joe .
 That's a coincidence , too , the guard mused , for I made the same of it myself .
 A wonderful fact to reflect upon , that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other .
 A solemn consideration , when I enter a great city by night , that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret .
 that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret .
 that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there , is , in some of its imaginings , a secret to the heart nearest it .
 Something of the awfulness , even of Death itself , is referable to this .
 No more can I turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved , and vainly hope in time to read it all .
 No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable water , wherein , as momentary lights glanced into it , I have had glimpses of buried treasure and other things submerged .
 It was appointed that the book should shut with a spring , for ever and for ever , when I had read but a page .
 It was appointed that the water should be locked in an eternal frost , when the light was playing on its surface , and I stood in ignorance on the shore .
 My friend is dead , my neighbour is dead , my love , the darling of my soul , is dead .
 it is the inexorable consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that individuality , and which I shall carry in mine to my life's end .
 In any of the burial-places of this city through which I pass , is there a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are , in their innermost personality , to me , or than I am to them .
 The messenger rode back at an easy trot , stopping pretty often at ale-houses by the way to drink , but evincing a tendency to keep his own counsel , and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes .
 He had eyes that assorted very well with that decoration , being of a surface black , with no depth in the colour or form , and much too near togetheras if they were afraid of being found out in something , singly , if they kept too far apart .
 They had a sinister expression , under an old cocked-hat like a three-cornered spittoon , and over a great muffler for the chin and throat , which descended nearly to the wearer's knees .
 When he stopped for drink , he moved this muffler with his left hand , only while he poured his liquor in with his right .
 as soon as that was done , he muffled again .
 His message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain , several times , to take off his hat to scratch his head .
 Except on the crown , which was raggedly bald , he had stiff , black hair , standing jaggedly all over it , and growing down hill almost to his broad , blunt nose .
 It was so like Smith's work , so much more like the top of a strongly spiked wall than a head of hair , that the best of players at leap-frog might have declined him , as the most dangerous man in the world to go over .
 What time , the mail-coach lumbered , jolted , rattled , and bumped upon its tedious way , with its three fellow-inscrutables inside .
 To whom , likewise , the shadows of the night revealed themselves , in the forms their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested .
 But , though the bank was almost always with him , and though the coach in a confused way , like the presence of pain under an opiate was always with him , there was another current of impression that never ceased to run , all through the night .
 He was on his way to dig some one out of a grave .
 Now , which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him was the true face of the buried person , the shadows of the night did not indicate .
 but they were all the faces of a man of five-and-forty by years , and they differed principally in the passions they expressed , and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state .
 Pride , contempt , defiance , stubbornness , submission , lamentation , succeeded one another .
 so did varieties of sunken cheek , cadaverous colour , emaciated hands and figures .
 But the face was in the main one face , and every head was prematurely white .
 A hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this spectre : 
.
 Buried how long .
 The answer was always the same : Almost eighteen years .
 You had abandoned all hope of being dug out .
 Long ago .
 You know that you are recalled to life .
 They tell me so .
 I hope you care to live .
 I can't say .
 Shall I show her to you .
 Will you come and see her .
 The answers to this question were various and contradictory .
 Sometimes the broken reply was , Wait .
 It would kill me if I saw her too soon .
 Sometimes , it was given in a tender rain of tears , and then it was , Take me to her .
 Sometimes it was staring and bewildered , and then it was , I don't know her .
 I don't understand .
 Yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain , on the moving patch of light from the lamps , and the hedge at the roadside retreating by jerks , the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train of the night shadows within .
 The real Banking-house by Temple Bar , the real business of the past day , the real strong rooms , the real express sent after him , and the real message returned , would all be there .
 Out of the midst of them , the ghostly face would rise , and he would accost it again .
 Buried how long .
 Almost eighteen years .
 I hope you care to live .
 I can't say .
 Buried how long .
 Almost eighteen years .
 You had abandoned all hope of being dug out .
 Long ago .
 The words were still in his hearing as just spokendistinctly in his hearing as ever spoken words had been in his lifewhen the weary passenger started to the consciousness of daylight , and found that the shadows of the night were gone .
 He lowered the window , and looked out at the rising sun .
 There was a ridge of ploughed land , with a plough upon it where it had been left last night when the horses were unyoked .
 beyond , a quiet coppice-wood , in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained upon the trees .
 Though the earth was cold and wet , the sky was clear , and the sun rose bright , placid , and beautiful .
 Eighteen years .
 said the passenger , looking at the sun .
 Gracious Creator of day .
 To be buried alive for eighteen years .
 When the mail got successfully to Dover , in the course of the forenoon , the head drawer at the Royal George Hotel opened the coach-door as his custom was .
 He did it with some flourish of ceremony , for a mail journey from London in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous traveller upon .
 There will be a packet to Calais , tomorrow , drawer .
 Yes , sir , if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair .
 The tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon , sir .
 Bed , sir .
 The coffee-room had no other occupant , that forenoon , than the gentleman in brown .
 His breakfast-table was drawn before the fire , and as he sat , with its light shining on him , waiting for the meal , he sat so still , that he might have been sitting for his portrait .
 Completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait , MrLorry dropped off to sleep .
 The arrival of his breakfast roused him , and he said to the drawer , as he moved his chair to it : 
.
 I wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any time to-day .
 She may ask for MrJarvis Lorry , or she may only ask for a gentleman from Tellson's Bank .
 Please to let me know .
 Yes , sir .
 Tellson's Bank in London , sir .
 Yes .
 Yes , sir .
 We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt London and Paris , sir .
 A vast deal of travelling , sir , in Tellson and Company's House .
 Yes .
 We are quite a French House , as well as an English one .
 Yes , sir .
 Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself , I think , sir .
 Not of late years .
 It is fifteen years since wesince Icame last from France .
 Indeed , sir .
 That was before my time here , sir .
 Before our people's time here , sir .
 The George was in other hands at that time , sir .
 I believe so .
 But I would hold a pretty wager , sir , that a House like Tellson and Company was flourishing , a matter of fifty , not to speak of fifteen years ago .
 You might treble that , and say a hundred and fifty , yet not be far from the truth .
 Indeed , sir .
 A bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no harm , otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work .
 MrLorry had been idle a long time , and had just poured out his last glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has got to the end of a bottle , when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow street , and rumbled into the inn-yard .
 He set down his glass untouched .
 This is Mam'selle .
 said he .
 In a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that Miss Manette had arrived from London , and would be happy to see the gentleman from Tellson's .
 So soon .
 The gentleman from Tellson's had nothing left for it but to empty his glass with an air of stolid desperation , settle his odd little flaxen wig at the ears , and follow the waiter to Miss Manette's apartment .
 It was a large , dark room , furnished in a funereal manner with black horsehair , and loaded with heavy dark tables .
 These had been oiled and oiled , until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room were gloomily reflected on every leaf .
 as if THEY were buried , in deep graves of black mahogany , and no light to speak of could be expected from them until they were dug out .
 I kiss your hand , miss , said MrLorry , with the manners of an earlier date , as he made his formal bow again , and took his seat .
 I received a letter from the Bank , sir , yesterday , informing me that some intelligenceor discovery
.
 rendered it necessary that I should go to Paris , there to communicate with a gentleman of the Bank , so good as to be despatched to Paris for the purpose .
 Myself .
 As I was prepared to hear , sir .
 She curtseyed to him young ladies made curtseys in those days , with a pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he was than she .
 He made her another bow .
 I was happy , said MrLorry , to be entrusted with the charge .
 I shall be more happy to execute it .
 Naturally , said MrLorry .
 After a pause , he added , again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the ears , It is very difficult to begin .
 Are you quite a stranger to me , sir .
 Am I not .
 MrLorry opened his hands , and extended them outwards with an argumentative smile .
 If you please , sir .
 Miss Manette , I am a man of business .
 I have a business charge to acquit myself of .
 In your reception of it , don't heed me any more than if I was a speaking machinetruly , I am not much else .
 I will , with your leave , relate to you , miss , the story of one of our customers .
 Story .
 Not of Beauvais .
 At that timeI may ask , at what time , sir .
 I speak , miss , of twenty years ago .
 He marriedan English ladyand I was one of the trustees .
 His affairs , like the affairs of many other French gentlemen and French families , were entirely in Tellson's hands .
 In a similar way I am , or I have been , trustee of one kind or other for scores of our customers .
 These are mere business relations , miss .
 there is no friendship in them , no particular interest , nothing like sentiment .
 I have passed from one to another , in the course of my business life , just as I pass from one of our customers to another in the course of my business day .
 in short , I have no feelings .
 I am a mere machine to go on .
 After this odd description of his daily routine of employment , MrLorry flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands which was most unnecessary , for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was before , and resumed his former attitude .
 So far , miss as you have remarked , this is the story of your regretted father .
 Now comes the difference .
 If your father had not died when he didDon't be frightened .
 How you start .
 Her look so discomposed him that he stopped , wandered , and began anew : 
 I entreat you to tell me more , sir .
 I will .
 I am going to .
 You can bear it .
 I can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this moment .
 The little child was a daughter , sir .
 For the truth .
 O dear , good , compassionate sir , for the truth .
 Aa matter of business .
 You confuse me , and how can I transact business if I am confused .
 Let us be clear-headed .
 If you could kindly mention now , for instance , what nine times ninepence are , or how many shillings in twenty guineas , it would be so encouraging .
 I should be so much more at my ease about your state of mind .
 He felt his wrist held closer , and he stopped .
 The expression in the forehead , which had so particularly attracted his notice , and which was now immovable , had deepened into one of pain and horror .
 A shiver ran through her frame , and from it through his .
 She said , in a low , distinct , awe-stricken voice , as if she were saying it in a dream , 
 I am going to see his Ghost .
 It will be his Ghostnot him .
 MrLorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm .
 There , there , there .
 See now , see now .
 The best and the worst are known to you , now .
 You are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman , and , with a fair sea voyage , and a fair land journey , you will be soon at his dear side .
 She repeated in the same tone , sunk to a whisper , I have been free , I have been happy , yet his Ghost has never haunted me .
 Perfectly still and silent , and not even fallen back in her chair , she sat under his hand , utterly insensible .
 with her eyes open and fixed upon him , and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or branded into her forehead .
 So close was her hold upon his arm , that he feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her .
 therefore he called out loudly for assistance without moving .
 I really think this must be a man .
 was MrLorry's breathless reflection , simultaneously with his coming against the wall .
 Why , look at you all .
 bawled this figure , addressing the inn servants .
 Why don't you go and fetch things , instead of standing there staring at me .
 I am not so much to look at , am I .
 Why don't you go and fetch things .
 I'll let you know , if you don't bring smelling-salts , cold water , and vinegar , quick , I will .
 I hope she will do well now , said MrLorry .
 No thanks to you in brown , if she does .
 My darling pretty .
 I hope , said MrLorry , after another pause of feeble sympathy and humility , that you accompany Miss Manette to France .
 A likely thing , too .
 replied the strong woman .
 If it was ever intended that I should go across salt water , do you suppose Providence would have cast my lot in an island .
 This being another question hard to answer , MrJarvis Lorry withdrew to consider it .
 A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken , in the street .
 The accident had happened in getting it out of a cart .
 the cask had tumbled out with a run , the hoops had burst , and it lay on the stones just outside the door of the wine-shop , shattered like a walnut-shell .
 The wine was red wine , and had stained the ground of the narrow street in the suburb of Saint Antoine , in Paris , where it was spilled .
 It had stained many hands , too , and many faces , and many naked feet , and many wooden shoes .
 The hands of the man who sawed the wood , left red marks on the billets .
 and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby , was stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again .
 Those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask , had acquired a tigerish smear about the mouth .
 and one tall joker so besmirched , his head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it , scrawled upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine-leesBLOOD .
 The time was to come , when that wine too would be spilled on the street-stones , and when the stain of it would be red upon many there .
 The fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance , as is often the way with his tribe .
 It missed its mark , and completely failed , as is often the way with his tribe too .
 What now .
 Are you a subject for the mad hospital .
 said the wine-shop keeper , crossing the road , and obliterating the jest with a handful of mud , picked up for the purpose , and smeared over it .
 Why do you write in the public streets .
 Is theretell me thouis there no other place to write such words in .
 In his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand perhaps accidentally , perhaps not upon the joker's heart .
 The joker rapped it with his own , took a nimble spring upward , and came down in a fantastic dancing attitude , with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his hand , and held out .
 A joker of an extremely , not to say wolfishly practical character , he looked , under those circumstances .
 The wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about , until they rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady , who were seated in a corner .
 Other company were there : two playing cards , two playing dominoes , three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply of wine .
 As he passed behind the counter , he took notice that the elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady , This is our man .
 What the devil YOU do in that galley there .
 said Monsieur Defarge to himself .
 I don't know you .
 But , he feigned not to notice the two strangers , and fell into discourse with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter .
 How goes it , Jacques .
 said one of these three to Monsieur Defarge .
 Is all the spilt wine swallowed .
 Every drop , Jacques , answered Monsieur Defarge .
 When this interchange of Christian name was effected , Madame Defarge , picking her teeth with her toothpick , coughed another grain of cough , and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line .
 It is not often , said the second of the three , addressing Monsieur Defarge , that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine , or of anything but black bread and death .
 Is it not so , Jacques .
 It is so , Jacques , Monsieur Defarge returned .
 At this second interchange of the Christian name , Madame Defarge , still using her toothpick with profound composure , coughed another grain of cough , and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line .
 Ah .
 So much the worse .
 A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle always have in their mouths , and hard lives they live , Jacques .
 Am I right , Jacques .
 You are right , Jacques , was the response of Monsieur Defarge .
 This third interchange of the Christian name was completed at the moment when Madame Defarge put her toothpick by , kept her eyebrows up , and slightly rustled in her seat .
 The three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge , with three flourishes .
 She acknowledged their homage by bending her head , and giving them a quick look .
 Then she glanced in a casual manner round the wine-shop , took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose of spirit , and became absorbed in it .
 Gentlemen , said her husband , who had kept his bright eye observantly upon her , good day .
 The chamber , furnished bachelor-fashion , that you wished to see , and were inquiring for when I stepped out , is on the fifth floor .
 The doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard close to the left here , pointing with his hand , near to the window of my establishment .
 But , now that I remember , one of you has already been there , and can show the way .
 Gentlemen , adieu .
 They paid for their wine , and left the place .
 The eyes of Monsieur Defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly gentleman advanced from his corner , and begged the favour of a word .
 Willingly , sir , said Monsieur Defarge , and quietly stepped with him to the door .
 Their conference was very short , but very decided .
 Almost at the first word , Monsieur Defarge started and became deeply attentive .
 It had not lasted a minute , when he nodded and went out .
 The gentleman then beckoned to the young lady , and they , too , went out .
 Madame Defarge knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows , and saw nothing .
 MrJarvis Lorry and Miss Manette , emerging from the wine-shop thus , joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own company just before .
 It opened from a stinking little black courtyard , and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses , inhabited by a great number of people .
 In the gloomy tile-paved entry to the gloomy tile-paved staircase , Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee to the child of his old master , and put her hand to his lips .
 It was a gentle action , but not at all gently done .
 a very remarkable transformation had come over him in a few seconds .
 He had no good-humour in his face , nor any openness of aspect left , but had become a secret , angry , dangerous man .
 Is he alone .
 the latter whispered .
 Alone .
 God help him , who should be with him .
 said the other , in the same low voice .
 Is he always alone , then .
 Yes .
 Of his own desire .
 Of his own necessity .
 As he was , when I first saw him after they found me and demanded to know if I would take him , and , at my peril be discreetas he was then , so he is now .
 He is greatly changed .
 Changed .
 The keeper of the wine-shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand , and mutter a tremendous curse .
 No direct answer could have been half so forcible .
 MrLorry's spirits grew heavier and heavier , as he and his two companions ascended higher and higher .
 Such a staircase , with its accessories , in the older and more crowded parts of Paris , would be bad enough now .
 but , at that time , it was vile indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses .
 Every little habitation within the great foul nest of one high buildingthat is to say , the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general staircaseleft its own heap of refuse on its own landing , besides flinging other refuse from its own windows .
 The uncontrollable and hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered , would have polluted the air , even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their intangible impurities .
 the two bad sources combined made it almost insupportable .
 Through such an atmosphere , by a steep dark shaft of dirt and poison , the way lay .
 Yielding to his own disturbance of mind , and to his young companion's agitation , which became greater every instant , MrJarvis Lorry twice stopped to rest .
 Each of these stoppages was made at a doleful grating , by which any languishing good airs that were left uncorrupted , seemed to escape , and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed to crawl in .
 Through the rusted bars , tastes , rather than glimpses , were caught of the jumbled neighbourhood .
 and nothing within range , nearer or lower than the summits of the two great towers of Notre-Dame , had any promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations .
 The door is locked then , my friend .
 said MrLorry , surprised .
 You think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired .
 Why .
 Because he has lived so long , locked up , that he would be frightenedravetear himself to piecesdiecome to I know not what harmif his door was left open .
 Is it possible .
 exclaimed MrLorry .
 Courage , dear miss .
 Courage .
 Business .
 The worst will be over in a moment .
 it is but passing the room-door , and the worst is over .
 Then , all the good you bring to him , all the relief , all the happiness you bring to him , begin .
 Let our good friend here , assist you on that side .
 That's well , friend Defarge .
 Come , now .
 Business , business .
 I forgot them in the surprise of your visit , explained Monsieur Defarge .
 Leave us , good boys .
 we have business here .
 The three glided by , and went silently down .
 There appearing to be no other door on that floor , and the keeper of the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone , MrLorry asked him in a whisper , with a little anger : 
.
 Do you make a show of Monsieur Manette .
 I show him , in the way you have seen , to a chosen few .
 Is that well .
 I think it is well .
 Who are the few .
 How do you choose them .
 With an admonitory gesture to keep them back , he stooped , and looked in through the crevice in the wall .
 Soon raising his head again , he struck twice or thrice upon the doorevidently with no other object than to make a noise there .
 With the same intention , he drew the key across it , three or four times , before he put it clumsily into the lock , and turned it as heavily as he could .
 The door slowly opened inward under his hand , and he looked into the room and said something .
 A faint voice answered something .
 Little more than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side .
 A-a-a-business , business .
 he urged , with a moisture that was not of business shining on his cheek .
 Come in , come in .
 I am afraid of it , she answered , shuddering .
 Of it .
 What .
 I mean of him .
 Of my father .
 Rendered in a manner desperate , by her state and by the beckoning of their conductor , he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his shoulder , lifted her a little , and hurried her into the room .
 He sat her down just within the door , and held her , clinging to him .
 Defarge drew out the key , closed the door , locked it on the inside , took out the key again , and held it in his hand .
 All this he did , methodically , and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he could make .
 Finally , he walked across the room with a measured tread to where the window was .
 He stopped there , and faced round .
 Good day .
 said Monsieur Defarge , looking down at the white head that bent low over the shoemaking .
 It was raised for a moment , and a very faint voice responded to the salutation , as if it were at a distance : 
 Good day .
 You are still hard at work , I see .
 The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful .
 It was not the faintness of physical weakness , though confinement and hard fare no doubt had their part in it .
 Its deplorable peculiarity was , that it was the faintness of solitude and disuse .
 It was like the last feeble echo of a sound made long and long ago .
 So entirely had it lost the life and resonance of the human voice , that it affected the senses like a once beautiful color faded away into a poor weak stain .
 So sunken and suppressed it was , that it was like a voice underground .
 So expressive it was , of a hopeless and lost creature , that a famished traveler , wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness , would have remembered home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die .
 I want , said Defarge , who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker , to let in a little more light here .
 You can bear a little more .
 What did you say .
 You can bear a little more light .
 The opened half-door was opened a little further , and secured at that angle for the time .
 A broad ray of light fell into the garret , and showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap , pausing in his labour .
 His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his feet and on his bench .
 He had a white beard , raggedly cut , but not very long , a hollow face , and exceedingly bright eyes .
 The hollowness and thinness of his face would have caused them to look large , under his yet dark eyebrows and his confused white hair , though they had been really otherwise .
 but , they were naturally large , and looked unnaturally so .
 His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat , and showed his body to be withered and worn .
 He , and his old canvas frock , and his loose stockings , and all his poor tatters of clothes , had , in a long seclusion from direct light and air , faded down to such a dull uniformity of parchment-yellow , that it would have been hard to say which was which .
 He had put up a hand between his eyes and the light , and the very bones of it seemed transparent .
 So he sat , with a steadfastly vacant gaze , pausing in his work .
 He never looked at the figure before him , without first looking down on this side of himself , then on that , as if he had lost the habit of associating place with sound .
 he never spoke , without first wandering in this manner , and forgetting to speak .
 Are you going to finish that pair of shoes to-day .
 asked Defarge , motioning to MrLorry to come forward .
 What did you say .
 Do you mean to finish that pair of shoes to-day .
 I can't say that I mean to .
 I suppose so .
 I don't know .
 But , the question reminded him of his work , and he bent over it again .
 You have a visitor , you see , said Monsieur Defarge .
 What did you say .
 Here is a visitor .
 The shoemaker looked up as before , but without removing a hand from his work .
 Come .
 said Defarge .
 Here is monsieur , who knows a well-made shoe when he sees one .
 Show him that shoe you are working at .
 Take it , monsieur .
 MrLorry took it in his hand .
 Tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is , and the maker's name .
 There was a longer pause than usual , before the shoemaker replied : 
 I forget what it was you asked me .
 What did you say .
 I said , couldn't you describe the kind of shoe , for monsieur's information .
 And the maker's name .
 said Defarge .
 Did you ask me for my name .
 Assuredly I did .
 One Hundred and Five , North Tower .
 Is that all .
 One Hundred and Five , North Tower .
 With a weary sound that was not a sigh , nor a groan , he bent to work again , until the silence was again broken .
 You are not a shoemaker by trade .
 said MrLorry , looking steadfastly at him .
 I am not a shoemaker by trade .
 No , I was not a shoemaker by trade .
 I-I learnt it here .
 I taught myself .
 I asked leave to .
 He lapsed away , even for minutes , ringing those measured changes on his hands the whole time .
 His eyes came slowly back , at last , to the face from which they had wandered .
 when they rested on it , he started , and resumed , in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake , reverting to a subject of last night .
 The shoe dropped to the ground , and he sat looking fixedly at the questioner .
 Darkness had fatten on him in its place .
 He looked at the two , less and less attentively , and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground and looked about him in the old way .
 Finally , with a deep long sigh , he took the shoe up , and resumed his work .
 Have you recognised him , monsieur .
 asked Defarge in a whisper .
 She had moved from the wall of the garret , very near to the bench on which he sat .
 There was something awful in his unconsciousness of the figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped over his labour .
 It happened , at length , that he had occasion to change the instrument in his hand , for his shoemaker's knife .
 It lay on that side of him which was not the side on which she stood .
 He had taken it up , and was stooping to work again , when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress .
 He raised them , and saw her face .
 The two spectators started forward , but she stayed them with a motion of her hand .
 She had no fear of his striking at her with the knife , though they had .
 What is this .
 With the tears streaming down her face , she put her two hands to her lips , and kissed them to him .
 then clasped them on her breast , as if she laid his ruined head there .
 You are not the gaoler's daughter .
 She sighed No .
 Who are you .
 Not yet trusting the tones of her voice , she sat down on the bench beside him .
 He recoiled , but she laid her hand upon his arm .
 A strange thrill struck him when she did so , and visibly passed over his frame .
 he laid the knife down' softly , as he sat staring at her .
 Her golden hair , which she wore in long curls , had been hurriedly pushed aside , and fell down over her neck .
  Look well upon that gentleman , my learned friend there , pointing to him who had tossed the paper over , and then look well upon the prisoner .
 How say you .
 Are they very like each other .
 Yet , this MrCarton took in more of the details of the scene than he appeared to take in .
 for now , when Miss Manette's head dropped upon her father's breast , he was the first to see it , and to say audibly : Officer .
 look to that young lady .
 Help the gentleman to take her out .
 Don't you see she will fall .
 There was much commiseration for her as she was removed , and much sympathy with her father .
 It had evidently been a great distress to him , to have the days of his imprisonment recalled .
 He had shown strong internal agitation when he was questioned , and that pondering or brooding look which made him old , had been upon him , like a heavy cloud , ever since .
 As he passed out , the jury , who had turned back and paused a moment , spoke , through their foreman .
 Jerry , if you wish to take something to eat , you can .
 But , keep in the way .
 You will be sure to hear when the jury come in .
 Don't be a moment behind them , for I want you to take the verdict back to the bank .
 You are the quickest messenger I know , and will get to Temple Bar long before I can .
 Jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle , and he knuckled it in acknowledgment of this communication and a shilling .
 MrCarton came up at the moment , and touched MrLorry on the arm .
 How is the young lady .
 She is greatly distressed .
 but her father is comforting her , and she feels the better for being out of court .
 I'll tell the prisoner so .
 It won't do for a respectable bank gentleman like you , to be seen speaking to him publicly , you know .
 The prisoner came forward directly .
 You will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness , Miss Manette .
 She will do very well .
 You have seen the worst of her agitation .
 I am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it .
 Could you tell her so for me , with my fervent acknowledgments .
 MrCarton's manner was so careless as to be almost insolent .
 He stood , half turned from the prisoner , lounging with his elbow against the bar .
 I do ask it .
 Accept my cordial thanks .
 The worst .
 It's the wisest thing to expect , and the likeliest .
 But I think their withdrawing is in your favour .
 MrLorry was already calling at the door when he got there .
 Here , sir .
 It's a fight to get back again .
 Here I am , sir .
 MrLorry handed him a paper through the throng .
 Quick .
 Have you got it .
 Yes , sir .
 Hastily written on the paper was the word ACQUITTED .
 If you had sent the message , Recalled to Life , ' again , muttered Jerry , as he turned , I should have known what you meant , this time .
 He had no opportunity of saying , or so much as thinking , anything else , until he was clear of the Old Bailey .
 for , the crowd came pouring out with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs , and a loud buzz swept into the street as if the baffled blue-flies were dispersing in search of other carrion .
 Only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from his mind .
 She was the golden thread that united him to a Past beyond his misery , and to a Present beyond his misery : and the sound of her voice , the light of her face , the touch of her hand , had a strong beneficial influence with him almost always .
 Not absolutely always , for she could recall some occasions on which her power had failed .
 but they were few and slight , and she believed them over .
 He still had his wig and gown on , and he said , squaring himself at his late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent MrLorry clean out of the group : I am glad to have brought you off with honour , MrDarnay .
 It was an infamous prosecution , grossly infamous .
 but not the less likely to succeed on that account .
 You have laid me under an obligation to you for lifein two senses , said his late client , taking his hand .
 You think so .
 said MrStryver .
 Well .
 you have been present all day , and you ought to know .
 You are a man of business , too .
 Speak for yourself , MrLorry , said Stryver .
 I have a night's work to do yet .
 Speak for yourself .
 He slowly shook the shadow off , and turned to her .
 Shall we go home , my father .
 With a long breath , he answered Yes .
 Nobody had made any acknowledgment of MrCarton's part in the day's proceedings .
 nobody had known of it .
 He was unrobed , and was none the better for it in appearance .
 If you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind , when the business mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business appearances , you would be amused , MrDarnay .
 MrLorry reddened , and said , warmly , You have mentioned that before , sir .
 We men of business , who serve a House , are not our own masters .
 We have to think of the House more than ourselves .
 Business .
 Bless you , I have no business , said MrCarton .
 It is a pity you have not , sir .
 I think so , too .
 If you had , pursued MrLorry , perhaps you would attend to it .
 Perhaps a little angry with himself , as well as with the barrister , MrLorry bustled into the chair , and was carried off to Tellson's .
 Carton , who smelt of port wine , and did not appear to be quite sober , laughed then , and turned to Darnay : 
 This is a strange chance that throws you and me together .
 This must be a strange night to you , standing alone here with your counterpart on these street stones .
 I hardly seem yet , returned Charles Darnay , to belong to this world again .
 I don't wonder at it .
 it's not so long since you were pretty far advanced on your way to another .
 You speak faintly .
 I begin to think I AM faint .
 Then why the devil don't you dine .
 I dined , myself , while those numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong tothis , or some other .
 Let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at .
 Do you feel , yet , that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again , MrDarnay .
 It must be an immense satisfaction .
 He said it bitterly , and filled up his glass again : which was a large one .
 Confused by the emotion of the day , and feeling his being there with this Double of coarse deportment , to be like a dream , Charles Darnay was at a loss how to answer .
 finally , answered not at all .
 Miss Manette , then .
 Miss Manette , then .
 Looking his companion full in the face while he drank the toast , Carton flung his glass over his shoulder against the wall , where it shivered to pieces .
 then , rang the bell , and ordered in another .
 That's a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark , MrDarnay .
 he said , ruing his new goblet .
 A slight frown and a laconic Yes , were the answer .
 Again Darnay answered not a word .
 She was mightily pleased to have your message , when I gave it her .
 Not that she showed she was pleased , but I suppose she was .
 The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this disagreeable companion had , of his own free will , assisted him in the strait of the day .
 He turned the dialogue to that point , and thanked him for it .
 I neither want any thanks , nor merit any , was the careless rejoinder .
 It was nothing to do , in the first place .
 and I don't know why I did it , in the second .
 MrDarnay , let me ask you a question .
 Do you think I particularly like you .
 Really , MrCarton , returned the other , oddly disconcerted , I have not asked myself the question .
 But ask yourself the question now .
 I don't think I do , said Carton .
 I begin to have a very good opinion of your understanding .
 Carton rejoining , Nothing in life .
 Darnay rang .
 Do you call the whole reckoning .
 said Carton .
 On his answering in the affirmative , Then bring me another pint of this same wine , drawer , and come and wake me at ten .
 I think you have been drinking , MrCarton .
 Think .
 You know I have been drinking .
 Since I must say so , I know it .
 Then you shall likewise know why .
 I am a disappointed drudge , sir .
 I care for no man on earth , and no man on earth cares for me .
 Much to be regretted .
 You might have used your talents better .
 May be so , MrDarnay .
 may be not .
 Don't let your sober face elate you , however .
 you don't know what it may come to .
 Good night .
 A favourite at the Old Bailey , and eke at the Sessions , MrStryver had begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on which he mounted .
 Sessions and Old Bailey had now to summon their favourite , specially , to their longing arms .
 and shouldering itself towards the visage of the Lord Chief Justice in the Court of King's Bench , the florid countenance of MrStryver might be daily seen , bursting out of the bed of wigs , like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from among a rank garden-full of flaring companions .
 It had once been noted at the Bar , that while MrStryver was a glib man , and an unscrupulous , and a ready , and a bold , he had not that faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements , which is among the most striking and necessary of the advocate's accomplishments .
 But , a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this .
 The more business he got , the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its pith and marrow .
 and however late at night he sat carousing with Sydney Carton , he always had his points at his fingers' ends in the morning .
 Ten o'clock , sir .
 What do you mean .
 Ten o'clock at night .
 Yes , sir .
 Your honour told me to call you .
 Oh .
 I remember .
 Very well , very well .
 You are a little late , Memory , said Stryver .
 About the usual time .
 it may be a quarter of an hour later .
 They went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with papers , where there was a blazing fire .
 A kettle steamed upon the hob , and in the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone , with plenty of wine upon it , and brandy , and rum , and sugar , and lemons .
 You have had your bottle , I perceive , Sydney .
 I thought he was rather a handsome fellow , and I thought I should have been much the same sort of fellow , if I had had any luck .
 MrStryver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch .
 You and your luck , Sydney .
 Get to work , get to work .
 Not much boiling down to be done to-night , Memory , said MrStryver , gaily , as he looked among his papers .
 How much .
 Only two sets of them .
 Give me the worst first .
 There they are , Sydney .
 Fire away .
 And now we have done , Sydney , fill a bumper of punch , said MrStryver .
 With a deprecatory grunt , the jackal again complied .
 And why not .
 God knows .
 It was my way , I suppose .
 He sat , with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before him , looking at the fire .
 Oh , botheration .
 returned Sydney , with a lighter and more good-humoured laugh , don't YOU be moral .
 Partly through paying me to help you , I suppose .
 But it's not worth your while to apostrophise me , or the air , about it .
 what you want to do , you do .
 You were always in the front rank , and I was always behind .
 I had to get into the front rank .
 I was not born there , was I .
 Before Shrewsbury , and at Shrewsbury , and ever since Shrewsbury , pursued Carton , you have fallen into your rank , and I have fallen into mine .
 Even when we were fellow-students in the Student-Quarter of Paris , picking up French , and French law , and other French crumbs that we didn't get much good of , you were always somewhere , and I was always nowhere .
 And whose fault was that .
 Well then .
 Pledge me to the pretty witness , said Stryver , holding up his glass .
 Are you turned in a pleasant direction .
 Apparently not , for he became gloomy again .
 Pretty witness , he muttered , looking down into his glass .
 I have had enough of witnesses to-day and to-night .
 who's your pretty witness .
 The picturesque doctor's daughter , Miss Manette .
 Is she not .
 No .
 Why , man alive , she was the admiration of the whole Court .
 Rot the admiration of the whole Court .
 Who made the Old Bailey a judge of beauty .
 She was a golden-haired doll .
 Quick to see what happened .
 If a girl , doll or no doll , swoons within a yard or two of a man's nose , he can see it without a perspective-glass .
 I pledge you , but I deny the beauty .
 And now I'll have no more drink .
 I'll get to bed .
 On this certain fine Sunday , MrLorry walked towards Soho , early in the afternoon , for three reasons of habit .
 Firstly , because , on fine Sundays , he often walked out , before dinner , with the Doctor and Lucie .
 secondly , because , on unfavourable Sundays , he was accustomed to be with them as the family friend , talking , reading , looking out of window , and generally getting through the day .
 thirdly , because he happened to have his own little shrewd doubts to solve , and knew how the ways of the Doctor's household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving them .
 Expected home .
 Miss Lucie at home .
 Expected home .
 Miss Pross at home .
 Possibly at home , but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to anticipate intentions of Miss Pross , as to admission or denial of the fact .
 As I am at home myself , said MrLorry , I'll go upstairs .
 I wonder , said MrLorry , pausing in his looking about , that he keeps that reminder of his sufferings about him .
 And why wonder at that .
 was the abrupt inquiry that made him start .
 I should have thought MrLorry began .
 I am pretty well , I thank you , answered MrLorry , with meekness .
 how are you .
 Nothing to boast of , said Miss Pross .
 Indeed .
 Ah .
 indeed .
 said Miss Pross .
 I am very much put out about my Ladybird .
 Indeed .
 Really , then .
 said MrLorry , as an amendment .
 Really , is bad enough , returned Miss Pross , but better .
 Yes , I am very much put out .
 May I ask the cause .
 I don't want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of Ladybird , to come here looking after her , said Miss Pross .
 DO dozens come for that purpose .
 Hundreds , said Miss Pross .
 It was characteristic of this lady as of some other people before her time and since that whenever her original proposition was questioned , she exaggerated it .
 I have lived with the darlingor the darling has lived with me , and paid me for it .
 which she certainly should never have done , you may take your affidavit , if I could have afforded to keep either myself or her for nothing--since she was ten years old .
 And it's really very hard , said Miss Pross .
 Not seeing with precision what was very hard , MrLorry shook his head .
 using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would fit anything .
 All sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet , are always turning up , said Miss Pross .
 When you began it .
 I began it , Miss Pross .
 Didn't you .
 Who brought her father to life .
 Oh .
 If THAT was beginning it said MrLorry .
 There never was , nor will be , but one man worthy of Ladybird , said Miss Pross .
 and that was my brother Solomon , if he hadn't made a mistake in life .
 Never .
 And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him .
 Do you believe that he thinks of it much .
 I do , said Miss Pross .
 Do you imagine MrLorry had begun , when Miss Pross took him up short with : 
 Never imagine anything .
 Have no imagination at all .
 I stand corrected .
 do you supposeyou go so far as to suppose , sometimes .
 Now and then , said Miss Pross .
 I don't suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me .
 And that is .
 That she thinks he has .
 Dull .
 Miss Pross inquired , with placidity .
 Well .
 To the best of my understanding , and bad's the best , you'll tell me , said Miss Pross , softened by the tone of the apology , he is afraid of the whole subject .
 Afraid .
 It's plain enough , I should think , why he may be .
 It's a dreadful remembrance .
 Besides that , his loss of himself grew out of it .
 Not knowing how he lost himself , or how he recovered himself , he may never feel certain of not losing himself again .
 That alone wouldn't make the subject pleasant , I should think .
 The corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes .
 it had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet , that it seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had set it going .
 Here they are .
 said Miss Pross , rising to break up the conference .
 and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon .
 On Sundays , Miss Pross dined at the Doctor's table , but on other days persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods , either in the lower regions , or in her own room on the second floora blue chamber , to which no one but her Ladybird ever gained admittance .
 On this occasion , Miss Pross , responding to Ladybird's pleasant face and pleasant efforts to please her , unbent exceedingly .
 so the dinner was very pleasant , too .
 It was an oppressive day , and , after dinner , Lucie proposed that the wine should be carried out under the plane-tree , and they should sit there in the air .
 As everything turned upon her , and revolved about her , they went out under the plane-tree , and she carried the wine down for the special benefit of MrLorry .
 She had installed herself , some time before , as MrLorry's cup-bearer .
 and while they sat under the plane-tree , talking , she kept his glass replenished .
 Mysterious backs and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked , and the plane-tree whispered to them in its own way above their heads .
 Still , the Hundreds of people did not present themselves .
 MrDarnay presented himself while they were sitting under the plane-tree , but he was only One .
 I have been there , as you remember , said Darnay , with a smile , though reddening a little angrily , in another character , and not in a character that gives facilities for seeing much of it .
 They told me a curious thing when I was there .
 What was that .
 Lucie asked .
 Tea-time , and Miss Pross making tea , with another fit of the jerks upon her , and yet no Hundreds of people .
 MrCarton had lounged in , but he made only Two .
 It comes surely , said Carton .
 There was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to get shelter before the storm broke .
 the wonderful corner for echoes resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going , yet not a footstep was there .
 A multitude of people , and yet a solitude .
 said Darnay , when they had listened for a while .
 Is it not impressive , MrDarnay .
 asked Lucie .
 Sometimes , I have sat here of an evening , until I have fanciedbut even the shade of a foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night , when all is so black and solemn .
 Let us shudder too .
 We may know what it is .
 It will seem nothing to you .
 Such whims are only impressive as we originate them , I think .
 they are not to be communicated .
 I have sometimes sat alone here of an evening , listening , until I have made the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming by-and-bye into our lives .
 There is a great crowd coming one day into our lives , if that be so , Sydney Carton struck in , in his moody way .
 The footsteps were incessant , and the hurry of them became more and more rapid .
 The corner echoed and re-echoed with the tread of feet .
 some , as it seemed , under the windows .
 some , as it seemed , in the room .
 some coming , some going , some breaking off , some stopping altogether .
 all in the distant streets , and not one within sight .
 I take them into mine .
 said Carton .
 I ask no questions and make no stipulations .
 There is a great crowd bearing down upon us , Miss Manette , and I see themby the Lightning .
 He added the last words , after there had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window .
 And I hear them .
 he added again , after a peal of thunder .
 Here they come , fast , fierce , and furious .
 It was the rush and roar of rain that he typified , and it stopped him , for no voice could be heard in it .
 A memorable storm of thunder and lightning broke with that sweep of water , and there was not a moment's interval in crash , and fire , and rain , until after the moon rose at midnight .
 Good night , MrCarton , said the man of business .
 Good night , MrDarnay .
 Shall we ever see such a night again , together .
 Perhaps .
 Perhaps , see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar , bearing down upon them , too .
 Monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business , which was , to let everything go on in its own way .
 of particular public business , Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go his waytend to his own power and pocket .
 Of his pleasures , general and particular , Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea , that the world was made for them .
 The text of his order altered from the original by only a pronoun , which is not much ran : The earth and the fulness thereof are mine , saith Monseigneur .
 A sumptuous man was the Farmer-General .
 Thirty horses stood in his stables , twenty-four male domestics sat in his halls , six body-women waited on his wife .
 As one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and forage where he could , the Farmer-Generalhowsoever his matrimonial relations conduced to social moralitywas at least the greatest reality among the personages who attended at the hotel of Monseigneur that day .
 Exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding , which was at that remarkable timeand has been sinceto be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural subject of human interest , were in the most exemplary state of exhaustion , at the hotel of Monseigneur .
 Such homes had these various notabilities left behind them in the fine world of Paris , that the spies among the assembled devotees of Monseigneurforming a goodly half of the polite companywould have found it hard to discover among the angels of that sphere one solitary wife , who , in her manners and appearance , owned to being a Mother .
 Indeed , except for the mere act of bringing a troublesome creature into this worldwhich does not go far towards the realisation of the name of motherthere was no such thing known to the fashion .
 Peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close , and brought them up , and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and supped as at twenty .
 Monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his chocolate , caused the doors of the Holiest of Holiests to be thrown open , and issued forth .
 Then , what submission , what cringing and fawning , what servility , what abject humiliation .
 As to bowing down in body and spirit , nothing in that way was left for Heavenwhich may have been one among other reasons why the worshippers of Monseigneur never troubled it .
 With that , he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the dust from his feet , and quietly walked downstairs .
 Its owner went downstairs into the courtyard , got into his carriage , and drove away .
 Not many people had talked with him at the reception .
 he had stood in a little space apart , and Monseigneur might have been warmer in his manner .
 It appeared , under the circumstances , rather agreeable to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses , and often barely escaping from being run down .
 His man drove as if he were charging an enemy , and the furious recklessness of the man brought no check into the face , or to the lips , of the master .
 The complaint had sometimes made itself audible , even in that deaf city and dumb age , that , in the narrow streets without footways , the fierce patrician custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a barbarous manner .
 But , few cared enough for that to think of it a second time , and , in this matter , as in all others , the common wretches were left to get out of their difficulties as they could .
 Why does he make that abominable noise .
 Is it his child .
 The fountain was a little removed .
 for the street opened , where it was , into a space some ten or twelve yards square .
 As the tall man suddenly got up from the ground , and came running at the carriage , Monsieur the Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt .
 Killed .
 shrieked the man , in wild desperation , extending both arms at their length above his head , and staring at him .
 Dead .
 He took out his purse .
 It is extraordinary to me , said he , that you people cannot take care of yourselves and your children .
 One or the other of you is for ever in the way .
 How do I know what injury you have done my horses .
 See .
 Give him that .
 He threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up , and all the heads craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell .
 The tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry , Dead .
 He was arrested by the quick arrival of another man , for whom the rest made way .
 On seeing him , the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder , sobbing and crying , and pointing to the fountain , where some women were stooping over the motionless bundle , and moving gently about it .
 They were as silent , however , as the men .
 I know all , I know all , said the last comer .
 Be a brave man , my Gaspard .
 It is better for the poor little plaything to die so , than to live .
 It has died in a moment without pain .
 Could it have lived an hour as happily .
 You are a philosopher , you there , said the Marquis , smiling .
 How do they call you .
 They call me Defarge .
 Of what trade .
 Monsieur the Marquis , vendor of wine .
 Pick up that , philosopher and vendor of wine , said the Marquis , throwing him another gold coin , and spend it as you will .
 The horses there .
 are they right .
 Hold .
 said Monsieur the Marquis .
 Hold the horses .
 Who threw that .
 So cowed was their condition , and so long and hard their experience of what such a man could do to them , within the law and beyond it , that not a voice , or a hand , or even an eye was raised .
 Among the men , not one .
 But the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily , and looked the Marquis in the face .
 It was not for his dignity to notice it .
 his contemptuous eyes passed over her , and over all the other rats .
 and he leaned back in his seat again , and gave the word Go on .
 Monsieur the Marquis in his travelling carriage which might have been lighter , conducted by four post-horses and two postilions , fagged up a steep hill .
 A blush on the countenance of Monsieur the Marquis was no impeachment of his high breeding .
 it was not from within .
 it was occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his controlthe setting sun .
 The sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it gained the hill-top , that its occupant was steeped in crimson .
 It will die out , said Monsieur the Marquis , glancing at his hands , directly .
 Bring me hither that fellow .
 said the Marquis to the courier .
 I passed you on the road .
 Monseigneur , it is true .
 I had the honour of being passed on the road .
 Monseigneur , it is true .
 What did you look at , so fixedly .
 Monseigneur , I looked at the man .
 He stooped a little , and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the carriage .
 All his fellows stooped to look under the carriage .
 What man , pig .
 And why look there .
 Who .
 demanded the traveller .
 Monseigneur , the man .
 May the Devil carry away these idiots .
 How do you call the man .
 You know all the men of this part of the country .
 Who was he .
 Your clemency , Monseigneur .
 He was not of this part of the country .
 Of all the days of my life , I never saw him .
 Swinging by the chain .
 To be suffocated .
 What was he like .
 Truly , you did well , said the Marquis , felicitously sensible that such vermin were not to ruffle him , to see a thief accompanying my carriage , and not open that great mouth of yours .
 Bah .
 Put him aside , Monsieur Gabelle .
 Bah .
 Go aside .
 said Monsieur Gabelle .
 Monseigneur , I am flattered to devote myself to your orders .
 Did he run away , fellow .
 where is that Accursed .
 Did the man run away , Dolt , when we stopped for the drag .
 Monseigneur , he precipitated himself over the hill-side , head first , as a person plunges into the river .
 See to it , Gabelle .
 Go on .
 The half-dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the wheels , like sheep .
 the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky to save their skins and bones .
 they had very little else to save , or they might not have been so fortunate .
 To this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been growing worse , and was not at its worst , a woman was kneeling .
 She turned her head as the carriage came up to her , rose quickly , and presented herself at the carriage-door .
 It is you , Monseigneur .
 Monseigneur , a petition .
 How , then .
 What is it .
 Always petitions .
 What of your husband , the forester .
 Always the same with you people .
 He cannot pay something .
 He has paid all , Monseigneur .
 He is dead .
 Well .
 He is quiet .
 Can I restore him to you .
 Alas , no , Monseigneur .
 But he lies yonder , under a little heap of poor grass .
 Again , well .
 She looked an old woman , but was young .
 Her manner was one of passionate grief .
 by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together with wild energy , and laid one of them on the carriage-doortenderly , caressingly , as if it had been a human breast , and could be expected to feel the appealing touch .
 Monseigneur , hear me .
 Monseigneur , hear my petition .
 My husband died of want .
 so many die of want .
 so many more will die of want .
 Again , well .
 Can I feed them .
 The shadow of a large high-roofed house , and of many over-hanging trees , was upon Monsieur the Marquis by that time .
 and the shadow was exchanged for the light of a flambeau , as his carriage stopped , and the great door of his chateau was opened to him .
 Monseigneur , not yet .
 It is not probable he will arrive to-night .
 nevertheless , leave the table as it is .
 I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour .
 What is that .
 he calmly asked , looking with attention at the horizontal lines of black and stone colour .
 Outside the blinds .
 Open the blinds .
 It was done .
 Monseigneur , it is nothing .
 The trees and the night are all that are here .
 Good , said the imperturbable master .
 Close them again .
 That was done too , and the Marquis went on with his supper .
 He was half way through it , when he again stopped with his glass in his hand , hearing the sound of wheels .
 It came on briskly , and came up to the front of the chateau .
 Ask who is arrived .
 It was the nephew of Monseigneur .
 He had been some few leagues behind Monseigneur , early in the afternoon .
 He had diminished the distance rapidly , but not so rapidly as to come up with Monseigneur on the road .
 He had heard of Monseigneur , at the posting-houses , as being before him .
 He was to be told said Monseigneur that supper awaited him then and there , and that he was prayed to come to it .
 In a little while he came .
 He had been known in England as Charles Darnay .
 Monseigneur received him in a courtly manner , but they did not shake hands .
 You left Paris yesterday , sir .
 he said to Monseigneur , as he took his seat at table .
 Yesterday .
 And you .
 I come direct .
 From London .
 You have been a long time coming , said the Marquis , with a smile .
 On the contrary .
 I come direct .
 Pardon me .
 I mean , not a long time on the journey .
 a long time intending the journey .
 I have been detained bythe nephew stopped a moment in his answervarious business .
 Without doubt , said the polished uncle .
 I have come back , sir , as you anticipate , pursuing the object that took me away .
 It carried me into great and unexpected peril .
 but it is a sacred object , and if it had carried me to death I hope it would have sustained me .
 Not to death , said the uncle .
 it is not necessary to say , to death .
 I doubt , sir , returned the nephew , whether , if it had carried me to the utmost brink of death , you would have cared to stop me there .
 The deepened marks in the nose , and the lengthening of the fine straight lines in the cruel face , looked ominous as to that .
 the uncle made a graceful gesture of protest , which was so clearly a slight form of good breeding that it was not reassuring .
 Indeed , sir , pursued the nephew , for anything I know , you may have expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious circumstances that surrounded me .
 No , no , no , said the uncle , pleasantly .
 Will you hear me .
 If it will do you any good , MrCarton , if it would make you happier , it would make me very glad .
 God bless you for your sweet compassion .
 He unshaded his face after a little while , and spoke steadily .
 Don't be afraid to hear me .
 Don't shrink from anything I say .
 I am like one who died young .
 All my life might have been .
 No , MrCarton .
 I am sure that the best part of it might still be .
 I am sure that you might be much , much worthier of yourself .
 She was pale and trembling .
 He came to her relief with a fixed despair of himself which made the interview unlike any other that could have been holden .
 Without it , can I not save you , MrCarton .
 Can I not recall youforgive me again .
 to a better course .
 Can I in no way repay your confidence .
 I know this is a confidence , she modestly said , after a little hesitation , and in earnest tears , I know you would say this to no one else .
 Can I turn it to no good account for yourself , MrCarton .
 He shook his head .
 Will nothing of it remain .
 O MrCarton , think again .
 Try again .
 Since it is my misfortune , MrCarton , to have made you more unhappy than you were before you knew me .
 Since the state of your mind that you describe , is , at all events , attributable to some influence of minethis is what I mean , if I can make it plaincan I use no influence to serve you .
 Have I no power for good , with you , at all .
 Which I entreated you to believe , again and again , most fervently , with all my heart , was capable of better things , MrCarton .
 Entreat me to believe it no more , Miss Manette .
 I have proved myself , and I know better .
 I distress you .
 I draw fast to an end .
 Will you let me believe , when I recall this day , that the last confidence of my life was reposed in your pure and innocent breast , and that it lies there alone , and will be shared by no one .
 If that will be a consolation to you , yes .
 Not even by the dearest one ever to be known to you .
 MrCarton , she answered , after an agitated pause , the secret is yours , not mine .
 and I promise to respect it .
 Thank you .
 And again , God bless you .
 He put her hand to his lips , and moved towards the door .
 I will , MrCarton .
 Hooroar , father .
 cried Young Jerry .
 The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious significance .
 The elder gentleman took the cry so ill , that he watched his opportunity , and smote the young gentleman on the ear .
 What d'ye mean .
 What are you hooroaring at .
 What do you want to conwey to your own father , you young Rip .
 This boy is a getting too many for ME .
 said MrCruncher , surveying him .
 Him and his hooroars .
 Don't let me hear no more of you , or you shall feel some more of me .
 D'ye hear .
 I warn't doing no harm , Young Jerry protested , rubbing his cheek .
 Drop it then , said MrCruncher .
 I won't have none of YOUR no harms .
 Get a top of that there seat , and look at the crowd .
 What is it , brother .
 What's it about .
 I don't know , said the man .
 Spies .
 Yaha .
 Tst .
 Spies .
 He asked another man .
 Who is it .
 Was He a spy .
 asked MrCruncher .
 Old Bailey spy , returned his informant .
 Yaha .
 Tst .
 Yah .
 Old Bailey Spiiies .
 Why , to be sure .
 exclaimed Jerry , recalling the Trial at which he had assisted .
 I've seen him .
 Dead , is he .
 Thus , with beer-drinking , pipe-smoking , song-roaring , and infinite caricaturing of woe , the disorderly procession went its way , recruiting at every step , and all the shops shutting up before it .
 Its destination was the old church of Saint Pancras , far off in the fields .
 It got there in course of time .
 insisted on pouring into the burial-ground .
 finally , accomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way , and highly to its own satisfaction .
 MrCruncher did not assist at the closing sports , but had remained behind in the churchyard , to confer and condole with the undertakers .
 The place had a soothing influence on him .
 He procured a pipe from a neighbouring public-house , and smoked it , looking in at the railings and maturely considering the spot .
 Young Jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest , and reported No job in his absence .
 The bank closed , the ancient clerks came out , the usual watch was set , and MrCruncher and his son went home to tea .
 The dejected MrsCruncher shook her head .
 Why , you're at it afore my face .
 said MrCruncher , with signs of angry apprehension .
 I am saying nothing .
 Yes , Jerry .
 MrCruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations , but made use of them , as people not unfrequently do , to express general ironical dissatisfaction .
 You are going out to-night .
 asked his decent wife , when he took another bite .
 Yes , I am .
 May I go with you , father .
 asked his son , briskly .
 No , you mayn't .
 I'm a goingas your mother knowsa fishing .
 That's where I'm going to .
 Going a fishing .
 Never you mind .
 Shall you bring any fish home , father .
 If I don't , you'll have short commons , to-morrow , returned that gentleman , shaking his head .
 that's questions enough for you .
 I ain't a going out , till you've been long abed .
 And mind you .
 said MrCruncher .
 No games to-morrow .
 If I , as a honest tradesman , succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two , none of your not touching of it , and sticking to bread .
 If I , as a honest tradesman , am able to provide a little beer , none of your declaring on water .
 When you go to Rome , do as Rome does .
 Rome will be a ugly customer to you , if you don't .
 I'm your Rome , you know .
 Then he began grumbling again : 
 I told you I would , said MrCruncher , and I did .
 Jerry , Jerry , Jerry .
 his wife implored .
 You oppose yourself to the profit of the business , said Jerry , and me and my partners suffer .
 You was to honour and obey .
 why the devil don't you .
 I try to be a good wife , Jerry , the poor woman protested , with tears .
 Is it being a good wife to oppose your husband's business .
 Is it honouring your husband to dishonour his business .
 Is it obeying your husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business .
 You hadn't taken to the dreadful business then , Jerry .
 The altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice , and terminated in the honest tradesman's kicking off his clay-soiled boots , and lying down at his length on the floor .
 After taking a timid peep at him lying on his back , with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow , his son lay down too , and fell asleep again .
 There was no fish for breakfast , and not much of anything else .
 MrCruncher was out of spirits , and out of temper , and kept an iron pot-lid by him as a projectile for the correction of MrsCruncher , in case he should observe any symptoms of her saying Grace .
 He was brushed and washed at the usual hour , and set off with his son to pursue his ostensible calling .
 I thought you knowed everything , father , said the artless boy .
 What's his goods , father .
 asked the brisk Young Jerry .
 His goods , said MrCruncher , after turning it over in his mind , is a branch of Scientific goods .
 Persons' bodies , ain't it , father .
 asked the lively boy .
 I believe it is something of that sort , said MrCruncher .
 Oh , father , I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when I'm quite growed up .
 There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge .
 As early as six o'clock in the morning , sallow faces peeping through its barred windows had descried other faces within , bending over measures of wine .
 Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best of times , but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that he sold at this time .
 A sour wine , moreover , or a souring , for its influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy .
 No vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur Defarge : but , a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark , lay hidden in the dregs of it .
 Good day , gentlemen .
 said Monsieur Defarge .
 It may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue .
 It elicited an answering chorus of Good day .
 It is bad weather , gentlemen , said Defarge , shaking his head .
 Upon which , every man looked at his neighbour , and then all cast down their eyes and sat silent .
 Except one man , who got up and went out .
 Have you finished your repast , friend .
 he asked , in due season .
 Yes , thank you .
 Come , then .
 You shall see the apartment that I told you you could occupy .
 It will suit you to a marvel .
 Defarge closed the door carefully , and spoke in a subdued voice : 
 Jacques One , Jacques Two , Jacques Three .
 This is the witness encountered by appointment , by me , Jacques Four .
 He will tell you all .
 Speak , Jacques Five .
 The mender of roads , blue cap in hand , wiped his swarthy forehead with it , and said , Where shall I commence , monsieur .
 Commence , was Monsieur Defarge's not unreasonable reply , at the commencement .
 Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance .
 in which he ought to have been perfect by that time , seeing that it had been the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village during a whole year .
 Jacques One struck in , and asked if he had ever seen the man before .
 Never , answered the mender of roads , recovering his perpendicular .
 Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then .
 You should have said , short as a dwarf , returned Jacques Two .
 He is right there , Jacques , murmured Defarge , to him who had interrupted .
 Go on .
 No matter , the number , said Defarge .
 He is well hidden , but at last he is unluckily found .
 Go on .
 With the aid of his indispensable cap , he represented a man with his elbows bound fast at his hips , with cords that were knotted behind him .
 He described it as if he were there , and it was evident that he saw it vividly .
 perhaps he had not seen much in his life .
 I do not show the soldiers that I recognise the tall man .
 he does not show the soldiers that he recognises me .
 we do it , and we know it , with our eyes .
 Come on .
 ' says the chief of that company , pointing to the village , bring him fast to his tomb .
 ' and they bring him faster .
 I follow .
 His arms are swelled because of being bound so tight , his wooden shoes are large and clumsy , and he is lame .
 Because he is lame , and consequently slow , they drive him with their gunslike this .
 He imitated the action of a man's being impelled forward by the butt-ends of muskets .
 As they descend the hill like madmen running a race , he falls .
 They laugh and pick him up again .
 His face is bleeding and covered with dust , but he cannot touch it .
 thereupon they laugh again .
 They bring him into the village .
 all the village runs to look .
 they take him past the mill , and up to the prison .
 all the village sees the prison gate open in the darkness of the night , and swallow himlike this .
 He opened his mouth as wide as he could , and shut it with a sounding snap of his teeth .
 Observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by opening it again , Defarge said , Go on , Jacques .
 Go on , Jacques , said Defarge .
 Listen then , Jacques , Number One of that name sternly interposed .
 Know that a petition was presented to the King and Queen .
 All here , yourself excepted , saw the King take it , in his carriage in the street , sitting beside the Queen .
 It is Defarge whom you see here , who , at the hazard of his life , darted out before the horses , with the petition in his hand .
 And once again listen , Jacques .
 said the kneeling Number Three : his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves , with a strikingly greedy air , as if he hungered for somethingthat was neither food nor drink .
 the guard , horse and foot , surrounded the petitioner , and struck him blows .
 You hear .
 I hear , messieurs .
 Go on then , said Defarge .
 Thirty-five , said the mender of roads , who looked sixty .
 It was done when you were more than ten years old .
 you might have seen it .
 Enough .
 said Defarge , with grim impatience .
 Long live the Devil .
 Go on .
 It is frightful , messieurs .
 How can the women and the children draw water .
 Who can gossip of an evening , under that shadow .
 Under it , have I said .
 When I left the village , Monday evening as the sun was going to bed , and looked back from the hill , the shadow struck across the church , across the mill , across the prisonseemed to strike across the earth , messieurs , to where the sky rests upon it .
 The hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the other three , and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him .
 That's all , messieurs .
 I left at sunset as I had been warned to do , and I walked on , that night and half next day , until I met as I was warned I should this comrade .
 With him , I came on , now riding and now walking , through the rest of yesterday and through last night .
 And here you see me .
 After a gloomy silence , the first Jacques said , Good .
 You have acted and recounted faithfully .
 Will you wait for us a little , outside the door .
 Very willingly , said the mender of roads .
 Whom Defarge escorted to the top of the stairs , and , leaving seated there , returned .
 The three had risen , and their heads were together when he came back to the garret .
 How say you , Jacques .
 demanded Number One .
 To be registered .
 To be registered , as doomed to destruction , returned Defarge .
 Magnificent .
 croaked the man with the craving .
 The chateau , and all the race .
 inquired the first .
 The chateau and all the race , returned Defarge .
 Extermination .
 The hungry man repeated , in a rapturous croak , Magnificent .
 and began gnawing another finger .
 He knows nothing , said Defarge .
 at least nothing more than would easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height .
 I charge myself with him .
 let him remain with me .
 I will take care of him , and set him on his road .
 He wishes to see the fine worldthe King , the Queen , and Court .
 let him see them on Sunday .
 What .
 exclaimed the hungry man , staring .
 Is it a good sign , that he wishes to see Royalty and Nobility .
 Jacques , said Defarge .
 judiciously show a cat milk , if you wish her to thirst for it .
 Judiciously show a dog his natural prey , if you wish him to bring it down one day .
 Worse quarters than Defarge's wine-shop , could easily have been found in Paris for a provincial slave of that degree .
 Saving for a mysterious dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted , his life was very new and agreeable .
 But , madame sat all day at her counter , so expressly unconscious of him , and so particularly determined not to perceive that his being there had any connection with anything below the surface , that he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her .
 For , he contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady might pretend next .
 and he felt assured that if she should take it into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a murder and afterwards flay the victim , she would infallibly go through with it until the play was played out .
 Therefore , when Sunday came , the mender of roads was not enchanted though he said he was to find that madame was to accompany monsieur and himself to Versailles .
 It was additionally disconcerting to have madame knitting all the way there , in a public conveyance .
 it was additionally disconcerting yet , to have madame in the crowd in the afternoon , still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to see the carriage of the King and Queen .
 You work hard , madame , said a man near her .
 Yes , answered Madame Defarge .
 I have a good deal to do .
 What do you make , madame .
 Many things .
 For instance , returned Madame Defarge , composedly , shrouds .
 The mender of roads was now coming to himself , and was mistrustful of having made a mistake in his late demonstrations .
 but no .
 You are the fellow we want , said Defarge , in his ear .
 you make these fools believe that it will last for ever .
 Then , they are the more insolent , and it is the nearer ended .
 Hey .
 cried the mender of roads , reflectively .
 that's true .
 Madame Defarge looked superciliously at the client , and nodded in confirmation .
 Truly , madame , I think so .
 For the moment .
 Truly yes , madame .
 It is true , madame .
 You have seen both dolls and birds to-day , said Madame Defarge , with a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent .
 now , go home .
 Chateau and hut , stone face and dangling figure , the red stain on the stone floor , and the pure water in the village wellthousands of acres of landa whole province of Franceall France itselflay under the night sky , concentrated into a faint hair-breadth line .
 So does a whole world , with all its greatnesses and littlenesses , lie in a twinkling star .
 And as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse the manner of its composition , so , sublimer intelligences may read in the feeble shining of this earth of ours , every thought and act , every vice and virtue , of every responsible creature on it .
 Say then , my friend .
 what did Jacques of the police tell thee .
 Very little to-night , but all he knows .
 There is another spy commissioned for our quarter .
 There may be many more , for all that he can say , but he knows of one .
 Eh well .
 said Madame Defarge , raising her eyebrows with a cool business air .
 It is necessary to register him .
 How do they call that man .
 He is English .
 So much the better .
 His name .
 Barsad , said Defarge , making it French by pronunciation .
 But , he had been so careful to get it accurately , that he then spelt it with perfect correctness .
 Barsad , repeated madame .
 Good .
 Christian name .
 John .
 Eh my faith .
 It is a portrait .
 said madame , laughing .
 He shall be registered to-morrow .
 The night was hot , and the shop , close shut and surrounded by so foul a neighbourhood , was ill-smelling .
 Monsieur Defarge's olfactory sense was by no means delicate , but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than it ever tasted , and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed .
 He whiffed the compound of scents away , as he put down his smoked-out pipe .
 You are fatigued , said madame , raising her glance as she knotted the money .
 There are only the usual odours .
 I am a little tired , her husband acknowledged .
 You are a little depressed , too , said madame , whose quick eyes had never been so intent on the accounts , but they had had a ray or two for him .
 Oh , the men , the men .
 But my dear .
 began Defarge .
 But my dear .
 repeated madame , nodding firmly .
 but my dear .
 You are faint of heart to-night , my dear .
 It does not take a long time to strike a man with Lightning , said Defarge .
 How long , demanded madame , composedly , does it take to make and store the lightning .
 Tell me .
 Defarge raised his head thoughtfully , as if there were something in that too .
 It does not take a long time , said madame , for an earthquake to swallow a town .
 Eh well .
 Tell me how long it takes to prepare the earthquake .
 A long time , I suppose , said Defarge .
 She tied a knot with flashing eyes , as if it throttled a foe .
 Well .
 said Defarge , with a half complaining and half apologetic shrug .
 We shall not see the triumph .
 We shall have helped it , returned madame , with her extended hand in strong action .
 Nothing that we do , is done in vain .
 I believe , with all my soul , that we shall see the triumph .
 But even if not , even if I knew certainly not , show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrant , and still I would .
 Then madame , with her teeth set , tied a very terrible knot indeed .
 Yes .
 But it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your victim and your opportunity , to sustain you .
 Sustain yourself without that .
 When the time comes , let loose a tiger and a devil .
 but wait for the time with the tiger and the devil chainednot shownyet always ready .
 A figure entering at the door threw a shadow on Madame Defarge which she felt to be a new one .
 She laid down her knitting , and began to pin her rose in her head-dress , before she looked at the figure .
 It was curious .
 The moment Madame Defarge took up the rose , the customers ceased talking , and began gradually to drop out of the wine-shop .
 Good day , madame , said the new-comer .
 Good day , monsieur .
 She said it aloud , but added to herself , as she resumed her knitting : Hah .
 Good day , age about forty , height about five feet nine , black hair , generally rather handsome visage , complexion dark , eyes dark , thin , long and sallow face , aquiline nose but not straight , having a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister expression .
 Good day , one and all .
 Have the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac , and a mouthful of cool fresh water , madame .
 Madame complied with a polite air .
 Marvellous cognac this , madame .
 It was the first time it had ever been so complemented , and Madame Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better .
 She said , however , that the cognac was flattered , and took up her knitting .
 The visitor watched her fingers for a few moments , and took the opportunity of observing the place in general .
 You knit with great skill , madame .
 I am accustomed to it .
 A pretty pattern too .
 YOU think so .
 said madame , looking at him with a smile .
 Decidedly .
 May one ask what it is for .
 Pastime , said madame , still looking at him with a smile while her fingers moved nimbly .
 Not for use .
 It was remarkable .
 but , the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge .
 Two men had entered separately , and had been about to order drink , when , catching sight of that novelty , they faltered , made a pretence of looking about as if for some friend who was not there , and went away .
 Nor , of those who had been there when this visitor entered , was there one left .
 They had all dropped off .
 The spy had kept his eyes open , but had been able to detect no sign .
 They had lounged away in a poverty-stricken , purposeless , accidental manner , quite natural and unimpeachable .
 JOHN , thought madame , checking off her work as her fingers knitted , and her eyes looked at the stranger .
 Stay long enough , and I shall knit BARSAD' before you go .
 You have a husband , madame .
 I have .
 Children .
 No children .
 Business seems bad .
 Business is very bad .
 the people are so poor .
 Ah , the unfortunate , miserable people .
 So oppressed , tooas you say .
 A bad business this , madame , of Gaspard's execution .
 Ah .
 the poor Gaspard .
 With a sigh of great compassion .
 I believe , said the spy , dropping his soft voice to a tone that invited confidence , and expressing an injured revolutionary susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face : I believe there is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood , touching the poor fellow .
 Between ourselves .
 Is there .
 asked madame , vacantly .
 Is there not .
 Here is my husband .
 said Madame Defarge .
 As the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door , the spy saluted him by touching his hat , and saying , with an engaging smile , Good day , Jacques .
 Defarge stopped short , and stared at him .
 Good day , Jacques .
 the spy repeated .
 with not quite so much confidence , or quite so easy a smile under the stare .
 You deceive yourself , monsieur , returned the keeper of the wine-shop .
 You mistake me for another .
 That is not my name .
 I am Ernest Defarge .
 Good day .
 answered Defarge , drily .
 No one has told me so , said Defarge , shaking his head .
 I know nothing of it .
 Not at all , but I hope to know it better .
 I am so profoundly interested in its miserable inhabitants .
 Hah .
 muttered Defarge .
 The pleasure of conversing with you , Monsieur Defarge , recalls to me , pursued the spy , that I have the honour of cherishing some interesting associations with your name .
 Indeed .
 said Defarge , with much indifference .
 Such is the fact , certainly , said Defarge .
 He had had it conveyed to him , in an accidental touch of his wife's elbow as she knitted and warbled , that he would do best to answer , but always with brevity .
 Such is the fact , repeated Defarge .
 Yes .
 said Defarge .
 You don't hear much about them now .
 said the spy .
 No , said Defarge .
 In effect , madame struck in , looking up from her work and her little song , we never hear about them .
 We received the news of their safe arrival , and perhaps another letter , or perhaps two .
 but , since then , they have gradually taken their road in lifewe , oursand we have held no correspondence .
 Perfectly so , madame , replied the spy .
 She is going to be married .
 Going .
 echoed madame .
 She was pretty enough to have been married long ago .
 You English are cold , it seems to me .
 Oh .
 You know I am English .
 I perceive your tongue is , returned madame .
 and what the tongue is , I suppose the man is .
 As he has said it , returned madame , lifting her eyebrows a little , it is probably false .
 But it may be true .
 If it is Defarge began , and stopped .
 If it is .
 repeated his wife .
 And if it does come , while we live to see it triumphI hope , for her sake , Destiny will keep her husband out of France .
 Her husband's destiny , said Madame Defarge , with her usual composure , will take him where he is to go , and will lead him to the end that is to end him .
 That is all I know .
 Stranger things than that will happen when it does come , answered madame .
 I have them both here , of a certainty .
 and they are both here for their merits .
 that is enough .
 She rolled up her knitting when she had said those words , and presently took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her head .
 Either Saint Antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable decoration was gone , or Saint Antoine was on the watch for its disappearance .
 howbeit , the Saint took courage to lounge in , very shortly afterwards , and the wine-shop recovered its habitual aspect .
 But , as the fingers went , the eyes went , and the thoughts .
 And as Madame Defarge moved on from group to group , all three went quicker and fiercer among every little knot of women that she had spoken with , and left behind .
 Never did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in Soho , than one memorable evening when the Doctor and his daughter sat under the plane-tree together .
 Never did the moon rise with a milder radiance over great London , than on that night when it found them still seated under the tree , and shone upon their faces through its leaves .
 Lucie was to be married to-morrow .
 She had reserved this last evening for her father , and they sat alone under the plane-tree .
 You are happy , my dear father .
 Quite , my child .
 They had said little , though they had been there a long time .
 When it was yet light enough to work and read , she had neither engaged herself in her usual work , nor had she read to him .
 She had employed herself in both ways , at his side under the tree , many and many a time .
 but , this time was not quite like any other , and nothing could make it so .
 "And I am very happy to-night , dear father .
 I am deeply happy in the love that Heaven has so blessedmy love for Charles , and Charles's love for me .
 But , if my life were not to be still consecrated to you , or if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us , even by the length of a few of these streets , I should be more unhappy and self-reproachful now than I can tell you .
 Even as it is .
 Even as it was , she could not command her voice .
 In the sad moonlight , she clasped him by the neck , and laid her face upon his breast .
 In the moonlight which is always sad , as the light of the sun itself isas the light called human life isat its coming and its going .
 Dearest dear .
 Can you tell me , this last time , that you feel quite , quite sure , no new affections of mine , and no new duties of mine , will ever interpose between us .
 I know it well , but do you know it .
 In your own heart , do you feel quite certain .
 If I could hope THAT , my father .
 Believe it , love .
 Indeed it is so .
 Consider how natural and how plain it is , my dear , that it should be so .
 You , devoted and young , cannot fully appreciate the anxiety I have felt that your life should not be wasted .
 She moved her hand towards his lips , but he took it in his , and repeated the word .
 If I had never seen Charles , my father , I should have been quite happy with you .
 He smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy without Charles , having seen him .
 and replied : 
 It was the first time , except at the trial , of her ever hearing him refer to the period of his suffering .
 It gave her a strange and new sensation while his words were in her ears .
 and she remembered it long afterwards .
 See .
 said the Doctor of Beauvais , raising his hand towards the moon .
 I have looked at her from my prison-window , when I could not bear her light .
 I have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think of her shining upon what I had lost , that I have beaten my head against my prison-walls .
 I have looked at her , in a state so dun and lethargic , that I have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal lines I could draw across her at the full , and the number of perpendicular lines with which I could intersect them .
 " He added in his inward and pondering manner , as he looked at the moon , "It was twenty either way , I remember , and the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in .
 The strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time , deepened as he dwelt upon it .
 but , there was nothing to shock her in the manner of his reference .
 He only seemed to contrast his present cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over .
 She drew closer to him , and kissed his cheek and his hand .
 My father .
 Even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter who never existed , strikes to my heart as if I had been that child .
 You , Lucie .
 It is out of the Consolation and restoration you have brought to me , that these remembrances arise , and pass between us and the moon on this last night .
 What did I say just now .
 So .
 But on other moonlight nights , when the sadness and the silence have touched me in a different wayhave affected me with something as like a sorrowful sense of peace , as any emotion that had pain for its foundations couldI have imagined her as coming to me in my cell , and leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress .
 I have seen her image in the moonlight often , as I now see you .
 except that I never held her in my arms .
 it stood between the little grated window and the door .
 But , you understand that that was not the child I am speaking of .
 No .
 That was another thing .
 It stood before my disturbed sense of sight , but it never moved .
 The phantom that my mind pursued , was another and more real child .
 Of her outward appearance I know no more than that she was like her mother .
 The other had that likeness tooas you havebut was not the same .
 Can you follow me , Lucie .
 The meaning , monsieur .
 Does it mean a captive , or a place of captivity .
 Or do you mean that I shall strike you dead .
 Kill him .
 croaked Jacques Three , who had come close up .
 Monsieur , it is a cell .
 Show it me .
 Pass this way , then .
 Jacques Three , with his usual craving on him , and evidently disappointed by the dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to promise bloodshed , held by Defarge's arm as he held by the turnkey's .
 Their three heads had been close together during this brief discourse , and it had been as much as they could do to hear one another , even then : so tremendous was the noise of the living ocean , in its irruption into the Fortress , and its inundation of the courts and passages and staircases .
 All around outside , too , it beat the walls with a deep , hoarse roar , from which , occasionally , some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped into the air like spray .
 One hundred and five , North Tower .
 Pass that torch slowly along these walls , that I may see them , said Defarge to the turnkey .
 The man obeyed , and Defarge followed the light closely with his eyes .
 Stop .
 Look here , Jacques .
 croaked Jacques Three , as he read greedily .
 He had still the linstock of his gun in his own hand .
 He made a sudden exchange of the two instruments , and turning on the worm-eaten stool and table , beat them to pieces in a few blows .
 Nothing in the wood , and nothing in the straw , Jacques .
 Nothing .
 Let us collect them together , in the middle of the cell .
 So .
 Light them , you .
 The turnkey fired the little pile , which blazed high and hot .
 Stooping again to come out at the low-arched door , they left it burning , and retraced their way to the courtyard .
 seeming to recover their sense of hearing as they came down , until they were in the raging flood once more .
 They found it surging and tossing , in quest of Defarge himself .
 Saint Antoine was clamorous to have its wine-shop keeper foremost in the guard upon the governor who had defended the Bastille and shot the people .
 Otherwise , the governor would not be marched to the Hotel de Ville for judgment .
 Otherwise , the governor would escape , and the people's blood suddenly of some value , after many years of worthlessness be unavenged .
 The sea of black and threatening waters , and of destructive upheaving of wave against wave , whose depths were yet unfathomed and whose forces were yet unknown .
 The remorseless sea of turbulently swaying shapes , voices of vengeance , and faces hardened in the furnaces of suffering until the touch of pity could make no mark on them .
 Haggard Saint Antoine had had only one exultant week , in which to soften his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could , with the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations , when Madame Defarge sat at her counter , as usual , presiding over the customers .
 Madame Defarge wore no rose in her head , for the great brotherhood of Spies had become , even in one short week , extremely chary of trusting themselves to the saint's mercies .
 The lamps across his streets had a portentously elastic swing with them .
 Madame Defarge , with her arms folded , sat in the morning light and heat , contemplating the wine-shop and the street .
 In both , there were several knots of loungers , squalid and miserable , but now with a manifest sense of power enthroned on their distress .
 The raggedest nightcap , awry on the wretchedest head , had this crooked significance in it : I know how hard it has grown for me , the wearer of this , to support life in myself .
 but do you know how easy it has grown for me , the wearer of this , to destroy life in you .
 Every lean bare arm , that had been without work before , had this work always ready for it now , that it could strike .
 The fingers of the knitting women were vicious , with the experience that they could tear .
 There was a change in the appearance of Saint Antoine .
 the image had been hammering into this for hundreds of years , and the last finishing blows had told mightily on the expression .
 As if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of Saint Antoine Quarter to the wine-shop door , had been suddenly fired , a fast-spreading murmur came rushing along .
 It is Defarge , said madame .
 Silence , patriots .
 Defarge came in breathless , pulled off a red cap he wore , and looked around him .
 Listen , everywhere .
 said madame again .
 Listen to him .
 Defarge stood , panting , against a background of eager eyes and open mouths , formed outside the door .
 all those within the wine-shop had sprung to their feet .
 News from the other world .
 How , then .
 cried madame , contemptuously .
 The other world .
 Does everybody here recall old Foulon , who told the famished people that they might eat grass , and who died , and went to Hell .
 Everybody .
 from all throats .
 The news is of him .
 He is among us .
 Among us .
 from the universal throat again .
 And dead .
 Wretched old sinner of more than threescore years and ten , if he had never known it yet , he would have known it in his heart of hearts if he could have heard the answering cry .
 A moment of profound silence followed .
 Defarge and his wife looked steadfastly at one another .
 The Vengeance stooped , and the jar of a drum was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter .
 Instantly Madame Defarge's knife was in her girdle .
 the drum was beating in the streets , as if it and a drummer had flown together by magic .
 and The Vengeance , uttering terrific shrieks , and flinging her arms about her head like all the forty Furies at once , was tearing from house to house , rousing the women .
 Nevertheless , not a moment was lost .
 not a moment .
 This Foulon was at the Hotel de Ville , and might be loosed .
 Never , if Saint Antoine knew his own sufferings , insults , and wrongs .
 Armed men and women flocked out of the Quarter so fast , and drew even these last dregs after them with such a force of suction , that within a quarter of an hour there was not a human creature in Saint Antoine's bosom but a few old crones and the wailing children .
 No .
 They were all by that time choking the Hall of Examination where this old man , ugly and wicked , was , and overflowing into the adjacent open space and streets .
 The Defarges , husband and wife , The Vengeance , and Jacques Three , were in the first press , and at no great distance from him in the Hall .
 See .
 cried madame , pointing with her knife .
 See the old villain bound with ropes .
 That was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon his back .
 Ha , ha .
 That was well done .
 Let him eat it now .
 Madame put her knife under her arm , and clapped her hands as at a play .
 Not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children , wailing and breadless .
 Then , the miserable bakers' shops were beset by long files of them , patiently waiting to buy bad bread .
 and while they waited with stomachs faint and empty , they beguiled the time by embracing one another on the triumphs of the day , and achieving them again in gossip .
 Gradually , these strings of ragged people shortened and frayed away .
 and then poor lights began to shine in high windows , and slender fires were made in the streets , at which neighbours cooked in common , afterwards supping at their doors .
 At last it is come , my dear .
 But , this was not the change on the village , and on many a village like it .
 For scores of years gone by , Monseigneur had squeezed it and wrung it , and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures of the chasenow , found in hunting the people .
 now , found in hunting the beasts , for whose preservation Monseigneur made edifying spaces of barbarous and barren wilderness .
 No .
 The change consisted in the appearance of strange faces of low caste , rather than in the disappearance of the high caste , chiselled , and otherwise beautified and beautifying features of Monseigneur .
 The man looked at him , looked at the village in the hollow , at the mill , and at the prison on the crag .
 When he had identified these objects in what benighted mind he had , he said , in a dialect that was just intelligible : 
 How goes it , Jacques .
 All well , Jacques .
 Touch then .
 They joined hands , and the man sat down on the heap of stones .
 No dinner .
 Nothing but supper now , said the mender of roads , with a hungry face .
 It is the fashion , growled the man .
 I meet no dinner anywhere .
 Touch then .
 It was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this time , after observing these operations .
 They again joined hands .
 To-night .
 said the mender of roads .
 To-night , said the man , putting the pipe in his mouth .
 Where .
 Here .
 Show me .
 said the traveller then , moving to the brow of the hill .
 See .
 returned the mender of roads , with extended finger .
 You go down here , and straight through the street , and past the fountain
.
 To the Devil with all that .
 interrupted the other , rolling his eye over the landscape .
 I go through no streets and past no fountains .
 Well .
 Good .
 When do you cease to work .
 At sunset .
 Will you wake me , before departing .
 I have walked two nights without resting .
 Let me finish my pipe , and I shall sleep like a child .
 Will you wake me .
 Surely .
 Good .
 said the sleeper , rising on his elbow .
 Two leagues beyond the summit of the hill .
 The rider from the chateau , and the horse in a foam , clattered away through the village , and galloped up the stony steep , to the prison on the crag .
 At the gate , a group of officers were looking at the fire .
 removed from them , a group of soldiers .
 Help , gentlemenofficers .
 The chateau is on fire .
 valuable objects may be saved from the flames by timely aid .
 Help , help .
 The officers looked towards the soldiers who looked at the fire .
 gave no orders .
 and answered , with shrugs and biting of lips , It must burn .
 Within a hundred miles , and in the light of other fires , there were other functionaries less fortunate , that night and other nights , whom the rising sun found hanging across once-peaceful streets , where they had been born and bred .
 also , there were other villagers and townspeople less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows , upon whom the functionaries and soldiery turned with success , and whom they strung up in their turn .
 But , the fierce figures were steadily wending East , West , North , and South , be that as it would .
 and whosoever hung , fire burned .
 The altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it , no functionary , by any stretch of mathematics , was able to calculate successfully .
 In such risings of fire and risings of seathe firm earth shaken by the rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb , but was always on the flow , higher and higher , to the terror and wonder of the beholders on the shorethree years of tempest were consumed .
 Three more birthdays of little Lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful tissue of the life of her home .
 The August of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two was come , and Monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide .
 But , although you are the youngest man that ever lived , said Charles Darnay , rather hesitating , I must still suggest to you .
 I understand .
 That I am too old .
 said MrLorry .
 Unsettled weather , a long journey , uncertain means of travelling , a disorganised country , a city that may not be even safe for you .
 Indeed .
 You are a pretty fellow to object and advise .
 exclaimed MrLorry .
 You wish you were going yourself .
 And you a Frenchman born .
 You are a wise counsellor .
 When you were talking to Lucie , MrLorry repeated .
 Yes .
 I wonder you are not ashamed to mention the name of Lucie .
 Wishing you were going to France at this time of day .
 However , I am not going , said Charles Darnay , with a smile .
 It is more to the purpose that you say you are .
 How I admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit , MrLorry .
 Tut .
 Nonsense , sir .
 And , my dear Charles , said MrLorry , glancing at the House again , you are to remember , that getting things out of Paris at this present time , no matter what things , is next to an impossibility .
 Papers and precious matters were this very day brought to us here I speak in strict confidence .
 it is not business-like to whisper it , even to you , by the strangest bearers you can imagine , every one of whom had his head hanging on by a single hair as he passed the Barriers .
 At another time , our parcels would come and go , as easily as in business-like Old England .
 but now , everything is stopped .
 And do you really go to-night .
 And do you take no one with you .
 All sorts of people have been proposed to me , but I will have nothing to say to any of them .
 I intend to take Jerry .
 Jerry has been my bodyguard on Sunday nights for a long time past and I am used to him .
 Nobody will suspect Jerry of being anything but an English bull-dog , or of having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his master .
 I must say again that I heartily admire your gallantry and youthfulness .
 I must say again , nonsense , nonsense .
 When I have executed this little commission , I shall , perhaps , accept Tellson's proposal to retire and live at my ease .
 Time enough , then , to think about growing old .
 On the marriage morning , Doctor Manette had made it his one urgent and express request to Charles Darnay , that the secret of this name should beunless he , the Doctor , dissolved the obligationkept inviolate between them .
 Nobody else knew it to be his name .
 his own wife had no suspicion of the fact .
 MrLorry could have none .
 No , said MrLorry , in reply to the House .
 I have referred it , I think , to everybody now here , and no one can tell me where this gentleman is to be found .
 Nephew , I believebut in any case degenerate successorof the polished Marquis who was murdered , said one .
 Happy to say , I never knew him .
 Infected with the new doctrines , said a third , eyeing the direction through his glass in passing .
 set himself in opposition to the last Marquis , abandoned the estates when he inherited them , and left them to the ruffian herd .
 They will recompense him now , I hope , as he deserves .
 Hey .
 cried the blatant Stryver .
 Did he though .
 Is that the sort of fellow .
 Let us look at his infamous name .
 Dn the fellow .
 I know the fellow .
 Do you , by Jupiter .
 said Stryver .
 I am sorry for it .
 Why .
 Why , MrDarnay .
 D'ye hear what he did .
 Don't ask , why , in these times .
 But I do ask why .
 I understand how to put YOU in a corner , MrDarnay , said Bully Stryver , and I'll do it .
 If this fellow is a gentleman , I DON'T understand him .
 You may tell him so , with my compliments .
 You may also tell him , from me , that after abandoning his worldly goods and position to this butcherly mob , I wonder he is not at the head of them .
 But , no , gentlemen , said Stryver , looking all round , and snapping his fingers , I know something of human nature , and I tell you that you'll never find a fellow like this fellow , trusting himself to the mercies of such precious PROTEGES .
 No , gentlemen .
 he'll always show ëem a clean pair of heels very early in the scuffle , and sneak away .
 With those words , and a final snap of his fingers , MrStryver shouldered himself into Fleet-street , amidst the general approbation of his hearers .
 MrLorry and Charles Darnay were left alone at the desk , in the general departure from the Bank .
 Will you take charge of the letter .
 said MrLorry .
 You know where to deliver it .
 I do .
 Will you undertake to explain , that we suppose it to have been addressed here , on the chance of our knowing where to forward it , and that it has been here some time .
 I will do so .
 Do you start for Paris from here .
 From here , at eight .
 I will come back , to see you off .
 MONSIEUR HERETOFORE THE MARQUIS .
 Ah .
 most gracious Monsieur heretofore the Marquis , where is that emigrant .
 I cry in my sleep where is he .
 I demand of Heaven , will he not come to deliver me .
 No answer .
 Ah Monsieur heretofore the Marquis , I send my desolate cry across the sea , hoping it may perhaps reach your ears through the great bank of Tilson known at Paris .
 From this prison here of horror , whence I every hour tend nearer and nearer to destruction , I send you , Monsieur heretofore the Marquis , the assurance of my dolorous and unhappy service .
 Your afflicted .
 Gabelle .
 This favoured the desperate resolution Charles Darnay had begun to make , that he would go to Paris .
 His resolution was made .
 He must go to Paris .
 He walked to and fro , with thoughts very busy , until it was time to return to Tellson's and take leave of MrLorry .
 As soon as he arrived in Paris he would present himself to this old friend , but he must say nothing of his intention now .
 A carriage with post-horses was ready at the Bank door , and Jerry was booted and equipped .
 I have delivered that letter , said Charles Darnay to MrLorry .
 I would not consent to your being charged with any written answer , but perhaps you will take a verbal one .
 That I will , and readily , said MrLorry , if it is not dangerous .
 And what is the message to the unfortunate Gabelle in prison .
 Simply , ëthat he has received the letter , and will come .
 Any time mentioned .
 He will start upon his journey to-morrow night .
 Any person mentioned .
 No .
 That nightit was the fourteenth of Augusthe sat up late , and wrote two fervent letters .
 one was to Lucie , explaining the strong obligation he was under to go to Paris , and showing her , at length , the reasons that he had , for feeling confident that he could become involved in no personal danger there .
 the other was to the Doctor , confiding Lucie and their dear child to his care , and dwelling on the same topics with the strongest assurances .
 To both , he wrote that he would despatch letters in proof of his safety , immediately after his arrival .
 The unseen force was drawing him fast to itself , now , and all the tides and winds were setting straight and strong towards it .
 He left his two letters with a trusty porter , to be delivered half an hour before midnight , and no sooner .
 took horse for Dover .
 and began his journey .
 For the love of Heaven , of justice , of generosity , of the honour of your noble name .
 was the poor prisoner's cry with which he strengthened his sinking heart , as he left all that was dear on earth behind him , and floated away for the Loadstone Rock .
 The end of the second book .
 A very few French leagues of his journey were accomplished , when Charles Darnay began to perceive that for him along these country roads there was no hope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen at Paris .
 Whatever might befall now , he must on to his journey's end .
 Not a mean village closed upon him , not a common barrier dropped across the road behind him , but he knew it to be another iron door in the series that was barred between him and England .
 The universal watchfulness so encompassed him , that if he had been taken in a net , or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage , he could not have felt his freedom more completely gone .
 Nothing but the production of the afflicted Gabelle's letter from his prison of the Abbaye would have got him on so far .
 His difficulty at the guard-house in this small place had been such , that he felt his journey to have come to a crisis .
 And he was , therefore , as little surprised as a man could be , to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he had been remitted until morning , in the middle of the night .
 Emigrant , said the functionary , I am going to send you on to Paris , under an escort .
 Citizen , I desire nothing more than to get to Paris , though I could dispense with the escort .
 Silence .
 growled a red-cap , striking at the coverlet with the butt-end of his musket .
 Peace , aristocrat .
 I have no choice , said Charles Darnay .
 Choice .
 Listen to him .
 cried the same scowling red-cap .
 As if it was not a favour to be protected from the lamp-iron .
 It is always as the good patriot says , observed the functionary .
 Rise and dress yourself , emigrant .
 Emigrant , my friends .
 Do you not see me here , in France , of my own will .
 The postmaster interposed himself between this man and the rider's bridle at which he was evidently making , and soothingly said , Let him be .
 let him be .
 He will be judged at Paris .
 He lies .
 cried the smith .
 He is a traitor since the decree .
 His life is forfeit to the people .
 His cursed life is not his own .
 What is this decree that the smith spoke of .
 Darnay asked the postmaster , when he had thanked him , and stood beside him in the yard .
 Truly , a decree for selling the property of emigrants .
 When passed .
 On the fourteenth .
 The day I left England .
 Everybody says it is but one of several , and that there will be othersif there are not alreadybanishing all emigrants , and condemning all to death who return .
 That is what he meant when he said your life was not your own .
 But there are no such decrees yet .
 Daylight at last found them before the wall of Paris .
 The barrier was closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it .
 Where are the papers of this prisoner .
 demanded a resolute-looking man in authority , who was summoned out by the guard .
 When he had sat in his saddle some half-hour , taking note of these things , Darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority , who directed the guard to open the barrier .
 Then he delivered to the escort , drunk and sober , a receipt for the escorted , and requested him to dismount .
 He did so , and the two patriots , leading his tired horse , turned and rode away without entering the city .
 Citizen Defarge , said he to Darnay's conductor , as he took a slip of paper to write on .
 Is this the emigrant Evremonde .
 This is the man .
 Your age , Evremonde .
 Thirty-seven .
 Married , Evremonde .
 Yes .
 Where married .
 In England .
 Without doubt .
 Where is your wife , Evremonde .
 In England .
 Without doubt .
 You are consigned , Evremonde , to the prison of La Force .
 Just Heaven .
 exclaimed Darnay .
 Under what law , and for what offence .
 The officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment .
 We have new laws , Evremonde , and new offences , since you were here .
 He said it with a hard smile , and went on writing .
 Defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany him .
 The prisoner obeyed , and a guard of two armed patriots attended them .
 Yes , replied Darnay , looking at him with surprise .
 My wife came to your house to reclaim her father .
 Yes .
 The word wife seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to Defarge , to say with sudden impatience , In the name of that sharp female newly-born , and called La Guillotine , why did you come to France .
 You heard me say why , a minute ago .
 Do you not believe it is the truth .
 A bad truth for you , said Defarge , speaking with knitted brows , and looking straight before him .
 Indeed I am lost here .
 All here is so unprecedented , so changed , so sudden and unfair , that I am absolutely lost .
 Will you render me a little help .
 None .
 Defarge spoke , always looking straight before him .
 Will you answer me a single question .
 Perhaps .
 According to its nature .
 You can say what it is .
 In this prison that I am going to so unjustly , shall I have some free communication with the world outside .
 You will see .
 I am not to be buried there , prejudged , and without any means of presenting my case .
 You will see .
 But , what then .
 Other people have been similarly buried in worse prisons , before now .
 But never by me , Citizen Defarge .
 Defarge glanced darkly at him for answer , and walked on in a steady and set silence .
 The deeper he sank into this silence , the fainter hope there wasor so Darnay thoughtof his softening in any slight degree .
 He , therefore , made haste to say : 
 I will do , Defarge doggedly rejoined , nothing for you .
 My duty is to my country and the People .
 I am the sworn servant of both , against you .
 I will do nothing for you .
 Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further , and his pride was touched besides .
 As they walked on in silence , he could not but see how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the streets .
 The very children scarcely noticed him .
 A few passers turned their heads , and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat .
 otherwise , that a man in good clothes should be going to prison , was no more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be going to work .
 In one narrow , dark , and dirty street through which they passed , an excited orator , mounted on a stool , was addressing an excited audience on the crimes against the people , of the king and the royal family .
 The few words that he caught from this man's lips , first made it known to Charles Darnay that the king was in prison , and that the foreign ambassadors had one and all left Paris .
 On the road except at Beauvais he had heard absolutely nothing .
 The escort and the universal watchfulness had completely isolated him .
 That he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had developed themselves when he left England , he of course knew now .
 That perils had thickened about him fast , and might thicken faster and faster yet , he of course knew now .
 He could not but admit to himself that he might not have made this journey , if he could have foreseen the events of a few days .
 And yet his misgivings were not so dark as , imagined by the light of this later time , they would appear .
 Troubled as the future was , it was the unknown future , and in its obscurity there was ignorant hope .
 The horrible massacre , days and nights long , which , within a few rounds of the clock , was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed garnering time of harvest , was as far out of his knowledge as if it had been a hundred thousand years away .
 The sharp female newly-born , and called La Guillotine , was hardly known to him , or to the generality of people , by name .
 The frightful deeds that were to be soon done , were probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers .
 How could they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind .
 What the Devil .
 How many more of them .
 exclaimed the man with the bloated face .
 What the Devil , I say again .
 exclaimed the gaoler , left with his wife .
 How many more .
 In secret , too , grumbled the gaoler , looking at the written paper .
 As if I was not already full to bursting .
 Come .
 said the chief , at length taking up his keys , come with me , emigrant .
 In the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and disgrace , the new-comer recoiled from this company .
 But the crowning unreality of his long unreal ride , was , their all at once rising to receive him , with every refinement of manner known to the time , and with all the engaging graces and courtesies of life .
 So strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and gloom , so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and misery through which they were seen , that Charles Darnay seemed to stand in a company of the dead .
 Ghosts all .
 The ghost of beauty , the ghost of stateliness , the ghost of elegance , the ghost of pride , the ghost of frivolity , the ghost of wit , the ghost of youth , the ghost of age , all waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore , all turning on him eyes that were changed by the death they had died in coming there .
 Charles Darnay roused himself , and gave the required information , in words as suitable as he could find .
 I do not understand the meaning of the term , but I have heard them say so .
 There was a murmur of commiseration as Charles Darnay crossed the room to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him , and many voicesamong which , the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuousgave him good wishes and encouragement .
 He turned at the grated door , to render the thanks of his heart .
 it closed under the gaoler's hand .
 and the apparitions vanished from his sight forever .
 The wicket opened on a stone staircase , leading upward .
 When they had ascended forty steps the prisoner of half an hour already counted them , the gaoler opened a low black door , and they passed into a solitary cell .
 It struck cold and damp , but was not dark .
 Yours , said the gaoler .
 Why am I confined alone .
 How do I know .
 I can buy pen , ink , and paper .
 What money would be drawn out of Tellson's henceforth , and what would lie there , lost and forgotten .
 what plate and jewels would tarnish in Tellson's hiding-places , while the depositors rusted in prisons , and when they should have violently perished .
 how many accounts with Tellson's never to be balanced in this world , must be carried over into the next .
 no man could have said , that night , any more than MrJarvis Lorry could , though he thought heavily of these questions .
 He sat by a newly-lighted wood fire the blighted and unfruitful year was prematurely cold , and on his honest and courageous face there was a deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw , or any object in the room distortedly reflecta shade of horror .
 Thank God , said MrLorry , clasping his hands , that no one near and dear to me is in this dreadful town to-night .
 May He have mercy on all who are in danger .
 Soon afterwards , the bell at the great gate sounded , and he thought , They have come back .
 and sat listening .
 But , there was no loud irruption into the courtyard , as he had expected , and he heard the gate clash again , and all was quiet .
 Your husband , Lucie .
 What of Charles .
 Here .
 Here , in Paris .
 The old man uttered an irrepressible cry .
 Almost at the same moment , the beg of the great gate rang again , and a loud noise of feet and voices came pouring into the courtyard .
 The Doctor turned , with his hand upon the fastening of the window , and said , with a cool , bold smile : 
 My dear friend , I have a charmed life in this city .
 I have been a Bastille prisoner .
 There is no patriot in Parisin Paris .
 In Francewho , knowing me to have been a prisoner in the Bastille , would touch me , except to overwhelm me with embraces , or carry me in triumph .
 My old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the barrier , and gained us news of Charles there , and brought us here .
 I knew it would be so .
 I knew I could help Charles out of all danger .
 I told Lucie so .
 What is that noise .
 His hand was again upon the window .
 Don't look .
 cried MrLorry , absolutely desperate .
 No , Lucie , my dear , nor you .
 He got his arm round her , and held her .
 Don't be so terrified , my love .
 I solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm having happened to Charles .
 that I had no suspicion even of his being in this fatal place .
 What prison is he in .
 Lucie , my child , if ever you were brave and serviceable in your lifeand you were always bothyou will compose yourself now , to do exactly as I bid you .
 for more depends upon it than you can think , or I can say .
 There is no help for you in any action on your part to-night .
 you cannot possibly stir out .
 I say this , because what I must bid you to do for Charles's sake , is the hardest thing to do of all .
 You must instantly be obedient , still , and quiet .
 You must let me put you in a room at the back here .
 You must leave your father and me alone for two minutes , and as there are Life and Death in the world you must not delay .
 I will be submissive to you .
 I see in your face that you know I can do nothing else than this .
 I know you are true .
 But , such awful workers , and such awful work .
 All this was seen in a moment , as the vision of a drowning man , or of any human creature at any very great pass , could see a world if it were there .
 They drew back from the window , and the Doctor looked for explanation in his friend's ashy face .
 Lucie had , by that time , fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet , clinging to his hand .
 Miss Pross had laid the child down on his own bed , and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty charge .
 O the long , long night , with the moans of the poor wife .
 And O the long , long night , with no return of her father and no tidings .
 The great grindstone , Earth , had turned when MrLorry looked out again , and the sun was red on the courtyard .
 But , the lesser grindstone stood alone there in the calm morning air , with a red upon it that the sun had never given , and would never take away .
 One of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of MrLorry when business hours came round , was this : that he had no right to imperil Tellson's by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under the Bank roof .
 His own possessions , safety , life , he would have hazarded for Lucie and her child , without a moment's demur .
 but the great trust he held was not his own , and as to that business charge he was a strict man of business .
 Your servant , said MrLorry .
 Do you know me .
 I have seen you somewhere .
 Perhaps at my wine shop .
 And what says he .
 What does he send me .
 Defarge gave into his anxious hand , an open scrap of paper .
 It bore the words in the Doctor's writing : 
 Charles is safe , but I cannot safely leave this place yet .
 I have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note from Charles to his wife .
 Let the bearer see his wife .
 It was dated from La Force , within an hour .
 Yes , returned Defarge .
 Scarcely noticing as yet , in what a curiously reserved and mechanical way Defarge spoke , MrLorry put on his hat and they went down into the courtyard .
 There , they found two women .
 one , knitting .
 It is she , observed her husband .
 Does Madame go with us .
 inquired MrLorry , seeing that she moved as they moved .
 That she may be able to recognise the faces and know the persons .
 It is for their safety .
 Beginning to be struck by Defarge's manner , MrLorry looked dubiously at him , and led the way .
 Both the women followed .
 the second woman being The Vengeance .
 There was something in its touch that gave Lucie a check .
 She stopped in the act of putting the note in her bosom , and , with her hands yet at her neck , looked terrified at Madame Defarge .
 Madame Defarge met the lifted eyebrows and forehead with a cold , impassive stare .
 You had better , Lucie , said MrLorry , doing all he could to propitiate , by tone and manner , have the dear child here , and our good Pross .
 Our good Pross , Defarge , is an English lady , and knows no French .
 Yes , madame , answered MrLorry .
 this is our poor prisoner's darling daughter , and only child .
 The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed to fall so threatening and dark on the child , that her mother instinctively kneeled on the ground beside her , and held her to her breast .
 The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to fall , threatening and dark , on both the mother and the child .
 It is enough , my husband , said Madame Defarge .
 I have seen them .
 We may go .
 You will be good to my poor husband .
 You will do him no harm .
 You will help me to see him if you can .
 For my sake , then , be merciful to my husband .
 For my child's sake .
 She will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful .
 We are more afraid of you than of these others .
 Madame Defarge received it as a compliment , and looked at her husband .
 Defarge , who had been uneasily biting his thumb-nail and looking at her , collected his face into a sterner expression .
 What is it that your husband says in that little letter .
 asked Madame Defarge , with a lowering smile .
 You can be when you choose .
 I can pass in and out when I choose .
 Sydney Carton filled another glass with brandy , poured it slowly out upon the hearth , and watched it as it dropped .
 It being all spent , he said , rising : 
 So far , we have spoken before these two , because it was as well that the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me .
 Come into the dark room here , and let us have one final word alone .
 While Sydney Carton and the Sheep of the prisons were in the adjoining dark room , speaking so low that not a sound was heard , MrLorry looked at Jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust .
 That honest tradesman's manner of receiving the look , did not inspire confidence .
 he changed the leg on which he rested , as often as if he had fifty of those limbs , and were trying them all .
 he examined his finger-nails with a very questionable closeness of attention .
 and whenever MrLorry's eye caught his , he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the hollow of a hand before it , which is seldom , if ever , known to be an infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character .
 MrCruncher came forward sideways , with one of his shoulders in advance of him .
 What have you been , besides a messenger .
 After some cogitation , accompanied with an intent look at his patron , MrCruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying , Agicultooral character .
 My mind misgives me much , said MrLorry , angrily shaking a forefinger at him , that you have used the respectable and great house of Tellson's as a blind , and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous description .
 If you have , don't expect me to befriend you when you get back to England .
 If you have , don't expect me to keep your secret .
 Tellson's shall not be imposed upon .
 Now , what I would humbly offer to you , sir , pursued MrCruncher , even if it wos so , which I don't say it is .
 Don't prevaricate , said MrLorry .
 That at least is true , said MrLorry .
 Say no more now .
 It may be that I shall yet stand your friend , if you deserve it , and repent in actionnot in words .
 I want no more words .
 MrCruncher knuckled his forehead , as Sydney Carton and the spy returned from the dark room .
 Adieu , MrBarsad , said the former .
 our arrangement thus made , you have nothing to fear from me .
 He sat down in a chair on the hearth , over against MrLorry .
 When they were alone , MrLorry asked him what he had done .
 Not much .
 If it should go ill with the prisoner , I have ensured access to him , once .
 MrLorry's countenance fell .
 But access to him , said MrLorry , if it should go ill before the Tribunal , will not save him .
 I never said it would .
 To return to poor Darnay , said Carton .
 Don't tell Her of this interview , or this arrangement .
 It would not enable Her to go to see him .
 She might think it was contrived , in case of the worse , to convey to him the means of anticipating the sentence .
 I am going now , directly .
 I am glad of that .
 She has such a strong attachment to you and reliance on you .
 How does she look .
 Anxious and unhappy , but very beautiful .
 Ah .
 I forgot it , he said .
 MrLorry's eyes were again attracted to his face .
 Taking note of the wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features , and having the expression of prisoners' faces fresh in his mind , he was strongly reminded of that expression .
 And your duties here have drawn to an end , sir .
 said Carton , turning to him .
 Yes .
 As I was telling you last night when Lucie came in so unexpectedly , I have at length done all that I can do here .
 I hoped to have left them in perfect safety , and then to have quitted Paris .
 I have my Leave to Pass .
 I was ready to go .
 They were both silent .
 Yours is a long life to look back upon , sir .
 said Carton , wistfully .
 I am in my seventy-eighth year .
 You have been useful all your life .
 steadily and constantly occupied .
 trusted , respected , and looked up to .
 I have been a man of business , ever since I have been a man .
 Indeed , I may say that I was a man of business when a boy .
 See what a place you fill at seventy-eight .
 How many people will miss you when you leave it empty .
 A solitary old bachelor , answered MrLorry , shaking his head .
 There is nobody to weep for me .
 How can you say that .
 Wouldn't She weep for you .
 Wouldn't her child .
 Surely , surely .
 You say truly , MrCarton .
 I think they would be .
 I understand the feeling .
 exclaimed Carton , with a bright flush .
 And you are the better for it .
 I hope so .
 Carton terminated the conversation here , by rising to help him on with his outer coat .
 But you , said MrLorry , reverting to the theme , you are young .
 Yes , said Carton .
 I am not old , but my young way was never the way to age .
 Enough of me .
 And of me , I am sure , said MrLorry .
 Are you going out .
 I'll walk with you to her gate .
 You know my vagabond and restless habits .
 If I should prowl about the streets a long time , don't be uneasy .
 I shall reappear in the morning .
 You go to the Court to-morrow .
 Yes , unhappily .
 I shall be there , but only as one of the crowd .
 My Spy will find a place for me .
 Take my arm , sir .
 It was ten o'clock at night when he stood before the prison of La Force , where she had stood hundreds of times .
 A little wood-sawyer , having closed his shop , was smoking his pipe at his shop-door .
 Good night , citizen , said Sydney Carton , pausing in going by .
 for , the man eyed him inquisitively .
 Good night , citizen .
 How goes the Republic .
 You mean the Guillotine .
 Not ill .
 Sixty-three to-day .
 We shall mount to a hundred soon .
 Samson and his men complain sometimes , of being exhausted .
 Ha , ha , ha .
 He is so droll , that Samson .
 Such a Barber .
 Shave .
 Always .
 Every day .
 What a barber .
 You have seen him at work .
 Never .
 Go and see him when he has a good batch .
 Figure this to yourself , citizen .
 he shaved the sixty-three to-day , in less than two pipes .
 Less than two pipes .
 Word of honour .
 You speak like a Frenchman .
 I am an old student here .
 Aha , a perfect Frenchman .
 Good night , Englishman .
 Good night , citizen .
 But go and see that droll dog , the little man persisted , calling after him .
 And take a pipe with you .
 For you , citizen .
 For me .
 You will be careful to keep them separate , citizen .
 You know the consequences of mixing them .
 Perfectly .
 Certain small packets were made and given to him .
 He put them , one by one , in the breast of his inner coat , counted out the money for them , and deliberately left the shop .
 There is nothing more to do , said he , glancing upward at the moon , until to-morrow .
 I can't sleep .
 With a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were going to rest , forgetful through a few calm hours of the horrors surrounding them .
 in the towers of the churches , where no prayers were said , for the popular revulsion had even travelled that length of self-destruction from years of priestly impostors , plunderers , and profligates .
 in the distant burial-places , reserved , as they wrote upon the gates , for Eternal Sleep .
 in the abounding gaols .
 and in the streets along which the sixties rolled to a death which had become so common and material , that no sorrowful story of a haunting Spirit ever arose among the people out of all the working of the Guillotine .
 with a solemn interest in the whole life and death of the city settling down to its short nightly pause in fury .
 Sydney Carton crossed the Seine again for the lighter streets .
 Now , that the streets were quiet , and the night wore on , the words were in the echoes of his feet , and were in the air .
 Perfectly calm and steady , he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked .
 but , he heard them always .
 Before that unjust Tribunal , there was little or no order of procedure , ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing .
 There could have been no such Revolution , if all laws , forms , and ceremonies , had not first been so monstrously abused , that the suicidal vengeance of the Revolution was to scatter them all to the winds .
 To this effect , in as few or fewer words , the Public Prosecutor .
 The President asked , was the Accused openly denounced or secretly .
 Openly , President .
 Three voices .
 Ernest Defarge , wine-vendor of StAntoine .
 Good .
 Therese Defarge , his wife .
 Good .
 President , I indignantly protest to you that this is a forgery and a fraud .
 You know the accused to be the husband of my daughter .
 My daughter , and those dear to her , are far dearer to me than my life .
 Who and where is the false conspirator who says that I denounce the husband of my child .
 Citizen Manette , be tranquil .
 To fail in submission to the authority of the Tribunal would be to put yourself out of Law .
 As to what is dearer to you than life , nothing can be so dear to a good citizen as the Republic .
 If the Republic should demand of you the sacrifice of your child herself , you would have no duty but to sacrifice her .
 Listen to what is to follow .
 In the meanwhile , be silent .
 You did good service at the taking of the Bastille , citizen .
 I believe so .
 It was The Vengeance who , amidst the warm commendations of the audience , thus assisted the proceedings .
 The President rang his bell .
 but , The Vengeance , warming with encouragement , shrieked , I defy that bell .
 wherein she was likewise much commended .
 Inform the Tribunal of what you did that day within the Bastille , citizen .
 Let it be read .
 I , Alexandre Manette , unfortunate physician , native of Beauvais , and afterwards resident in Paris , write this melancholy paper in my doleful cell in the Bastille , during the last month of the year , 1767 .
 I write it at stolen intervals , under every difficulty .
 I design to secrete it in the wall of the chimney , where I have slowly and laboriously made a place of concealment for it .
 Some pitying hand may find it there , when I and my sorrows are dust .
 The carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses , and the same voice called to me by my name .
 I answered .
 The carriage was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the door and alight before I came up with it .
 I am .
 Gentlemen , I returned , ëI am that Doctor Manette of whom you speak so graciously .
 The manner of both was imperious , and they both moved , as these words were spoken , so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door .
 They were armed .
 I was not .
 The reply to this was made by him who had spoken second .
 ëDoctor , your clients are people of condition .
 As to the nature of the case , our confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for yourself better than we can describe it .
 Enough .
 Will you please to enter the carriage .
 I could do nothing but comply , and I entered it in silence .
 They both entered after methe last springing in , after putting up the steps .
 The carriage turned about , and drove on at its former speed .
 I repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred .
 I have no doubt that it is , word for word , the same .
 I describe everything exactly as it took place , constraining my mind not to wander from the task .
 Where I make the broken marks that follow here , I leave off for the time , and put my paper in its hiding place .
 There was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention , for I had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs .
 But , the other of the two , being angry likewise , struck the man in like manner with his arm .
 the look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly alike , that I then first perceived them to be twin brothers .
 I saw this , within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient .
 for , in her restless strivings she had turned over on her face on the edge of the bed , had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth , and was in danger of suffocation .
 My first act was to put out my hand to relieve her breathing .
 and in moving the scarf aside , the embroidery in the corner caught my sight .
 To distinguish the brothers , I will call them the elder and the younger .
 by the elder , I mean him who exercised the most authority .
 It was the elder who replied , Since about this hour last night .
 She has a husband , a father , and a brother .
 A brother .
 I do not address her brother .
 He answered with great contempt , No .
 She has some recent association with the number twelve .
 The younger brother impatiently rejoined , With twelve o'clock .
 See , gentlemen , ' said I , still keeping my hands upon her breast , ëhow useless I am , as you have brought me .
 If I had known what I was coming to see , I could have come provided .
 As it is , time must be lost .
 There are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place .
 I opened some of the bottles , smelt them , and put the stoppers to my lips .
 If I had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that were poisons in themselves , I would not have administered any of those .
 Do you doubt them .
 asked the younger brother .
 You see , monsieur , I am going to use them , ' I replied , and said no more .
 There is another patient .
 On some hay on the ground , with a cushion thrown under his head , lay a handsome peasant boya boy of not more than seventeen at the most .
 He lay on his back , with his teeth set , his right hand clenched on his breast , and his glaring eyes looking straight upward .
 I could not see where his wound was , as I kneeled on one knee over him .
 but , I could see that he was dying of a wound from a sharp point .
 I am a doctor , my poor fellow , ' said I .
 Let me examine it .
 I do not want it examined , ' he answered .
 let it be .
 How has this been done , monsieur .
 said I .
 A crazed young common dog .
 A serf .
 Forced my brother to draw upon him , and has fallen by my brother's swordlike a gentleman .
 There was no touch of pity , sorrow , or kindred humanity , in this answer .
 The speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to have that different order of creature dying there , and that it would have been better if he had died in the usual obscure routine of his vermin kind .
 He was quite incapable of any compassionate feeling about the boy , or about his fate .
 Doctor , they are very proud , these Nobles .
 but we common dogs are proud too , sometimes .
 They plunder us , outrage us , beat us , kill us .
 but we have a little pride left , sometimes .
 She have you seen her , Doctor .
 The shrieks and the cries were audible there , though subdued by the distance .
 He referred to them , as if she were lying in our presence .
 I said , ëI have seen her .
 It was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily force to speak .
 but , his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis .
 The boy's eyes , which had been fixed on mine , slowly turned to the looker-on , and I saw in the two faces that all he said was true .
 The two opposing kinds of pride confronting one another , I can see , even in this Bastille .
 the gentleman's , all negligent indifference .
 the peasants , all trodden-down sentiment , and passionate revenge .
 Nothing human could have held life in the boy but his determination to tell all his wrong .
 He forced back the gathering shadows of death , as he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched , and to cover his wound .
 The room was darkening to his sight .
 the world was narrowing around him .
 I glanced about me , and saw that the hay and straw were trampled over the floor , as if there had been a struggle .
 She heard me , and ran in .
 I told her not to come near us till he was dead .
 He came in and first tossed me some pieces of money .
 then struck at me with a whip .
 But I , though a common dog , so struck at him as to make him draw .
 Let him break into as many pieces as he will , the sword that he stained with my common blood .
 he drew to defend himselfthrust at me with all his skill for his life .
 Now , lift me up , Doctor .
 lift me up .
 Where is he .
 Proud as these nobles are , he is afraid to see me .
 Where is the man who was here .
 Turn my face to him .
 When I returned to the bedside of the young woman , I found her raving in precisely the same order of continuity .
 I knew that this might last for many hours , and that it would probably end in the silence of the grave .
 Not dead , ' said I .
 but like to die .
 There is prodigious strength , ' I answered him , ëin sorrow and despair .
 I listened to the patient's breathing , and avoided answering .
 Do you honour me with your attention , Doctor .
 Monsieur , ' said I , ëin my profession , the communications of patients are always received in confidence .
 I was guarded in my answer , for I was troubled in my mind with what I had heard and seen .
 I write with so much difficulty , the cold is so severe , I am so fearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total darkness , that I must abridge this narrative .
 There is no confusion or failure in my memory .
 it can recall , and could detail , every word that was ever spoken between me and those brothers .
 She lingered for a week .
 Towards the last , I could understand some few syllables that she said to me , by placing my ear close to her lips .
 She asked me where she was , and I told her .
 who I was , and I told her .
 It was in vain that I asked her for her family name .
 She faintly shook her head upon the pillow , and kept her secret , as the boy had done .
 I had no opportunity of asking her any question , until I had told the brothers she was sinking fast , and could not live another day .
 Until then , though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save the woman and myself , one or other of them had always jealously sat behind the curtain at the head of the bed when I was there .
 But when it came to that , they seemed careless what communication I might hold with her .
 as ifthe thought passed through my mindI were dying too .
 The brothers were waiting in a room down-stairs , impatient to ride away .
 I had heard them , alone at the bedside , striking their boots with their riding-whips , and loitering up and down .
 At last she is dead .
 said the elder , when I went in .
 She is dead , ' said I .
 I congratulate you , my brother , ' were his words as he turned round .
 He had before offered me money , which I had postponed taking .
 He now gave me a rouleau of gold .
 I took it from his hand , but laid it on the table .
 I had considered the question , and had resolved to accept nothing .
 Pray excuse me , ' said I .
 Under the circumstances , no .
 I am weary , weary , wearyworn down by misery .
 I cannot read what I have written with this gaunt hand .
 I was much engaged that day , and could not complete my letter that night .
 I rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it .
 It was the last day of the year .
 The letter was lying before me just completed , when I was told that a lady waited , who wished to see me .
 My memory is still accurate , but I cannot write the words of our conversation .
 I suspect that I am watched more closely than I was , and I know not at what times I may be watched .
 She had in part suspected , and in part discovered , the main facts of the cruel story , of her husband's share in it , and my being resorted to .
 She did not know that the girl was dead .
 Her hope had been , she said in great distress , to show her , in secret , a woman's sympathy .
 Her hope had been to avert the wrath of Heaven from a House that had long been hateful to the suffering many .
 She had reasons for believing that there was a young sister living , and her greatest desire was , to help that sister .
 I could tell her nothing but that there was such a sister .
 beyond that , I knew nothing .
 Her inducement to come to me , relying on my confidence , had been the hope that I could tell her the name and place of abode .
 Whereas , to this wretched hour I am ignorant of both .
 These scraps of paper fail me .
 One was taken from me , with a warning , yesterday .
 I must finish my record to-day .
 She kissed the boy , and said , caressing him , ëIt is for thine own dear sake .
 Thou wilt be faithful , little Charles .
 The child answered her bravely , ëYes .
 I kissed her hand , and she took him in her arms , and went away caressing him .
 I never saw her more .
 If it had pleased GOD to put it in the hard heart of either of the brothers , in all these frightful years , to grant me any tidings of my dearest wifeso much as to let me know by a word whether alive or deadI might have thought that He had not quite abandoned them .
 But , now I believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them , and that they have no part in His mercies .
 And them and their descendants , to the last of their race , I , Alexandre Manette , unhappy prisoner , do this last night of the year 1767 , in my unbearable agony , denounce to the times when all these things shall be answered for .
 I denounce them to Heaven and to earth .
 Much influence around him , has that Doctor .
 murmured Madame Defarge , smiling to The Vengeance .
 Save him now , my Doctor , save him .
 If I might touch him .
 If I might embrace him once .
 O , good citizens , if you would have so much compassion for us .
 Farewell , dear darling of my soul .
 My parting blessing on my love .
 We shall meet again , where the weary are at rest .
 They were her husband's words , as he held her to his bosom .
 I send it to her by you .
 I kiss her by you .
 I say farewell to her by you .
 My husband .
 No .
 A moment .
 He was tearing himself apart from her .
 We shall not be separated long .
 I feel that this will break my heart by-and-bye .
 but I will do my duty while I can , and when I leave her , God will raise up friends for her , as He did for me .
 No , no .
 What have you done , what have you done , that you should kneel to us .
 We know now , what a struggle you made of old .
 We know , now what you underwent when you suspected my descent , and when you knew it .
 We know now , the natural antipathy you strove against , and conquered , for her dear sake .
 We thank you with all our hearts , and all our love and duty .
 Heaven be with you .
 Then , issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never moved , Sydney Carton came and took her up .
 Only her father and MrLorry were with her .
 His arm trembled as it raised her , and supported her head .
 Yet , there was an air about him that was not all of pitythat had a flush of pride in it .
 Shall I take her to a coach .
 I shall never feel her weight .
 He carried her lightly to the door , and laid her tenderly down in a coach .
 Her father and their old friend got into it , and he took his seat beside the driver .
 He bent over the child , and laid her blooming cheek against his face .
 He put her gently from him , and looked at her unconscious mother .
 Before I go , he said , and pausedI may kiss her .
 It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face with his lips , he murmured some words .
 The child , who was nearest to him , told them afterwards , and told her grandchildren when she was a handsome old lady , that she heard him say , A life you love .
 Try them again .
 The hours between this and to-morrow afternoon are few and short , but try .
 I intend to try .
 I will not rest a moment .
 Immediately after dark , I should hope .
 Within an hour or two from this .
 Yes .
 May you prosper .
 I have no hope , said MrLorry , in a low and sorrowful whisper .
 Nor have I .
 And so do I .
 I heard the fall of the axe in that sound .
 MrLorry leaned his arm upon the door-post , and bowed his face upon it .
 And walked with a settled step , down-stairs .
 Sydney Carton paused in the street , not quite decided where to go .
 At Tellson's banking-house at nine , he said , with a musing face .
 Shall I do well , in the mean time , to show myself .
 I think so .
 It is best that these people should know there is such a man as I here .
 it is a sound precaution , and may be a necessary preparation .
 But care , care , care .
 Let me think it out .
 He repeated what he had already said .
 asked Madame Defarge , inquisitively raising her dark eyebrows .
 Defarge brought him the wine , and gave him Good Evening .
 Good evening .
 Oh .
 Good evening , citizen , filling his glass .
 Ah .
 and good wine .
 I drink to the Republic .
 It is true what madame says , observed Jacques Three .
 Why stop .
 There is great force in that .
 Why stop .
 At extermination , said madame .
 Magnificent .
 croaked Jacques Three .
 The Vengeance , also , highly approved .
 I have observed his face .
 repeated madame , contemptuously and angrily .
 Yes .
 I have observed his face .
 I have observed his face to be not the face of a true friend of the Republic .
 Let him take care of his face .
 I have observed his daughter , repeated madame .
 yes , I have observed his daughter , more times than one .
 I have observed her to-day , and I have observed her other days .
 I have observed her in the court , and I have observed her in the street by the prison .
 Let me but lift my finger .
 She seemed to raise it the listener's eyes were always on his paper , and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her , as if the axe had dropped .
 The citizeness is superb .
 croaked the Juryman .
 As to thee , pursued madame , implacably , addressing her husband , if it depended on theewhich , happily , it does notthou wouldst rescue this man even now .
 No .
 protested Defarge .
 Not if to lift this glass would do it .
 But I would leave the matter there .
 I say , stop there .
 It is so , assented Defarge , without being asked .
 It is so , assented Defarge .
 It is so , assented Defarge again .
 It is so , assented Defarge once more .
 Then tell Wind and Fire where to stop , returned madame .
 but don't tell me .
 Both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature of her wraththe listener could feel how white she was , without seeing herand both highly commended it .
 Defarge , a weak minority , interposed a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the Marquis .
 but only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her last reply .
 Tell the Wind and the Fire where to stop .
 not me .
 They were discussing this question , and were almost building up some weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence , when they heard him on the stairs .
 The instant he entered the room , it was plain that all was lost .
 They looked at one another , and their hearts died within them .
 Come , come .
 said he , in a whimpering miserable way .
 let me get to work .
 Give me my work .
 Receiving no answer , he tore his hair , and beat his feet upon the ground , like a distracted child .
 Don't torture a poor forlorn wretch , he implored them , with a dreadful cry .
 but give me my work .
 What is to become of us , if those shoes are not done to-night .
 Lost , utterly lost .
 I do not doubt it , answered MrLorry .
 Say on .
 What is it .
 asked MrLorry , eagerly .
 MrLorry held it open in his hand , gazing in his earnest face .
 Why not .
 Yes .
 They are not in danger .
 Heaven grant I may , Carton .
 But how .
 So attentively , and with so much confidence in what you say , that for the moment I lose sight , touching the back of the Doctor's chair , even of this distress .
 It shall be done .
 His manner was so fervent and inspiring , that MrLorry caught the flame , and was as quick as youth .
 I am sure of it .
 I understand that I wait for you under all circumstances .
 You have my certificate in your hand with the rest , you know , and will reserve my place .
 Wait for nothing but to have my place occupied , and then for England .
 By the help of Heaven you shall .
 Promise me solemnly that nothing will influence you to alter the course on which we now stand pledged to one another .
 Nothing , Carton .
 I will remember them .
 I hope to do my part faithfully .
 And I hope to do mine .
 Now , good bye .
 Before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation , he had travelled thus far on his last way .
 Being allowed to purchase the means of writing , and a light , he sat down to write until such time as the prison lamps should be extinguished .
 To her father himself , he wrote in the same strain .
 but , he told her father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care .
 And he told him this , very strongly , with the hope of rousing him from any despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might be tending .
 He had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out .
 When he lay down on his straw bed , he thought he had done with this world .
 Twelve gone for ever .
 The key was put in the lock , and turned .
 Before the door was opened , or as it opened , a man said in a low voice , in English : He has never seen me here .
 I have kept out of his way .
 Go you in alone .
 I wait near .
 Lose no time .
 There was something so bright and remarkable in his look , that , for the first moment , the prisoner misdoubted him to be an apparition of his own imagining .
 But , he spoke , and it was his voice .
 he took the prisoner's hand , and it was his real grasp .
 Of all the people upon earth , you least expected to see me .
 he said .
 The prisoner wrung his hand .
 I bring you a request from her .
 What is it .
 The prisoner turned his face partly aside .
 Carton , there is no escaping from this place .
 it never can be done .
 You will only die with me .
 It is madness .
 With wonderful quickness , and with a strength both of will and action , that appeared quite supernatural , he forced all these changes upon him .
 The prisoner was like a young child in his hands .
 Do I ask you , my dear Darnay , to pass the door .
 When I ask that , refuse .
 There are pen and ink and paper on this table .
 Is your hand steady enough to write .
 It was when you came in .
 Steady it again , and write what I shall dictate .
 Quick , friend , quick .
 Write exactly as I speak .
 To whom do I address it .
 To no one .
 Carton still had his hand in his breast .
