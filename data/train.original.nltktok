 There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face , on the throne of England .
 there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face , on the throne of France .
 In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes , that things in general were settled for ever .
 It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five .
 Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period , as at this .
 MrsSouthcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth blessed birthday , of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster .
 Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years , after rapping out its messages , as the spirits of this very year last past supernaturally deficient in originality rapped out theirs .
 Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People , from a congress of British subjects in America : which , strange to relate , have proved more important to the human race than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane brood .
 With drooping heads and tremulous tails , they mashed their way through the thick mud , floundering and stumbling between whiles , as if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints .
 As often as the driver rested them and brought them to a stand , with a wary Wo-ho .
 the near leader violently shook his head and everything upon itlike an unusually emphatic horse , denying that the coach could be got up the hill .
 Whenever the leader made this rattle , the passenger started , as a nervous passenger might , and was disturbed in mind .
 There was a steaming mist in all the hollows , and it had roamed in its forlornness up the hill , like an evil spirit , seeking rest and finding none .
 A clammy and intensely cold mist , it made its slow way through the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another , as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do .
 It was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings , and a few yards of road .
 and the reek of the labouring horses steamed into it , as if they had made it all .
 Two other passengers , besides the one , were plodding up the hill by the side of the mail .
 All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the ears , and wore jack-boots .
 Not one of the three could have said , from anything he saw , what either of the other two was like .
 and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind , as from the eyes of the body , of his two companions .
 In those days , travellers were very shy of being confidential on a short notice , for anybody on the road might be a robber or in league with robbers .
 As to the latter , when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in the Captainës pay , ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable non-descript , it was the likeliest thing upon the cards .
 So the guard of the Dover mail thought to himself , that Friday night in November , one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five , lumbering up Shooter's Hill , as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail , beating his feet , and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him , where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols , deposited on a substratum of cutlass .
 Halloa .
 the guard replied .
 What o'clock do you make it , Joe .
 Ten minutes , good , past eleven .
 The emphatic horse , cut short by the whip in a most decided negative , made a decided scramble for it , and the three other horses followed suit .
 Once more , the Dover mail struggled on , with the jack-boots of its passengers squashing along by its side .
 They had stopped when the coach stopped , and they kept close company with it .
 If any one of the three had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead into the mist and darkness , he would have put himself in a fair way of getting shot instantly as a highwayman .
 What do you say , Tom .
 They both listened .
 I say a horse at a canter coming up , Joe .
 I say a horse at a gallop , Tom , returned the guard , leaving his hold of the door , and mounting nimbly to his place .
 Gentlemen .
 In the king's name , all of you .
 With this hurried adjuration , he cocked his blunderbuss , and stood on the offensive .
 The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring of the coach , added to the stillness of the night , made it very quiet indeed .
 The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to the coach , as if it were in a state of agitation .
 The hearts of the passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard .
 but at any rate , the quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath , and holding the breath , and having the pulses quickened by expectation .
 The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill .
 Never you mind what it is .
 the guard retorted .
 What are you .
 Is that the Dover mail .
 Why do you want to know .
 I want a passenger , if it is .
 What passenger .
 MrJarvis Lorry .
 Our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name .
 The guard , the coachman , and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully .
 What is the matter .
 asked the passenger , then , with mildly quavering speech .
 Who wants me .
 Is it Jerry .
 I don't like Jerry's voice , if it is Jerry , growled the guard to himself .
 He's hoarser than suits me , is Jerry .
 Yes , MrLorry .
 What is the matter .
 The figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist , and came to the side of the mail , where the passenger stood .
 The rider stooped , and , casting up his eyes at the guard , handed the passenger a small folded paper .
 The rider's horse was blown , and both horse and rider were covered with mud , from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of the man .
 Guard .
 said the passenger , in a tone of quiet business confidence .
 There is nothing to apprehend .
 I belong to Tellson's Bank .
 You must know Tellson's Bank in London .
 I am going to Paris on business .
 A crown to drink .
 I may read this .
 If so be as you're quick , sir .
 He opened it in the light of the coach-lamp on that side , and readfirst to himself and then aloud : ëWait at Dover for Mam'selle .
 It's not long , you see , guard .
 Jerry , say that my answer was , RECALLED TO LIFE .
 Jerry started in his saddle .
 That's a Blazing strange answer , too , said he , at his hoarsest .
 Take that message back , and they will know that I received this , as well as if I wrote .
 Make the best of your way .
 Good night .
 With those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in .
 not at all assisted by his fellow-passengers , who had expeditiously secreted their watches and purses in their boots , and were now making a general pretence of being asleep .
 With no more definite purpose than to escape the hazard of originating any other kind of action .
 Tom .
 softly over the coach roof .
 Hallo , Joe .
 Did you hear the message .
 I did , Joe .
 What did you make of it , Tom .
 Nothing at all , Joe .
 That's a coincidence , too , the guard mused , for I made the same of it myself .
 A wonderful fact to reflect upon , that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other .
 A solemn consideration , when I enter a great city by night , that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret .
 that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret .
 that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there , is , in some of its imaginings , a secret to the heart nearest it .
 Something of the awfulness , even of Death itself , is referable to this .
 No more can I turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved , and vainly hope in time to read it all .
 No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable water , wherein , as momentary lights glanced into it , I have had glimpses of buried treasure and other things submerged .
 It was appointed that the book should shut with a spring , for ever and for ever , when I had read but a page .
 It was appointed that the water should be locked in an eternal frost , when the light was playing on its surface , and I stood in ignorance on the shore .
 My friend is dead , my neighbour is dead , my love , the darling of my soul , is dead .
 it is the inexorable consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that individuality , and which I shall carry in mine to my life's end .
 In any of the burial-places of this city through which I pass , is there a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are , in their innermost personality , to me , or than I am to them .
 The messenger rode back at an easy trot , stopping pretty often at ale-houses by the way to drink , but evincing a tendency to keep his own counsel , and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes .
 He had eyes that assorted very well with that decoration , being of a surface black , with no depth in the colour or form , and much too near togetheras if they were afraid of being found out in something , singly , if they kept too far apart .
 They had a sinister expression , under an old cocked-hat like a three-cornered spittoon , and over a great muffler for the chin and throat , which descended nearly to the wearer's knees .
 When he stopped for drink , he moved this muffler with his left hand , only while he poured his liquor in with his right .
 as soon as that was done , he muffled again .
 His message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain , several times , to take off his hat to scratch his head .
 Except on the crown , which was raggedly bald , he had stiff , black hair , standing jaggedly all over it , and growing down hill almost to his broad , blunt nose .
 It was so like Smith's work , so much more like the top of a strongly spiked wall than a head of hair , that the best of players at leap-frog might have declined him , as the most dangerous man in the world to go over .
 What time , the mail-coach lumbered , jolted , rattled , and bumped upon its tedious way , with its three fellow-inscrutables inside .
 To whom , likewise , the shadows of the night revealed themselves , in the forms their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested .
 But , though the bank was almost always with him , and though the coach in a confused way , like the presence of pain under an opiate was always with him , there was another current of impression that never ceased to run , all through the night .
 He was on his way to dig some one out of a grave .
 Now , which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him was the true face of the buried person , the shadows of the night did not indicate .
 but they were all the faces of a man of five-and-forty by years , and they differed principally in the passions they expressed , and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state .
 Pride , contempt , defiance , stubbornness , submission , lamentation , succeeded one another .
 so did varieties of sunken cheek , cadaverous colour , emaciated hands and figures .
 But the face was in the main one face , and every head was prematurely white .
 A hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this spectre : 
.
 Buried how long .
 The answer was always the same : Almost eighteen years .
 You had abandoned all hope of being dug out .
 Long ago .
 You know that you are recalled to life .
 They tell me so .
 I hope you care to live .
 I can't say .
 Shall I show her to you .
 Will you come and see her .
 The answers to this question were various and contradictory .
 Sometimes the broken reply was , Wait .
 It would kill me if I saw her too soon .
 Sometimes , it was given in a tender rain of tears , and then it was , Take me to her .
 Sometimes it was staring and bewildered , and then it was , I don't know her .
 I don't understand .
 Yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain , on the moving patch of light from the lamps , and the hedge at the roadside retreating by jerks , the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train of the night shadows within .
 The real Banking-house by Temple Bar , the real business of the past day , the real strong rooms , the real express sent after him , and the real message returned , would all be there .
 Out of the midst of them , the ghostly face would rise , and he would accost it again .
 Buried how long .
 Almost eighteen years .
 I hope you care to live .
 I can't say .
 Buried how long .
 Almost eighteen years .
 You had abandoned all hope of being dug out .
 Long ago .
 The words were still in his hearing as just spokendistinctly in his hearing as ever spoken words had been in his lifewhen the weary passenger started to the consciousness of daylight , and found that the shadows of the night were gone .
 He lowered the window , and looked out at the rising sun .
 There was a ridge of ploughed land , with a plough upon it where it had been left last night when the horses were unyoked .
 beyond , a quiet coppice-wood , in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained upon the trees .
 Though the earth was cold and wet , the sky was clear , and the sun rose bright , placid , and beautiful .
 Eighteen years .
 said the passenger , looking at the sun .
 Gracious Creator of day .
 To be buried alive for eighteen years .
 When the mail got successfully to Dover , in the course of the forenoon , the head drawer at the Royal George Hotel opened the coach-door as his custom was .
 He did it with some flourish of ceremony , for a mail journey from London in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous traveller upon .
 There will be a packet to Calais , tomorrow , drawer .
 Yes , sir , if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair .
 The tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon , sir .
 Bed , sir .
 The coffee-room had no other occupant , that forenoon , than the gentleman in brown .
 His breakfast-table was drawn before the fire , and as he sat , with its light shining on him , waiting for the meal , he sat so still , that he might have been sitting for his portrait .
 Completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait , MrLorry dropped off to sleep .
 The arrival of his breakfast roused him , and he said to the drawer , as he moved his chair to it : 
.
 I wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any time to-day .
 She may ask for MrJarvis Lorry , or she may only ask for a gentleman from Tellson's Bank .
 Please to let me know .
 Yes , sir .
 Tellson's Bank in London , sir .
 Yes .
 Yes , sir .
 We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt London and Paris , sir .
 A vast deal of travelling , sir , in Tellson and Company's House .
 Yes .
 We are quite a French House , as well as an English one .
 Yes , sir .
 Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself , I think , sir .
 Not of late years .
 It is fifteen years since wesince Icame last from France .
 Indeed , sir .
 That was before my time here , sir .
 Before our people's time here , sir .
 The George was in other hands at that time , sir .
 I believe so .
 But I would hold a pretty wager , sir , that a House like Tellson and Company was flourishing , a matter of fifty , not to speak of fifteen years ago .
 You might treble that , and say a hundred and fifty , yet not be far from the truth .
 Indeed , sir .
 A bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no harm , otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work .
 MrLorry had been idle a long time , and had just poured out his last glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has got to the end of a bottle , when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow street , and rumbled into the inn-yard .
 He set down his glass untouched .
 This is Mam'selle .
 said he .
 In a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that Miss Manette had arrived from London , and would be happy to see the gentleman from Tellson's .
 So soon .
 The gentleman from Tellson's had nothing left for it but to empty his glass with an air of stolid desperation , settle his odd little flaxen wig at the ears , and follow the waiter to Miss Manette's apartment .
 It was a large , dark room , furnished in a funereal manner with black horsehair , and loaded with heavy dark tables .
 These had been oiled and oiled , until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room were gloomily reflected on every leaf .
 as if THEY were buried , in deep graves of black mahogany , and no light to speak of could be expected from them until they were dug out .
 I kiss your hand , miss , said MrLorry , with the manners of an earlier date , as he made his formal bow again , and took his seat .
 I received a letter from the Bank , sir , yesterday , informing me that some intelligenceor discovery
.
 rendered it necessary that I should go to Paris , there to communicate with a gentleman of the Bank , so good as to be despatched to Paris for the purpose .
 Myself .
 As I was prepared to hear , sir .
 She curtseyed to him young ladies made curtseys in those days , with a pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he was than she .
 He made her another bow .
 I was happy , said MrLorry , to be entrusted with the charge .
 I shall be more happy to execute it .
 Naturally , said MrLorry .
 After a pause , he added , again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the ears , It is very difficult to begin .
 Are you quite a stranger to me , sir .
 Am I not .
 MrLorry opened his hands , and extended them outwards with an argumentative smile .
 If you please , sir .
 Miss Manette , I am a man of business .
 I have a business charge to acquit myself of .
 In your reception of it , don't heed me any more than if I was a speaking machinetruly , I am not much else .
 I will , with your leave , relate to you , miss , the story of one of our customers .
 Story .
 Not of Beauvais .
 At that timeI may ask , at what time , sir .
 I speak , miss , of twenty years ago .
 He marriedan English ladyand I was one of the trustees .
 His affairs , like the affairs of many other French gentlemen and French families , were entirely in Tellson's hands .
 In a similar way I am , or I have been , trustee of one kind or other for scores of our customers .
 These are mere business relations , miss .
 there is no friendship in them , no particular interest , nothing like sentiment .
 I have passed from one to another , in the course of my business life , just as I pass from one of our customers to another in the course of my business day .
 in short , I have no feelings .
 I am a mere machine to go on .
 After this odd description of his daily routine of employment , MrLorry flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands which was most unnecessary , for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was before , and resumed his former attitude .
 So far , miss as you have remarked , this is the story of your regretted father .
 Now comes the difference .
 If your father had not died when he didDon't be frightened .
 How you start .
 Her look so discomposed him that he stopped , wandered , and began anew : 
 I entreat you to tell me more , sir .
 I will .
 I am going to .
 You can bear it .
 I can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this moment .
 The little child was a daughter , sir .
 For the truth .
 O dear , good , compassionate sir , for the truth .
 Aa matter of business .
 You confuse me , and how can I transact business if I am confused .
 Let us be clear-headed .
 If you could kindly mention now , for instance , what nine times ninepence are , or how many shillings in twenty guineas , it would be so encouraging .
 I should be so much more at my ease about your state of mind .
 He felt his wrist held closer , and he stopped .
 The expression in the forehead , which had so particularly attracted his notice , and which was now immovable , had deepened into one of pain and horror .
 A shiver ran through her frame , and from it through his .
 She said , in a low , distinct , awe-stricken voice , as if she were saying it in a dream , 
 I am going to see his Ghost .
 It will be his Ghostnot him .
 MrLorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm .
 There , there , there .
 See now , see now .
 The best and the worst are known to you , now .
 You are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman , and , with a fair sea voyage , and a fair land journey , you will be soon at his dear side .
 She repeated in the same tone , sunk to a whisper , I have been free , I have been happy , yet his Ghost has never haunted me .
 Perfectly still and silent , and not even fallen back in her chair , she sat under his hand , utterly insensible .
 with her eyes open and fixed upon him , and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or branded into her forehead .
 So close was her hold upon his arm , that he feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her .
 therefore he called out loudly for assistance without moving .
 I really think this must be a man .
 was MrLorry's breathless reflection , simultaneously with his coming against the wall .
 Why , look at you all .
 bawled this figure , addressing the inn servants .
 Why don't you go and fetch things , instead of standing there staring at me .
 I am not so much to look at , am I .
 Why don't you go and fetch things .
 I'll let you know , if you don't bring smelling-salts , cold water , and vinegar , quick , I will .
 I hope she will do well now , said MrLorry .
 No thanks to you in brown , if she does .
 My darling pretty .
 I hope , said MrLorry , after another pause of feeble sympathy and humility , that you accompany Miss Manette to France .
 A likely thing , too .
 replied the strong woman .
 If it was ever intended that I should go across salt water , do you suppose Providence would have cast my lot in an island .
 This being another question hard to answer , MrJarvis Lorry withdrew to consider it .
 A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken , in the street .
 The accident had happened in getting it out of a cart .
 the cask had tumbled out with a run , the hoops had burst , and it lay on the stones just outside the door of the wine-shop , shattered like a walnut-shell .
 The wine was red wine , and had stained the ground of the narrow street in the suburb of Saint Antoine , in Paris , where it was spilled .
 It had stained many hands , too , and many faces , and many naked feet , and many wooden shoes .
 The hands of the man who sawed the wood , left red marks on the billets .
 and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby , was stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again .
 Those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask , had acquired a tigerish smear about the mouth .
 and one tall joker so besmirched , his head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it , scrawled upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine-leesBLOOD .
 The time was to come , when that wine too would be spilled on the street-stones , and when the stain of it would be red upon many there .
 The fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance , as is often the way with his tribe .
 It missed its mark , and completely failed , as is often the way with his tribe too .
 What now .
 Are you a subject for the mad hospital .
 said the wine-shop keeper , crossing the road , and obliterating the jest with a handful of mud , picked up for the purpose , and smeared over it .
 Why do you write in the public streets .
 Is theretell me thouis there no other place to write such words in .
 In his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand perhaps accidentally , perhaps not upon the joker's heart .
 The joker rapped it with his own , took a nimble spring upward , and came down in a fantastic dancing attitude , with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his hand , and held out .
 A joker of an extremely , not to say wolfishly practical character , he looked , under those circumstances .
 The wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about , until they rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady , who were seated in a corner .
 Other company were there : two playing cards , two playing dominoes , three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply of wine .
 As he passed behind the counter , he took notice that the elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady , This is our man .
 What the devil YOU do in that galley there .
 said Monsieur Defarge to himself .
 I don't know you .
 But , he feigned not to notice the two strangers , and fell into discourse with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter .
 How goes it , Jacques .
 said one of these three to Monsieur Defarge .
 Is all the spilt wine swallowed .
 Every drop , Jacques , answered Monsieur Defarge .
 When this interchange of Christian name was effected , Madame Defarge , picking her teeth with her toothpick , coughed another grain of cough , and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line .
 It is not often , said the second of the three , addressing Monsieur Defarge , that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine , or of anything but black bread and death .
 Is it not so , Jacques .
 It is so , Jacques , Monsieur Defarge returned .
 At this second interchange of the Christian name , Madame Defarge , still using her toothpick with profound composure , coughed another grain of cough , and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line .
 Ah .
 So much the worse .
 A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle always have in their mouths , and hard lives they live , Jacques .
 Am I right , Jacques .
 You are right , Jacques , was the response of Monsieur Defarge .
 This third interchange of the Christian name was completed at the moment when Madame Defarge put her toothpick by , kept her eyebrows up , and slightly rustled in her seat .
 The three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge , with three flourishes .
 She acknowledged their homage by bending her head , and giving them a quick look .
 Then she glanced in a casual manner round the wine-shop , took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose of spirit , and became absorbed in it .
 Gentlemen , said her husband , who had kept his bright eye observantly upon her , good day .
 The chamber , furnished bachelor-fashion , that you wished to see , and were inquiring for when I stepped out , is on the fifth floor .
 The doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard close to the left here , pointing with his hand , near to the window of my establishment .
 But , now that I remember , one of you has already been there , and can show the way .
 Gentlemen , adieu .
 They paid for their wine , and left the place .
 The eyes of Monsieur Defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly gentleman advanced from his corner , and begged the favour of a word .
 Willingly , sir , said Monsieur Defarge , and quietly stepped with him to the door .
 Their conference was very short , but very decided .
 Almost at the first word , Monsieur Defarge started and became deeply attentive .
 It had not lasted a minute , when he nodded and went out .
 The gentleman then beckoned to the young lady , and they , too , went out .
 Madame Defarge knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows , and saw nothing .
 MrJarvis Lorry and Miss Manette , emerging from the wine-shop thus , joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own company just before .
 It opened from a stinking little black courtyard , and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses , inhabited by a great number of people .
 In the gloomy tile-paved entry to the gloomy tile-paved staircase , Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee to the child of his old master , and put her hand to his lips .
 It was a gentle action , but not at all gently done .
 a very remarkable transformation had come over him in a few seconds .
 He had no good-humour in his face , nor any openness of aspect left , but had become a secret , angry , dangerous man .
 Is he alone .
 the latter whispered .
 Alone .
 God help him , who should be with him .
 said the other , in the same low voice .
 Is he always alone , then .
 Yes .
 Of his own desire .
 Of his own necessity .
 As he was , when I first saw him after they found me and demanded to know if I would take him , and , at my peril be discreetas he was then , so he is now .
 He is greatly changed .
 Changed .
 The keeper of the wine-shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand , and mutter a tremendous curse .
 No direct answer could have been half so forcible .
 MrLorry's spirits grew heavier and heavier , as he and his two companions ascended higher and higher .
 Such a staircase , with its accessories , in the older and more crowded parts of Paris , would be bad enough now .
 but , at that time , it was vile indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses .
 Every little habitation within the great foul nest of one high buildingthat is to say , the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general staircaseleft its own heap of refuse on its own landing , besides flinging other refuse from its own windows .
 The uncontrollable and hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered , would have polluted the air , even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their intangible impurities .
 the two bad sources combined made it almost insupportable .
 Through such an atmosphere , by a steep dark shaft of dirt and poison , the way lay .
 Yielding to his own disturbance of mind , and to his young companion's agitation , which became greater every instant , MrJarvis Lorry twice stopped to rest .
 Each of these stoppages was made at a doleful grating , by which any languishing good airs that were left uncorrupted , seemed to escape , and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed to crawl in .
 Through the rusted bars , tastes , rather than glimpses , were caught of the jumbled neighbourhood .
 and nothing within range , nearer or lower than the summits of the two great towers of Notre-Dame , had any promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations .
 The door is locked then , my friend .
 said MrLorry , surprised .
 You think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired .
 Why .
 Because he has lived so long , locked up , that he would be frightenedravetear himself to piecesdiecome to I know not what harmif his door was left open .
 Is it possible .
 exclaimed MrLorry .
 Courage , dear miss .
 Courage .
 Business .
 The worst will be over in a moment .
 it is but passing the room-door , and the worst is over .
 Then , all the good you bring to him , all the relief , all the happiness you bring to him , begin .
 Let our good friend here , assist you on that side .
 That's well , friend Defarge .
 Come , now .
 Business , business .
 I forgot them in the surprise of your visit , explained Monsieur Defarge .
 Leave us , good boys .
 we have business here .
 The three glided by , and went silently down .
 There appearing to be no other door on that floor , and the keeper of the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone , MrLorry asked him in a whisper , with a little anger : 
.
 Do you make a show of Monsieur Manette .
 I show him , in the way you have seen , to a chosen few .
 Is that well .
 I think it is well .
 Who are the few .
 How do you choose them .
 With an admonitory gesture to keep them back , he stooped , and looked in through the crevice in the wall .
 Soon raising his head again , he struck twice or thrice upon the doorevidently with no other object than to make a noise there .
 With the same intention , he drew the key across it , three or four times , before he put it clumsily into the lock , and turned it as heavily as he could .
 The door slowly opened inward under his hand , and he looked into the room and said something .
 A faint voice answered something .
 Little more than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side .
 A-a-a-business , business .
 he urged , with a moisture that was not of business shining on his cheek .
 Come in , come in .
 I am afraid of it , she answered , shuddering .
 Of it .
 What .
 I mean of him .
 Of my father .
 Rendered in a manner desperate , by her state and by the beckoning of their conductor , he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his shoulder , lifted her a little , and hurried her into the room .
 He sat her down just within the door , and held her , clinging to him .
 Defarge drew out the key , closed the door , locked it on the inside , took out the key again , and held it in his hand .
 All this he did , methodically , and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he could make .
 Finally , he walked across the room with a measured tread to where the window was .
 He stopped there , and faced round .
 Good day .
 said Monsieur Defarge , looking down at the white head that bent low over the shoemaking .
 It was raised for a moment , and a very faint voice responded to the salutation , as if it were at a distance : 
 Good day .
 You are still hard at work , I see .
 The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful .
 It was not the faintness of physical weakness , though confinement and hard fare no doubt had their part in it .
 Its deplorable peculiarity was , that it was the faintness of solitude and disuse .
 It was like the last feeble echo of a sound made long and long ago .
 So entirely had it lost the life and resonance of the human voice , that it affected the senses like a once beautiful color faded away into a poor weak stain .
 So sunken and suppressed it was , that it was like a voice underground .
 So expressive it was , of a hopeless and lost creature , that a famished traveler , wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness , would have remembered home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die .
 I want , said Defarge , who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker , to let in a little more light here .
 You can bear a little more .
 What did you say .
 You can bear a little more light .
 The opened half-door was opened a little further , and secured at that angle for the time .
 A broad ray of light fell into the garret , and showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap , pausing in his labour .
 His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his feet and on his bench .
 He had a white beard , raggedly cut , but not very long , a hollow face , and exceedingly bright eyes .
 The hollowness and thinness of his face would have caused them to look large , under his yet dark eyebrows and his confused white hair , though they had been really otherwise .
 but , they were naturally large , and looked unnaturally so .
 His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat , and showed his body to be withered and worn .
 He , and his old canvas frock , and his loose stockings , and all his poor tatters of clothes , had , in a long seclusion from direct light and air , faded down to such a dull uniformity of parchment-yellow , that it would have been hard to say which was which .
 He had put up a hand between his eyes and the light , and the very bones of it seemed transparent .
 So he sat , with a steadfastly vacant gaze , pausing in his work .
 He never looked at the figure before him , without first looking down on this side of himself , then on that , as if he had lost the habit of associating place with sound .
 he never spoke , without first wandering in this manner , and forgetting to speak .
 Are you going to finish that pair of shoes to-day .
 asked Defarge , motioning to MrLorry to come forward .
 What did you say .
 Do you mean to finish that pair of shoes to-day .
 I can't say that I mean to .
 I suppose so .
 I don't know .
 But , the question reminded him of his work , and he bent over it again .
 You have a visitor , you see , said Monsieur Defarge .
 What did you say .
 Here is a visitor .
 The shoemaker looked up as before , but without removing a hand from his work .
 Come .
 said Defarge .
 Here is monsieur , who knows a well-made shoe when he sees one .
 Show him that shoe you are working at .
 Take it , monsieur .
 MrLorry took it in his hand .
 Tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is , and the maker's name .
 There was a longer pause than usual , before the shoemaker replied : 
 I forget what it was you asked me .
 What did you say .
 I said , couldn't you describe the kind of shoe , for monsieur's information .
 And the maker's name .
 said Defarge .
 Did you ask me for my name .
 Assuredly I did .
 One Hundred and Five , North Tower .
 Is that all .
 One Hundred and Five , North Tower .
 With a weary sound that was not a sigh , nor a groan , he bent to work again , until the silence was again broken .
 You are not a shoemaker by trade .
 said MrLorry , looking steadfastly at him .
 I am not a shoemaker by trade .
 No , I was not a shoemaker by trade .
 I-I learnt it here .
 I taught myself .
 I asked leave to .
 He lapsed away , even for minutes , ringing those measured changes on his hands the whole time .
 His eyes came slowly back , at last , to the face from which they had wandered .
 when they rested on it , he started , and resumed , in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake , reverting to a subject of last night .
 The shoe dropped to the ground , and he sat looking fixedly at the questioner .
 Darkness had fatten on him in its place .
 He looked at the two , less and less attentively , and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground and looked about him in the old way .
 Finally , with a deep long sigh , he took the shoe up , and resumed his work .
 Have you recognised him , monsieur .
 asked Defarge in a whisper .
 She had moved from the wall of the garret , very near to the bench on which he sat .
 There was something awful in his unconsciousness of the figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped over his labour .
 It happened , at length , that he had occasion to change the instrument in his hand , for his shoemaker's knife .
 It lay on that side of him which was not the side on which she stood .
 He had taken it up , and was stooping to work again , when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress .
 He raised them , and saw her face .
 The two spectators started forward , but she stayed them with a motion of her hand .
 She had no fear of his striking at her with the knife , though they had .
 What is this .
 With the tears streaming down her face , she put her two hands to her lips , and kissed them to him .
 then clasped them on her breast , as if she laid his ruined head there .
 You are not the gaoler's daughter .
 She sighed No .
 Who are you .
 Not yet trusting the tones of her voice , she sat down on the bench beside him .
 He recoiled , but she laid her hand upon his arm .
 A strange thrill struck him when she did so , and visibly passed over his frame .
 he laid the knife down' softly , as he sat staring at her .
 Her golden hair , which she wore in long curls , had been hurriedly pushed aside , and fell down over her neck .
 Advancing his hand by little and little , he took it up and looked at it .
 In the midst of the action he went astray , and , with another deep sigh , fell to work at his shoemaking .
 He took her hair into his hand again , and looked closely at it .
 It is the same .
 How can it be .
 When was it .
 How was it .
 As the concentrated expression returned to his forehead , he seemed to become conscious that it was in hers too .
 He turned her full to the light , and looked at her .
 He formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it .
 But when he did find spoken words for it , they came to him coherently , though slowly .
 How was this .
 WAS IT YOU .
 Hark .
 he exclaimed .
 Whose voice was that .
 No , no , no .
 you are too young , too blooming .
 It can't be .
 See what the prisoner is .
 These are not the hands she knew , this is not the face she knew , this is not a voice she ever heard .
 No , no .
 She wasand He wasbefore the slow years of the North Towerages ago .
 What is your name , my gentle angel .
 Hailing his softened tone and manner , his daughter fell upon her knees before him , with her appealing hands upon his breast .
 His cold white head mingled with her radiant hair , which warmed and lighted it as though it were the light of Freedom shining on him .
 If you hear in my voiceI don't know that it is so , but I hope it isif you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was sweet music in your ears , weep for it , weep for it .
 If you touch , in touching my hair , anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your breast when you were young and free , weep for it , weep for it .
 If , when I hint to you of a Home that is before us , where I will be true to you with all my duty and with all my faithful service , I bring back the remembrance of a Home long desolate , while your poor heart pined away , weep for it , weep for it .
 She held him closer round the neck , and rocked him on her breast like a child .
 If , when I tell you , dearest dear , that your agony is over , and that I have come here to take you from it , and that we go to England to be at peace and at rest , I cause you to think of your useful life laid waste , and of our native France so wicked to you , weep for it , weep for it .
 And if , when I shall tell you of my name , and of my father who is living , and of my mother who is dead , you learn that I have to kneel to my honoured father , and implore his pardon for having never for his sake striven all day and lain awake and wept all night , because the love of my poor mother hid his torture from me , weep for it , weep for it .
 Weep for her , then , and for me .
 Good gentlemen , thank God .
 I feel his sacred tears upon my face , and his sobs strike against my heart .
 O , see .
 Thank God for us , thank God .
 More fit for that , I think , than to remain in this city , so dreadful to him .
 That's business , said MrLorry , resuming on the shortest notice his methodical manners .
 and if business is to be done , I had better do it .
 Then , as the darkness closed in , the daughter laid her head down on the hard ground close at the father's side , and watched him .
 The darkness deepened and deepened , and they both lay quiet , until a light gleamed through the chinks in the wall .
 In the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion , he ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink , and put on the cloak and other wrappings , that they gave him to wear .
 He readily responded to his daughter's drawing her arm through his , and tookand kepther hand in both his own .
 You remember the place , my father .
 You remember coming up here .
 What did you say .
 But , before she could repeat the question , he murmured an answer as if she had repeated it .
 Remember .
 No , I don't remember .
 It was so very long ago .
 Defarge got upon the box , and gave the word To the Barrier .
 The postilion cracked his whip , and they clattered away under the feeble over-swinging lamps .
 I hope you care to be recalled to life .
 And the old answer : 
 I can't say .
 The end of the first book .
 Tellson's Bank by Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place , even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty .
 It was very small , very dark , very ugly , very incommodious .
 It was an old-fashioned place , moreover , in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were proud of its smallness , proud of its darkness , proud of its ugliness , proud of its incommodiousness .
 They were even boastful of its eminence in those particulars , and were fired by an express conviction that , if it were less objectionable , it would be less respectable .
 This was no passive belief , but an active weapon which they flashed at more convenient places of business .
 Tellson's they said wanted no elbow-room , Tellson's wanted no light , Tellson's wanted no embellishment .
 Noakes and Co .
 's might , or Snooks Brothers' might .
 but Tellson's , thank Heaven .
 Any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the question of rebuilding Tellson's .
 In this respect the House was much on a par with the Country .
 which did very often disinherit its sons for suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly objectionable , but were only the more respectable .
 Cramped in all kinds of dun cupboards and hutches at Tellson's , the oldest of men carried on the business gravely .
 When they took a young man into Tellson's London house , they hid him somewhere till he was old .
 They kept him in a dark place , like a cheese , until he had the full Tellson flavour and blue-mould upon him .
 Then only was he permitted to be seen , spectacularly poring over large books , and casting his breeches and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment .
 MrCruncher's apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood , and were but two in number , even if a closet with a single pane of glass in it might be counted as one .
 But they were very decently kept .
 Early as it was , on the windy March morning , the room in which he lay abed was already scrubbed throughout .
 and between the cups and saucers arranged for breakfast , and the lumbering deal table , a very clean white cloth was spread .
 MrCruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane , like a Harlequin at home .
 At fast , he slept heavily , but , by degrees , began to roll and surge in bed , until he rose above the surface , with his spiky hair looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons .
 At which juncture , he exclaimed , in a voice of dire exasperation : 
 Bust me , if she ain't at it agin .
 A woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her knees in a corner , with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she was the person referred to .
 What .
 said MrCruncher , looking out of bed for a boot .
 You're at it agin , are you .
 I was only saying my prayers .
 Saying your prayers .
 You're a nice woman .
 What do you mean by flopping yourself down and praying agin me .
 I was not praying against you .
 I was praying for you .
 They only come from the heart , Jerry .
 They are worth no more than that .
 Growling , in addition , such phrases as Ah .
 yes .
 You're religious , too .
 You wouldn't put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband and child , would you .
 Not you .
 and throwing off other sarcastic sparks from the whirling grindstone of his indignation , MrCruncher betook himself to his boot-cleaning and his general preparation for business .
 In the meantime , his son , whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes , and whose young eyes stood close by one another , as his father's did , kept the required watch upon his mother .
 He greatly disturbed that poor woman at intervals , by darting out of his sleeping closet , where he made his toilet , with a suppressed cry of You are going to flop , mother .
 Halloa , father .
 and , after raising this fictitious alarm , darting in again with an undutiful grin .
 MrCruncher's temper was not at all improved when he came to his breakfast .
 He resented MrsCruncher's saying grace with particular animosity .
 His wife explained that she had merely asked a blessing .
 Don't do it .
 said MrCruncher looking about , as if he rather expected to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his wife's petitions .
 I ain't a going to be blest out of house and home .
 I won't have my wittles blest off my table .
 Keep still .
 Exceedingly red-eyed and grim , as if he had been up all night at a party which had taken anything but a convivial turn , Jerry Cruncher worried his breakfast rather than ate it , growling over it like any four-footed inmate of a menagerie .
 Towards nine o'clock he smoothed his ruffled aspect , and , presenting as respectable and business-like an exterior as he could overlay his natural self with , issued forth to the occupation of the day .
 The head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to Tellson's establishment was put through the door , and the word was given : 
 Porter wanted .
 Hooray , father .
 Here's an early job to begin with .
 Having thus given his parent God speed , young Jerry seated himself on the stool , entered on his reversionary interest in the straw his father had been chewing , and cogitated .
 You know the Old Bailey , well , no doubt .
 said one of the oldest of clerks to Jerry the messenger .
 Ye-es , sir , returned Jerry , in something of a dogged manner .
 I DO know the Bailey .
 Just so .
 And you know MrLorry .
 Very well .
 Find the door where the witnesses go in , and show the door-keeper this note for MrLorry .
 He will then let you in .
 Into the court , sir .
 MrCruncher's eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another , and to interchange the inquiry , What do you think of this .
 Am I to wait in the court , sir .
 he asked , as the result of that conference .
 Is that all , sir .
 That's all .
 He wishes to have a messenger at hand .
 This is to tell him you are there .
 I suppose they'll be trying Forgeries this morning .
 That's quartering , said Jerry .
 Barbarous .
 It is the law , remarked the ancient clerk , turning his surprised spectacles upon him .
 It is the law .
 It's hard in the law to spile a man , I think .
 Ifs hard enough to kill him , but it's wery hard to spile him , sir .
 It's the damp , sir , what settles on my chest and voice , said Jerry .
 I leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is .
 After some delay and demur , the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a very little way , and allowed MrJerry Cruncher to squeeze himself into court .
 What's on .
 he asked , in a whisper , of the man he found himself next to .
 Nothing yet .
 What's coming on .
 The Treason case .
 The quartering one , eh .
 If he's found Guilty , you mean to say .
 Jerry added , by way of proviso .
 What's HE got to do with the case .
 asked the man he had spoken with .
 Blest if I know , said Jerry .
 What have YOU got to do with it , then , if a person may inquire .
 Blest if I know that either , said Jerry .
 Over the prisoner's head there was a mirror , to throw the light down upon him .
 Crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in it , and had passed from its surface and this earth's together .
 Haunted in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been , if the glass could ever have rendered back its reflections , as the ocean is one day to give up its dead .
 Some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace for which it had been reserved , may have struck the prisoner's mind .
 Be that as it may , a change in his position making him conscious of a bar of light across his face , he looked up .
 and when he saw the glass his face flushed , and his right hand pushed the herbs away .
 It happened , that the action turned his face to that side of the court which was on his left .
 About on a level with his eyes , there sat , in that corner of the Judge's bench , two persons upon whom his look immediately rested .
 so immediately , and so much to the changing of his aspect , that all the eyes that were tamed upon him , turned to them .
 The spectators saw in the two figures , a young lady of little more than twenty , and a gentleman who was evidently her father .
 a man of a very remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair , and a certain indescribable intensity of face : not of an active kind , but pondering and self-communing .
 When this expression was upon him , he looked as if he were old .
 but when it was stirred and broken up--as it was now , in a moment , on his speaking to his daughter--he became a handsome man , not past the prime of life .
 His daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm , as she sat by him , and the other pressed upon it .
 She had drawn close to him , in her dread of the scene , and in her pity for the prisoner .
 Her forehead had been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion that saw nothing but the peril of the accused .
 This had been so very noticeable , so very powerfully and naturally shown , that starers who had had no pity for him were touched by her .
 and the whisper went about , Who are they .
 Jerry , the messenger , who had made his own observations , in his own manner , and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in his absorption , stretched his neck to hear who they were .
 The crowd about him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant , and from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back .
 at last it got to Jerry : 
 Witnesses .
 Against .
 Against what side .
 The prisoner's .
 When the Attorney-General ceased , a buzz arose in the court as if a cloud of great blue-flies were swarming about the prisoner , in anticipation of what he was soon to become .
 When toned down again , the unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness-box .
 Had he ever been a spy himself .
 No , he scorned the base insinuation .
 What did he live upon .
 His property .
 Where was his property .
 He didn't precisely remember where it was .
 What was it .
 No business of anybody's .
 Had he inherited it .
 Yes , he had .
 From whom .
 Distant relation .
 Very distant .
 Rather .
 Ever been in prison .
 Certainly not .
 Never in a debtors' prison .
 Didn't see what that had to do with it .
 Never in a debtors' prison .
 Come , once again .
 Never .
 Yes .
 How many times .
 Two or three times .
 Not five or six .
 Perhaps .
 Of what profession .
 Gentleman .
 Ever been kicked .
 Might have been .
 Frequently .
 No .
 Ever kicked downstairs .
 Decidedly not .
 once received a kick on the top of a staircase , and fell downstairs of his own accord .
 Kicked on that occasion for cheating at dice .
 Something to that effect was said by the intoxicated liar who committed the assault , but it was not true .
 Swear it was not true .
 Positively .
 Ever live by cheating at play .
 Never .
 Ever live by play .
 Not more than other gentlemen do .
 Ever borrow money of the prisoner .
 Yes .
 Ever pay him .
 No .
 Was not this intimacy with the prisoner , in reality a very slight one , forced upon the prisoner in coaches , inns , and packets .
 No .
 Sure he saw the prisoner with these lists .
 Certain .
 Knew no more about the lists .
 No .
 Had not procured them himself , for instance .
 No .
 Expect to get anything by this evidence .
 No .
 Not in regular government pay and employment , to lay traps .
 Oh dear no .
 Or to do anything .
 Oh dear no .
 Swear that .
 Over and over again .
 No motives but motives of sheer patriotism .
 None whatever .
 The blue-flies buzzed again , and MrAttorney-General called MrJarvis Lorry .
 MrJarvis Lorry , are you a clerk in Tellson's bank .
 I am .
 On a certain Friday night in November one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five , did business occasion you to travel between London and Dover by the mail .
 It did .
 Were there any other passengers in the mail .
 Two .
 Did they alight on the road in the course of the night .
 They did .
 MrLorry , look upon the prisoner .
 Was he one of those two passengers .
 I cannot undertake to say that he was .
 Does he resemble either of these two passengers .
 Both were so wrapped up , and the night was so dark , and we were all so reserved , that I cannot undertake to say even that .
 MrLorry , look again upon the prisoner .
 Supposing him wrapped up as those two passengers were , is there anything in his bulk and stature to render it unlikely that he was one of them .
 No .
 You will not swear , MrLorry , that he was not one of them .
 No .
 So at least you say he may have been one of them .
 Yes .
 Except that I remember them both to have beenlike myselftimorous of highwaymen , and the prisoner has not a timorous air .
 Did you ever see a counterfeit of timidity , MrLorry .
 I certainly have seen that .
 MrLorry , look once more upon the prisoner .
 Have you seen him , to your certain knowledge , before .
 I have .
 When .
 At what hour did he come on board .
 At a little after midnight .
 In the dead of the night .
 Was he the only passenger who came on board at that untimely hour .
 Never mind about ëhappening , ' MrLorry .
 He was the only passenger who came on board in the dead of the night .
 He was .
 Were you travelling alone , MrLorry , or with any companion .
 With two companions .
 A gentleman and lady .
 They are here .
 They are here .
 Had you any conversation with the prisoner .
 The young lady , to whom all eyes had been turned before , and were now turned again , stood up where she had sat .
 Her father rose with her , and kept her hand drawn through his arm .
 Miss Manette , look upon the prisoner .
 To be confronted with such pity , and such earnest youth and beauty , was far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the crowd .
 Standing , as it were , apart with her on the edge of his grave , not all the staring curiosity that looked on , could , for the moment , nerve him to remain quite still .
 His hurried right hand parcelled out the herbs before him into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden .
 and his efforts to control and steady his breathing shook the lips from which the colour rushed to his heart .
 The buzz of the great flies was loud again .
 Miss Manette , have you seen the prisoner before .
 Yes , sir .
 Where .
 You are the young lady just now referred to .
 O .
 most unhappily , I am .
 Miss Manette , had you any conversation with the prisoner on that passage across the Channel .
 Yes , sir .
 Recall it .
 In the midst of a profound stillness , she faintly began : When the gentleman came on board .
 Do you mean the prisoner .
 inquired the Judge , knitting his brows .
 Yes , my Lord .
 Then say the prisoner .
 Let me interrupt you for a moment .
 Had he come on board alone .
 No .
 How many were with him .
 Two French gentlemen .
 Had they conferred together .
 They had conferred together until the last moment , when it was necessary for the French gentlemen to be landed in their boat .
 Some papers had been handed about among them , but I don't know what papers .
 Like these in shape and size .
 Now , to the prisoner's conversation , Miss Manette .
 Buzzing from the blue-flies .
 Did he say anything about America , Miss Manette .
 Be particular .
 Any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor in a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed , will be unconsciously imitated by the spectators .
 Her forehead was painfully anxious and intent as she gave this evidence , and , in the pauses when she stopped for the Judge to write it down , watched its effect upon the counsel for and against .
 Among the lookers-on there was the same expression in all quarters of the court .
 insomuch , that a great majority of the foreheads there , might have been mirrors reflecting the witness , when the Judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous heresy about George Washington .
 Can you identify him as your fellow-passenger on board the packet , or speak to his conversation with your daughter .
 Sir , I can do neither .
 Is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do either .
 He answered , in a low voice , There is .
 He answered , in a tone that went to every heart , A long imprisonment .
 Were you newly released on the occasion in question .
 They tell me so .
 Have you no remembrance of the occasion .
 None .
 My mind is a blank , from some timeI cannot even say what timewhen I employed myself , in my captivity , in making shoes , to the time when I found myself living in London with my dear daughter here .
 She had become familiar to me , when a gracious God restored my faculties .
 but , I am quite unable even to say how she had become familiar .
 I have no remembrance of the process .
 The witness was quite sure .
 Did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner .
 Not so like the witness said as that he could be mistaken .
 Look well upon that gentleman , my learned friend there , pointing to him who had tossed the paper over , and then look well upon the prisoner .
 How say you .
 Are they very like each other .
 Yet , this MrCarton took in more of the details of the scene than he appeared to take in .
 for now , when Miss Manette's head dropped upon her father's breast , he was the first to see it , and to say audibly : Officer .
 look to that young lady .
 Help the gentleman to take her out .
 Don't you see she will fall .
 There was much commiseration for her as she was removed , and much sympathy with her father .
 It had evidently been a great distress to him , to have the days of his imprisonment recalled .
 He had shown strong internal agitation when he was questioned , and that pondering or brooding look which made him old , had been upon him , like a heavy cloud , ever since .
 As he passed out , the jury , who had turned back and paused a moment , spoke , through their foreman .
 Jerry , if you wish to take something to eat , you can .
 But , keep in the way .
 You will be sure to hear when the jury come in .
 Don't be a moment behind them , for I want you to take the verdict back to the bank .
 You are the quickest messenger I know , and will get to Temple Bar long before I can .
 Jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle , and he knuckled it in acknowledgment of this communication and a shilling .
 MrCarton came up at the moment , and touched MrLorry on the arm .
 How is the young lady .
 She is greatly distressed .
 but her father is comforting her , and she feels the better for being out of court .
 I'll tell the prisoner so .
 It won't do for a respectable bank gentleman like you , to be seen speaking to him publicly , you know .
 The prisoner came forward directly .
 You will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness , Miss Manette .
 She will do very well .
 You have seen the worst of her agitation .
 I am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it .
 Could you tell her so for me , with my fervent acknowledgments .
 MrCarton's manner was so careless as to be almost insolent .
 He stood , half turned from the prisoner , lounging with his elbow against the bar .
 I do ask it .
 Accept my cordial thanks .
 The worst .
 It's the wisest thing to expect , and the likeliest .
 But I think their withdrawing is in your favour .
 MrLorry was already calling at the door when he got there .
 Here , sir .
 It's a fight to get back again .
 Here I am , sir .
 MrLorry handed him a paper through the throng .
 Quick .
 Have you got it .
 Yes , sir .
 Hastily written on the paper was the word ACQUITTED .
 If you had sent the message , Recalled to Life , ' again , muttered Jerry , as he turned , I should have known what you meant , this time .
 He had no opportunity of saying , or so much as thinking , anything else , until he was clear of the Old Bailey .
 for , the crowd came pouring out with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs , and a loud buzz swept into the street as if the baffled blue-flies were dispersing in search of other carrion .
 Only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from his mind .
 She was the golden thread that united him to a Past beyond his misery , and to a Present beyond his misery : and the sound of her voice , the light of her face , the touch of her hand , had a strong beneficial influence with him almost always .
 Not absolutely always , for she could recall some occasions on which her power had failed .
 but they were few and slight , and she believed them over .
 He still had his wig and gown on , and he said , squaring himself at his late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent MrLorry clean out of the group : I am glad to have brought you off with honour , MrDarnay .
 It was an infamous prosecution , grossly infamous .
 but not the less likely to succeed on that account .
 You have laid me under an obligation to you for lifein two senses , said his late client , taking his hand .
 You think so .
 said MrStryver .
 Well .
 you have been present all day , and you ought to know .
 You are a man of business , too .
 Speak for yourself , MrLorry , said Stryver .
 I have a night's work to do yet .
 Speak for yourself .
 He slowly shook the shadow off , and turned to her .
 Shall we go home , my father .
 With a long breath , he answered Yes .
 Nobody had made any acknowledgment of MrCarton's part in the day's proceedings .
 nobody had known of it .
 He was unrobed , and was none the better for it in appearance .
 If you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind , when the business mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business appearances , you would be amused , MrDarnay .
 MrLorry reddened , and said , warmly , You have mentioned that before , sir .
 We men of business , who serve a House , are not our own masters .
 We have to think of the House more than ourselves .
 Business .
 Bless you , I have no business , said MrCarton .
 It is a pity you have not , sir .
 I think so , too .
 If you had , pursued MrLorry , perhaps you would attend to it .
 Perhaps a little angry with himself , as well as with the barrister , MrLorry bustled into the chair , and was carried off to Tellson's .
 Carton , who smelt of port wine , and did not appear to be quite sober , laughed then , and turned to Darnay : 
 This is a strange chance that throws you and me together .
 This must be a strange night to you , standing alone here with your counterpart on these street stones .
 I hardly seem yet , returned Charles Darnay , to belong to this world again .
 I don't wonder at it .
 it's not so long since you were pretty far advanced on your way to another .
 You speak faintly .
 I begin to think I AM faint .
 Then why the devil don't you dine .
 I dined , myself , while those numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong tothis , or some other .
 Let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at .
 Do you feel , yet , that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again , MrDarnay .
 It must be an immense satisfaction .
 He said it bitterly , and filled up his glass again : which was a large one .
 Confused by the emotion of the day , and feeling his being there with this Double of coarse deportment , to be like a dream , Charles Darnay was at a loss how to answer .
 finally , answered not at all .
 Miss Manette , then .
 Miss Manette , then .
 Looking his companion full in the face while he drank the toast , Carton flung his glass over his shoulder against the wall , where it shivered to pieces .
 then , rang the bell , and ordered in another .
 That's a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark , MrDarnay .
 he said , ruing his new goblet .
 A slight frown and a laconic Yes , were the answer .
 Again Darnay answered not a word .
 She was mightily pleased to have your message , when I gave it her .
 Not that she showed she was pleased , but I suppose she was .
 The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this disagreeable companion had , of his own free will , assisted him in the strait of the day .
 He turned the dialogue to that point , and thanked him for it .
 I neither want any thanks , nor merit any , was the careless rejoinder .
 It was nothing to do , in the first place .
 and I don't know why I did it , in the second .
 MrDarnay , let me ask you a question .
 Do you think I particularly like you .
 Really , MrCarton , returned the other , oddly disconcerted , I have not asked myself the question .
 But ask yourself the question now .
 I don't think I do , said Carton .
 I begin to have a very good opinion of your understanding .
 Carton rejoining , Nothing in life .
 Darnay rang .
 Do you call the whole reckoning .
 said Carton .
 On his answering in the affirmative , Then bring me another pint of this same wine , drawer , and come and wake me at ten .
 I think you have been drinking , MrCarton .
 Think .
 You know I have been drinking .
 Since I must say so , I know it .
 Then you shall likewise know why .
 I am a disappointed drudge , sir .
 I care for no man on earth , and no man on earth cares for me .
 Much to be regretted .
 You might have used your talents better .
 May be so , MrDarnay .
 may be not .
 Don't let your sober face elate you , however .
 you don't know what it may come to .
 Good night .
 A favourite at the Old Bailey , and eke at the Sessions , MrStryver had begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on which he mounted .
 Sessions and Old Bailey had now to summon their favourite , specially , to their longing arms .
 and shouldering itself towards the visage of the Lord Chief Justice in the Court of King's Bench , the florid countenance of MrStryver might be daily seen , bursting out of the bed of wigs , like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from among a rank garden-full of flaring companions .
 It had once been noted at the Bar , that while MrStryver was a glib man , and an unscrupulous , and a ready , and a bold , he had not that faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements , which is among the most striking and necessary of the advocate's accomplishments .
 But , a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this .
 The more business he got , the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its pith and marrow .
 and however late at night he sat carousing with Sydney Carton , he always had his points at his fingers' ends in the morning .
 Ten o'clock , sir .
 What do you mean .
 Ten o'clock at night .
 Yes , sir .
 Your honour told me to call you .
 Oh .
 I remember .
 Very well , very well .
 You are a little late , Memory , said Stryver .
 About the usual time .
 it may be a quarter of an hour later .
 They went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with papers , where there was a blazing fire .
 A kettle steamed upon the hob , and in the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone , with plenty of wine upon it , and brandy , and rum , and sugar , and lemons .
 You have had your bottle , I perceive , Sydney .
 I thought he was rather a handsome fellow , and I thought I should have been much the same sort of fellow , if I had had any luck .
 MrStryver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch .
 You and your luck , Sydney .
 Get to work , get to work .
 Not much boiling down to be done to-night , Memory , said MrStryver , gaily , as he looked among his papers .
 How much .
 Only two sets of them .
 Give me the worst first .
 There they are , Sydney .
 Fire away .
 And now we have done , Sydney , fill a bumper of punch , said MrStryver .
 With a deprecatory grunt , the jackal again complied .
 And why not .
 God knows .
 It was my way , I suppose .
 He sat , with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before him , looking at the fire .
 Oh , botheration .
 returned Sydney , with a lighter and more good-humoured laugh , don't YOU be moral .
 Partly through paying me to help you , I suppose .
 But it's not worth your while to apostrophise me , or the air , about it .
 what you want to do , you do .
 You were always in the front rank , and I was always behind .
 I had to get into the front rank .
 I was not born there , was I .
 Before Shrewsbury , and at Shrewsbury , and ever since Shrewsbury , pursued Carton , you have fallen into your rank , and I have fallen into mine .
 Even when we were fellow-students in the Student-Quarter of Paris , picking up French , and French law , and other French crumbs that we didn't get much good of , you were always somewhere , and I was always nowhere .
 And whose fault was that .
 Well then .
 Pledge me to the pretty witness , said Stryver , holding up his glass .
 Are you turned in a pleasant direction .
 Apparently not , for he became gloomy again .
 Pretty witness , he muttered , looking down into his glass .
 I have had enough of witnesses to-day and to-night .
 who's your pretty witness .
 The picturesque doctor's daughter , Miss Manette .
 Is she not .
 No .
 Why , man alive , she was the admiration of the whole Court .
 Rot the admiration of the whole Court .
 Who made the Old Bailey a judge of beauty .
 She was a golden-haired doll .
 Quick to see what happened .
 If a girl , doll or no doll , swoons within a yard or two of a man's nose , he can see it without a perspective-glass .
 I pledge you , but I deny the beauty .
 And now I'll have no more drink .
 I'll get to bed .
 On this certain fine Sunday , MrLorry walked towards Soho , early in the afternoon , for three reasons of habit .
 Firstly , because , on fine Sundays , he often walked out , before dinner , with the Doctor and Lucie .
 secondly , because , on unfavourable Sundays , he was accustomed to be with them as the family friend , talking , reading , looking out of window , and generally getting through the day .
 thirdly , because he happened to have his own little shrewd doubts to solve , and knew how the ways of the Doctor's household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving them .
 Expected home .
 Miss Lucie at home .
 Expected home .
 Miss Pross at home .
 Possibly at home , but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to anticipate intentions of Miss Pross , as to admission or denial of the fact .
 As I am at home myself , said MrLorry , I'll go upstairs .
 I wonder , said MrLorry , pausing in his looking about , that he keeps that reminder of his sufferings about him .
 And why wonder at that .
 was the abrupt inquiry that made him start .
 I should have thought MrLorry began .
 I am pretty well , I thank you , answered MrLorry , with meekness .
 how are you .
 Nothing to boast of , said Miss Pross .
 Indeed .
 Ah .
 indeed .
 said Miss Pross .
 I am very much put out about my Ladybird .
 Indeed .
 Really , then .
 said MrLorry , as an amendment .
 Really , is bad enough , returned Miss Pross , but better .
 Yes , I am very much put out .
 May I ask the cause .
 I don't want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of Ladybird , to come here looking after her , said Miss Pross .
 DO dozens come for that purpose .
 Hundreds , said Miss Pross .
 It was characteristic of this lady as of some other people before her time and since that whenever her original proposition was questioned , she exaggerated it .
 I have lived with the darlingor the darling has lived with me , and paid me for it .
 which she certainly should never have done , you may take your affidavit , if I could have afforded to keep either myself or her for nothing--since she was ten years old .
 And it's really very hard , said Miss Pross .
 Not seeing with precision what was very hard , MrLorry shook his head .
 using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would fit anything .
 All sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet , are always turning up , said Miss Pross .
 When you began it .
 I began it , Miss Pross .
 Didn't you .
 Who brought her father to life .
 Oh .
 If THAT was beginning it said MrLorry .
 There never was , nor will be , but one man worthy of Ladybird , said Miss Pross .
 and that was my brother Solomon , if he hadn't made a mistake in life .
 Never .
 And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him .
 Do you believe that he thinks of it much .
 I do , said Miss Pross .
 Do you imagine MrLorry had begun , when Miss Pross took him up short with : 
 Never imagine anything .
 Have no imagination at all .
 I stand corrected .
 do you supposeyou go so far as to suppose , sometimes .
 Now and then , said Miss Pross .
 I don't suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me .
 And that is .
 That she thinks he has .
 Dull .
 Miss Pross inquired , with placidity .
 Well .
 To the best of my understanding , and bad's the best , you'll tell me , said Miss Pross , softened by the tone of the apology , he is afraid of the whole subject .
 Afraid .
 It's plain enough , I should think , why he may be .
 It's a dreadful remembrance .
 Besides that , his loss of himself grew out of it .
 Not knowing how he lost himself , or how he recovered himself , he may never feel certain of not losing himself again .
 That alone wouldn't make the subject pleasant , I should think .
 The corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes .
 it had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet , that it seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had set it going .
 Here they are .
 said Miss Pross , rising to break up the conference .
 and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon .
 On Sundays , Miss Pross dined at the Doctor's table , but on other days persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods , either in the lower regions , or in her own room on the second floora blue chamber , to which no one but her Ladybird ever gained admittance .
 On this occasion , Miss Pross , responding to Ladybird's pleasant face and pleasant efforts to please her , unbent exceedingly .
 so the dinner was very pleasant , too .
 It was an oppressive day , and , after dinner , Lucie proposed that the wine should be carried out under the plane-tree , and they should sit there in the air .
 As everything turned upon her , and revolved about her , they went out under the plane-tree , and she carried the wine down for the special benefit of MrLorry .
 She had installed herself , some time before , as MrLorry's cup-bearer .
 and while they sat under the plane-tree , talking , she kept his glass replenished .
 Mysterious backs and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked , and the plane-tree whispered to them in its own way above their heads .
 Still , the Hundreds of people did not present themselves .
 MrDarnay presented himself while they were sitting under the plane-tree , but he was only One .
 I have been there , as you remember , said Darnay , with a smile , though reddening a little angrily , in another character , and not in a character that gives facilities for seeing much of it .
 They told me a curious thing when I was there .
 What was that .
 Lucie asked .
 Tea-time , and Miss Pross making tea , with another fit of the jerks upon her , and yet no Hundreds of people .
 MrCarton had lounged in , but he made only Two .
 It comes surely , said Carton .
 There was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to get shelter before the storm broke .
 the wonderful corner for echoes resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going , yet not a footstep was there .
 A multitude of people , and yet a solitude .
 said Darnay , when they had listened for a while .
 Is it not impressive , MrDarnay .
 asked Lucie .
 Sometimes , I have sat here of an evening , until I have fanciedbut even the shade of a foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night , when all is so black and solemn .
 Let us shudder too .
 We may know what it is .
 It will seem nothing to you .
 Such whims are only impressive as we originate them , I think .
 they are not to be communicated .
 I have sometimes sat alone here of an evening , listening , until I have made the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming by-and-bye into our lives .
 There is a great crowd coming one day into our lives , if that be so , Sydney Carton struck in , in his moody way .
 The footsteps were incessant , and the hurry of them became more and more rapid .
 The corner echoed and re-echoed with the tread of feet .
 some , as it seemed , under the windows .
 some , as it seemed , in the room .
 some coming , some going , some breaking off , some stopping altogether .
 all in the distant streets , and not one within sight .
 I take them into mine .
 said Carton .
 I ask no questions and make no stipulations .
 There is a great crowd bearing down upon us , Miss Manette , and I see themby the Lightning .
 He added the last words , after there had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window .
 And I hear them .
 he added again , after a peal of thunder .
 Here they come , fast , fierce , and furious .
 It was the rush and roar of rain that he typified , and it stopped him , for no voice could be heard in it .
 A memorable storm of thunder and lightning broke with that sweep of water , and there was not a moment's interval in crash , and fire , and rain , until after the moon rose at midnight .
 Good night , MrCarton , said the man of business .
 Good night , MrDarnay .
 Shall we ever see such a night again , together .
 Perhaps .
 Perhaps , see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar , bearing down upon them , too .
 Monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business , which was , to let everything go on in its own way .
 of particular public business , Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go his waytend to his own power and pocket .
 Of his pleasures , general and particular , Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea , that the world was made for them .
 The text of his order altered from the original by only a pronoun , which is not much ran : The earth and the fulness thereof are mine , saith Monseigneur .
 A sumptuous man was the Farmer-General .
 Thirty horses stood in his stables , twenty-four male domestics sat in his halls , six body-women waited on his wife .
 As one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and forage where he could , the Farmer-Generalhowsoever his matrimonial relations conduced to social moralitywas at least the greatest reality among the personages who attended at the hotel of Monseigneur that day .
 Exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding , which was at that remarkable timeand has been sinceto be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural subject of human interest , were in the most exemplary state of exhaustion , at the hotel of Monseigneur .
 Such homes had these various notabilities left behind them in the fine world of Paris , that the spies among the assembled devotees of Monseigneurforming a goodly half of the polite companywould have found it hard to discover among the angels of that sphere one solitary wife , who , in her manners and appearance , owned to being a Mother .
 Indeed , except for the mere act of bringing a troublesome creature into this worldwhich does not go far towards the realisation of the name of motherthere was no such thing known to the fashion .
 Peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close , and brought them up , and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and supped as at twenty .
 Monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his chocolate , caused the doors of the Holiest of Holiests to be thrown open , and issued forth .
 Then , what submission , what cringing and fawning , what servility , what abject humiliation .
 As to bowing down in body and spirit , nothing in that way was left for Heavenwhich may have been one among other reasons why the worshippers of Monseigneur never troubled it .
 With that , he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the dust from his feet , and quietly walked downstairs .
 Its owner went downstairs into the courtyard , got into his carriage , and drove away .
 Not many people had talked with him at the reception .
 he had stood in a little space apart , and Monseigneur might have been warmer in his manner .
 It appeared , under the circumstances , rather agreeable to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses , and often barely escaping from being run down .
 His man drove as if he were charging an enemy , and the furious recklessness of the man brought no check into the face , or to the lips , of the master .
 The complaint had sometimes made itself audible , even in that deaf city and dumb age , that , in the narrow streets without footways , the fierce patrician custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a barbarous manner .
 But , few cared enough for that to think of it a second time , and , in this matter , as in all others , the common wretches were left to get out of their difficulties as they could .
 Why does he make that abominable noise .
 Is it his child .
 The fountain was a little removed .
 for the street opened , where it was , into a space some ten or twelve yards square .
 As the tall man suddenly got up from the ground , and came running at the carriage , Monsieur the Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt .
 Killed .
 shrieked the man , in wild desperation , extending both arms at their length above his head , and staring at him .
 Dead .
 He took out his purse .
 It is extraordinary to me , said he , that you people cannot take care of yourselves and your children .
 One or the other of you is for ever in the way .
 How do I know what injury you have done my horses .
 See .
 Give him that .
 He threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up , and all the heads craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell .
 The tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry , Dead .
 He was arrested by the quick arrival of another man , for whom the rest made way .
 On seeing him , the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder , sobbing and crying , and pointing to the fountain , where some women were stooping over the motionless bundle , and moving gently about it .
 They were as silent , however , as the men .
 I know all , I know all , said the last comer .
 Be a brave man , my Gaspard .
 It is better for the poor little plaything to die so , than to live .
 It has died in a moment without pain .
 Could it have lived an hour as happily .
 You are a philosopher , you there , said the Marquis , smiling .
 How do they call you .
 They call me Defarge .
 Of what trade .
 Monsieur the Marquis , vendor of wine .
 Pick up that , philosopher and vendor of wine , said the Marquis , throwing him another gold coin , and spend it as you will .
 The horses there .
 are they right .
 Hold .
 said Monsieur the Marquis .
 Hold the horses .
 Who threw that .
 So cowed was their condition , and so long and hard their experience of what such a man could do to them , within the law and beyond it , that not a voice , or a hand , or even an eye was raised .
 Among the men , not one .
 But the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily , and looked the Marquis in the face .
 It was not for his dignity to notice it .
 his contemptuous eyes passed over her , and over all the other rats .
 and he leaned back in his seat again , and gave the word Go on .
 Monsieur the Marquis in his travelling carriage which might have been lighter , conducted by four post-horses and two postilions , fagged up a steep hill .
 A blush on the countenance of Monsieur the Marquis was no impeachment of his high breeding .
 it was not from within .
 it was occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his controlthe setting sun .
 The sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it gained the hill-top , that its occupant was steeped in crimson .
 It will die out , said Monsieur the Marquis , glancing at his hands , directly .
 Bring me hither that fellow .
 said the Marquis to the courier .
 I passed you on the road .
 Monseigneur , it is true .
 I had the honour of being passed on the road .
 Monseigneur , it is true .
 What did you look at , so fixedly .
 Monseigneur , I looked at the man .
 He stooped a little , and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the carriage .
 All his fellows stooped to look under the carriage .
 What man , pig .
 And why look there .
 Who .
 demanded the traveller .
 Monseigneur , the man .
 May the Devil carry away these idiots .
 How do you call the man .
 You know all the men of this part of the country .
 Who was he .
 Your clemency , Monseigneur .
 He was not of this part of the country .
 Of all the days of my life , I never saw him .
 Swinging by the chain .
 To be suffocated .
 What was he like .
 Truly , you did well , said the Marquis , felicitously sensible that such vermin were not to ruffle him , to see a thief accompanying my carriage , and not open that great mouth of yours .
 Bah .
 Put him aside , Monsieur Gabelle .
 Bah .
 Go aside .
 said Monsieur Gabelle .
 Monseigneur , I am flattered to devote myself to your orders .
 Did he run away , fellow .
 where is that Accursed .
 Did the man run away , Dolt , when we stopped for the drag .
 Monseigneur , he precipitated himself over the hill-side , head first , as a person plunges into the river .
 See to it , Gabelle .
 Go on .
 The half-dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the wheels , like sheep .
 the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky to save their skins and bones .
 they had very little else to save , or they might not have been so fortunate .
 To this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been growing worse , and was not at its worst , a woman was kneeling .
 She turned her head as the carriage came up to her , rose quickly , and presented herself at the carriage-door .
 It is you , Monseigneur .
 Monseigneur , a petition .
 How , then .
 What is it .
 Always petitions .
 What of your husband , the forester .
 Always the same with you people .
 He cannot pay something .
 He has paid all , Monseigneur .
 He is dead .
 Well .
 He is quiet .
 Can I restore him to you .
 Alas , no , Monseigneur .
 But he lies yonder , under a little heap of poor grass .
 Again , well .
 She looked an old woman , but was young .
 Her manner was one of passionate grief .
 by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together with wild energy , and laid one of them on the carriage-doortenderly , caressingly , as if it had been a human breast , and could be expected to feel the appealing touch .
 Monseigneur , hear me .
 Monseigneur , hear my petition .
 My husband died of want .
 so many die of want .
 so many more will die of want .
 Again , well .
 Can I feed them .
 The shadow of a large high-roofed house , and of many over-hanging trees , was upon Monsieur the Marquis by that time .
 and the shadow was exchanged for the light of a flambeau , as his carriage stopped , and the great door of his chateau was opened to him .
 Monseigneur , not yet .
 It is not probable he will arrive to-night .
 nevertheless , leave the table as it is .
 I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour .
 What is that .
 he calmly asked , looking with attention at the horizontal lines of black and stone colour .
 Outside the blinds .
 Open the blinds .
 It was done .
 Monseigneur , it is nothing .
 The trees and the night are all that are here .
 Good , said the imperturbable master .
 Close them again .
 That was done too , and the Marquis went on with his supper .
 He was half way through it , when he again stopped with his glass in his hand , hearing the sound of wheels .
 It came on briskly , and came up to the front of the chateau .
 Ask who is arrived .
 It was the nephew of Monseigneur .
 He had been some few leagues behind Monseigneur , early in the afternoon .
 He had diminished the distance rapidly , but not so rapidly as to come up with Monseigneur on the road .
 He had heard of Monseigneur , at the posting-houses , as being before him .
 He was to be told said Monseigneur that supper awaited him then and there , and that he was prayed to come to it .
 In a little while he came .
 He had been known in England as Charles Darnay .
 Monseigneur received him in a courtly manner , but they did not shake hands .
 You left Paris yesterday , sir .
 he said to Monseigneur , as he took his seat at table .
 Yesterday .
 And you .
 I come direct .
 From London .
 You have been a long time coming , said the Marquis , with a smile .
 On the contrary .
 I come direct .
 Pardon me .
 I mean , not a long time on the journey .
 a long time intending the journey .
 I have been detained bythe nephew stopped a moment in his answervarious business .
 Without doubt , said the polished uncle .
 I have come back , sir , as you anticipate , pursuing the object that took me away .
 It carried me into great and unexpected peril .
 but it is a sacred object , and if it had carried me to death I hope it would have sustained me .
 Not to death , said the uncle .
 it is not necessary to say , to death .
 I doubt , sir , returned the nephew , whether , if it had carried me to the utmost brink of death , you would have cared to stop me there .
 The deepened marks in the nose , and the lengthening of the fine straight lines in the cruel face , looked ominous as to that .
 the uncle made a graceful gesture of protest , which was so clearly a slight form of good breeding that it was not reassuring .
 Indeed , sir , pursued the nephew , for anything I know , you may have expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious circumstances that surrounded me .
 No , no , no , said the uncle , pleasantly .
 But , however that may be , resumed the nephew , glancing at him with deep distrust , I know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means , and would know no scruple as to means .
 I recall it .
 Thank you , said the Marquisevery sweetly indeed .
 His tone lingered in the air , almost like the tone of a musical instrument .
 I do not quite understand , returned the uncle , sipping his coffee .
 Dare I ask you to explain .
 I believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court , and had not been overshadowed by that cloud for years past , a letter de cachet would have sent me to some fortress indefinitely .
 I perceive that , happily for me , the Reception of the day before yesterday was , as usual , a cold one , observed the nephew .
 The Marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff , and shook his head .
 as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still containing himself , that great means of regeneration .
 We have so asserted our station , both in the old time and in the modern time also , said the nephew , gloomily , that I believe our name to be more detested than any name in France .
 Let us hope so , said the uncle .
 Detestation of the high is the involuntary homage of the low .
 Repression is the only lasting philosophy .
 The dark deference of fear and slavery , my friend , observed the Marquis , will keep the dogs obedient to the whip , as long as this roof , looking up to it , shuts out the sky .
 That might not be so long as the Marquis supposed .
 If a picture of the chateau as it was to be a very few years hence , and of fifty like it as they too were to be a very few years hence , could have been shown to him that night , he might have been at a loss to claim his own from the ghastly , fire-charred , plunder-wrecked rains .
 As for the roof he vaunted , he might have found THAT shutting out the sky in a new wayto wit , for ever , from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead was fired , out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets .
 Meanwhile , said the Marquis , I will preserve the honour and repose of the family , if you will not .
 But you must be fatigued .
 Shall we terminate our conference for the night .
 A moment more .
 An hour , if you please .
 Sir , said the nephew , we have done wrong , and are reaping the fruits of wrong .
 WE have done wrong .
 repeated the Marquis , with an inquiring smile , and delicately pointing , first to his nephew , then to himself .
 Death has done that .
 said the Marquis .
 My friend , I will die , perpetuating the system under which I have lived .
 When he had said it , he took a culminating pinch of snuff , and put his box in his pocket .
 Better to be a rational creature , he added then , after ringing a small bell on the table , and accept your natural destiny .
 But you are lost , Monsieur Charles , I see .
 This property and France are lost to me , said the nephew , sadly .
 I renounce them .
 I had no intention , in the words I used , to claim it yet .
 If it passed to me from you , tomorrow .
 Which I have the vanity to hope is not probable .
 or twenty years hence .
 You do me too much honour , said the Marquis .
 still , I prefer that supposition .
 I would abandon it , and live otherwise and elsewhere .
 It is little to relinquish .
 What is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin .
 Hah .
 said the Marquis , glancing round the luxurious room .
 Hah .
 said the Marquis again , in a well-satisfied manner .
 In England , for example .
 Yes .
 The family honour , sir , is safe from me in this country .
 The family name can suffer from me in no other , for I bear it in no other .
 The ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed-chamber to be lighted .
 It now shone brightly , through the door of communication .
 The Marquis looked that way , and listened for the retreating step of his valet .
 I have already said , that for my prospering there , I am sensible I may be indebted to you , sir .
 For the rest , it is my Refuge .
 They say , those boastful English , that it is the Refuge of many .
 You know a compatriot who has found a Refuge there .
 A Doctor .
 With a daughter .
 Yes , said the Marquis .
 You are fatigued .
 Good night .
 Yes , repeated the Marquis .
 A Doctor with a daughter .
 Yes .
 So commences the new philosophy .
 You are fatigued .
 Good night .
 It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his .
 The nephew looked at him , in vain , in passing on to the door .
 I am cool now , said Monsieur the Marquis , and may go to bed .
 For three heavy hours , the stone faces of the chateau , lion and human , stared blindly at the night .
 Dead darkness lay on all the landscape , dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads .
 The burial-place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass were undistinguishable from one another .
 the figure on the Cross might have come down , for anything that could be seen of it .
 In the village , taxers and taxed were fast asleep .
 Dreaming , perhaps , of banquets , as the starved usually do , and of ease and rest , as the driven slave and the yoked ox may , its lean inhabitants slept soundly , and were fed and freed .
 The Gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night , and had added the one stone face wanting .
 the stone face for which it had waited through about two hundred years .
 Drive him fast to his tomb .
 This , from Jacques .
 In London , he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold , nor to lie on beds of roses .
 if he had had any such exalted expectation , he would not have prospered .
 He had expected labour , and he found it , and did it and made the best of it .
 In this , his prosperity consisted .
 Charles Darnay .
 I rejoice to see you .
 We have been counting on your return these three or four days past .
 MrStryver and Sydney Carton were both here yesterday , and both made you out to be more than due .
 I am obliged to them for their interest in the matter , he answered , a little coldly as to them , though very warmly as to the Doctor .
 Miss Manette .
 said the Doctor , with evident constraint .
 Bring your chair here , and speak on .
 He complied as to the chair , but appeared to find the speaking on less easy .
 He was stayed by the Doctor's putting out his hand to stop him .
 When he had kept it so a little while , he said , drawing it back : 
 Is Lucie the topic .
 She is .
 It is hard for me to speak of her at any time .
 It is very hard for me to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours , Charles Darnay .
 I believe it .
 I do you justice .
 I believe it .
 His constraint was so manifest , and it was so manifest , too , that it originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject , that Charles Darnay hesitated .
 Shall I go on , sir .
 Another blank .
 Not that , sir .
 Let that be .
 I adjure you , do not recall that .
 I ask your pardon , said the Doctor , in a subdued tone , after some moments .
 I do not doubt your loving Lucie .
 you may be satisfied of it .
 Have you spoken to Lucie .
 Nor written .
 Never .
 It would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self-denial is to be referred to your consideration for her father .
 Her father thanks you .
 I believe it , answered her father , mournfully .
 I have thought so before now .
 I believe it .
 He laid his own upon it as he spoke .
 No , dear Doctor Manette .
 Like you , a voluntary exile from France .
 like you , driven from it by its distractions , oppressions , and miseries .
 like you , striving to live away from it by my own exertions , and trusting in a happier future .
 I look only to sharing your fortunes , sharing your life and home , and being faithful to you to the death .
 Not to divide with Lucie her privilege as your child , companion , and friend .
 but to come in aid of it , and bind her closer to you , if such a thing can be .
 His touch still lingered on her father's hand .
 Answering the touch for a moment , but not coldly , her father rested his hands upon the arms of his chair , and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the conference .
 A struggle was evidently in his face .
 a struggle with that occasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread .
 As yet , none .
 Is it the immediate object of this confidence , that you may at once ascertain that , with my knowledge .
 Not even so .
 I might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks .
 I might mistaken or not mistaken have that hopefulness tomorrow .
 Do you seek any guidance from me .
 Do you seek any promise from me .
 I do seek that .
 What is it .
 I well understand that , without you , I could have no hope .
 I well understand that , even if Miss Manette held me at this moment in her innocent heartdo not think I have the presumption to assume so muchI could retain no place in it against her love for her father .
 If that be so , do you see what , on the other hand , is involved in it .
 I am sure of it .
 Charles Darnay , mysteries arise out of close love , as well as out of wide division .
 in the former case , they are subtle and delicate , and difficult to penetrate .
 My daughter Lucie is , in this one respect , such a mystery to me .
 I can make no guess at the state of her heart .
 May I ask , sir , if you think she is As he hesitated , her father supplied the rest .
 Is sought by any other suitor .
 It is what I meant to say .
 Her father considered a little before he answered : 
 You have seen MrCarton here , yourself .
 MrStryver is here too , occasionally .
 If it be at all , it can only be by one of these .
 Or both , said Darnay .
 I had not thought of both .
 I should not think either , likely .
 You want a promise from me .
 Tell me what it is .
 I give the promise , said the Doctor , without any condition .
 I believe your object to be , purely and truthfully , as you have stated it .
 I believe your intention is to perpetuate , and not to weaken , the ties between me and my other and far dearer self .
 If she should ever tell me that you are essential to her perfect happiness , I will give her to you .
 If there were Charles Darnay , if there were .
 The young man had taken his hand gratefully .
 their hands were joined as the Doctor spoke : 
 any fancies , any reasons , any apprehensions , anything whatsoever , new or old , against the man she really lovedthe direct responsibility thereof not lying on his headthey should all be obliterated for her sake .
 She is everything to me .
 more to me than suffering , more to me than wrong , more to meWell .
 This is idle talk .
 Your confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my part .
 My present name , though but slightly changed from my mother's , is not , as you will remember , my own .
 I wish to tell you what that is , and why I am in England .
 said the Doctor of Beauvais .
 Stop .
 Tell me when I ask you , not now .
 If your suit should prosper , if Lucie should love you , you shall tell me on your marriage morning .
 Do you promise .
 Willingly .
 It was dark when Charles Darnay left him , and it was an hour later and darker when Lucie came home .
 she hurried into the room alonefor Miss Pross had gone straight up-stairsand was surprised to find his reading-chair empty .
 My father .
 she called to him .
 Father dear .
 She came down from her bed , to look at him in his sleep that night .
 He slept heavily , and his tray of shoemaking tools , and his old unfinished work , were all as usual .
 Sydney had been working double tides that night , and the night before , and the night before that , and a good many nights in succession , making a grand clearance among MrStryver's papers before the setting in of the long vacation .
 The clearance was effected at last .
 the Stryver arrears were handsomely fetched up .
 everything was got rid of until November should come with its fogs atmospheric , and fogs legal , and bring grist to the mill again .
 I am .
 DO you .
 Yes .
 And not for money .
 What do you say now .
 I don't feel disposed to say much .
 Who is she .
 Guess .
 Do I know her .
 Guess .
 And you , returned Sydney , busy concocting the punch , are such a sensitive and poetical spirit .
 You are a luckier , if you mean that .
 I don't mean that .
 I mean I am a man of moremore .
 Say gallantry , while you are about it , suggested Carton .
 Go on , said Sydney Carton .
 It should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar , to be ashamed of anything , returned Sydney .
 you ought to be much obliged to me .
 Sydney drank a bumper of the punch he had made , and laughed .
 I never saw you do it yet , muttered Carton .
 I do it because it's politic .
 I do it on principle .
 And look at me .
 I get on .
 You don't get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions , answered Carton , with a careless air .
 I wish you would keep to that .
 As to me will you never understand that I am incorrigible .
 He asked the question with some appearance of scorn .
 You have no business to be incorrigible , was his friend's answer , delivered in no very soothing tone .
 I have no business to be , at all , that I know of , said Sydney Carton .
 Who is the lady .
 I did .
 Certainly .
 and in these chambers .
 Sydney Carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacent friend .
 drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend .
 Carton , still drinking the punch , rejoined , Why should I be astonished .
 You approve .
 I'll think of it , said Sydney .
 Accordingly , MrStryver inaugurated the Long Vacation with a formal proposal to take Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens .
 that failing , to Ranelagh .
 that unaccountably failing too , it behoved him to present himself in Soho , and there declare his noble mind .
 Halloa .
 said MrStryver .
 How do you do .
 I hope you are well .
 It was Stryver's grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any place , or space .
 He was so much too big for Tellson's , that old clerks in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance , as though he squeezed them against the wall .
 The House itself , magnificently reading the paper quite in the far-off perspective , lowered displeased , as if the Stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat .
 Can I do anything for you , MrStryver .
 asked MrLorry , in his business character .
 Why , no , thank you .
 this is a private visit to yourself , MrLorry .
 I have come for a private word .
 Oh dear me .
 cried MrLorry , rubbing his chin , and looking at his visitor dubiously .
 Oh dear me , sir .
 repeated Stryver , drawing back .
 Oh dear you , sir .
 What may your meaning be , MrLorry .
 MrLorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that end , and bit the feather of a pen .
 Am I not prosperous .
 asked Stryver .
 And advancing .
 If you come to advancing you know , said MrLorry , delighted to be able to make another admission , nobody can doubt that .
 Then what on earth is your meaning , MrLorry .
 demanded Stryver , perceptibly crestfallen .
 Well .
 IWere you going there now .
 asked MrLorry .
 Straight .
 said Stryver , with a plump of his fist on the desk .
 Then I think I wouldn't , if I was you .
 Because , said MrLorry , I wouldn't go on such an object without having some cause to believe that I should succeed .
 MrLorry glanced at the distant House , and glanced at the angry Stryver .
 Then you mean to tell me , MrLorry , said Stryver , squaring his elbows , that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at present in question is a mincing Fool .
 Not exactly so .
 I mean to tell you , MrStryver , said MrLorry , reddening , that I will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady from any lips .
 and that if I knew any manwhich I hope I do notwhose taste was so coarse , and whose temper was so overbearing , that he could not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at this desk , not even Tellson's should prevent my giving him a piece of my mind .
 The necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put MrStryver's blood-vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry .
 MrLorry's veins , methodical as their courses could usually be , were in no better state now it was his turn .
 That is what I mean to tell you , sir , said MrLorry .
 Pray let there be no mistake about it .
 MrStryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while , and then stood hitting a tune out of his teeth with it , which probably gave him the toothache .
 He broke the awkward silence by saying : 
 Do you ask me for my advice , MrStryver .
 Yes , I do .
 Very good .
 Then I give it , and you have repeated it correctly .
 And all I can say of it is , laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh , that thisha , ha .
 beats everything past , present , and to come .
 Not I .
 said Stryver , whistling .
 I can't undertake to find third parties in common sense .
 I can only find it for myself .
 I suppose sense in certain quarters .
 you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense .
 It's new to me , but you are right , I dare say .
 How long would you keep me in town .
 Oh .
 It is only a question of a few hours .
 I could go to Soho in the evening , and come to your chambers afterwards .
 The barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than moral certainty .
 Unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to swallow , he got it down .
 And now , said MrStryver , shaking his forensic forefinger at the Temple in general , when it was down , my way out of this , is , to put you all in the wrong .
 It was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey tactician , in which he found great relief .
 You shall not put me in the wrong , young lady , said MrStryver .
 I'll do that for you .
 Well .
 said that good-natured emissary , after a full half-hour of bootless attempts to bring him round to the question .
 I have been to Soho .
 To Soho .
 repeated MrStryver , coldly .
 Oh , to be sure .
 What am I thinking of .
 And I have no doubt , said MrLorry , that I was right in the conversation we had .
 My opinion is confirmed , and I reiterate my advice .
 I assure you , returned MrStryver , in the friendliest way , that I am sorry for it on your account , and sorry for it on the poor father's account .
 I know this must always be a sore subject with the family .
 let us say no more about it .
 I don't understand you , said MrLorry .
 I dare say not , rejoined Stryver , nodding his head in a smoothing and final way .
 no matter , no matter .
 But it does matter , MrLorry urged .
 MrLorry was so taken aback , that he looked quite stupidly at MrStryver shouldering him towards the door , with an appearance of showering generosity , forbearance , and goodwill , on his erring head .
 Make the best of it , my dear sir , said Stryver .
 say no more about it .
 thank you again for allowing me to sound you .
 good night .
 If Sydney Carton ever shone anywhere , he certainly never shone in the house of Doctor Manette .
 He had been there often , during a whole year , and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there .
 When he cared to talk , he talked well .
 but , the cloud of caring for nothing , which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness , was very rarely pierced by the light within him .
 He was shown up-stairs , and found Lucie at her work , alone .
 She had never been quite at her ease with him , and received him with some little embarrassment as he seated himself near her table .
 But , looking up at his face in the interchange of the first few common-places , she observed a change in it .
 I fear you are not well , MrCarton .
 No .
 But the life I lead , Miss Manette , is not conducive to health .
 What is to be expected of , or by , such profligates .
 God knows it is a shame .
 Then why not change it .
 Looking gently at him again , she was surprised and saddened to see that there were tears in his eyes .
 There were tears in his voice too , as he answered : 
 It is too late for that .
 I shall never be better than I am .
 I shall sink lower , and be worse .
 He leaned an elbow on her table , and covered his eyes with his hand .
 The table trembled in the silence that followed .
 She had never seen him softened , and was much distressed .
 He knew her to be so , without looking at her , and said : 
 Pray forgive me , Miss Manette .
 I break down before the knowledge of what I want to say to you .
 Will you hear me .
 If it will do you any good , MrCarton , if it would make you happier , it would make me very glad .
 God bless you for your sweet compassion .
 He unshaded his face after a little while , and spoke steadily .
 Don't be afraid to hear me .
 Don't shrink from anything I say .
 I am like one who died young .
 All my life might have been .
 No , MrCarton .
 I am sure that the best part of it might still be .
 I am sure that you might be much , much worthier of yourself .
 She was pale and trembling .
 He came to her relief with a fixed despair of himself which made the interview unlike any other that could have been holden .
 Without it , can I not save you , MrCarton .
 Can I not recall youforgive me again .
 to a better course .
 Can I in no way repay your confidence .
 I know this is a confidence , she modestly said , after a little hesitation , and in earnest tears , I know you would say this to no one else .
 Can I turn it to no good account for yourself , MrCarton .
 He shook his head .
 Will nothing of it remain .
 O MrCarton , think again .
 Try again .
 Since it is my misfortune , MrCarton , to have made you more unhappy than you were before you knew me .
 Since the state of your mind that you describe , is , at all events , attributable to some influence of minethis is what I mean , if I can make it plaincan I use no influence to serve you .
 Have I no power for good , with you , at all .
 Which I entreated you to believe , again and again , most fervently , with all my heart , was capable of better things , MrCarton .
 Entreat me to believe it no more , Miss Manette .
 I have proved myself , and I know better .
 I distress you .
 I draw fast to an end .
 Will you let me believe , when I recall this day , that the last confidence of my life was reposed in your pure and innocent breast , and that it lies there alone , and will be shared by no one .
 If that will be a consolation to you , yes .
 Not even by the dearest one ever to be known to you .
 MrCarton , she answered , after an agitated pause , the secret is yours , not mine .
 and I promise to respect it .
 Thank you .
 And again , God bless you .
 He put her hand to his lips , and moved towards the door .
 I will , MrCarton .
 Hooroar , father .
 cried Young Jerry .
 The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious significance .
 The elder gentleman took the cry so ill , that he watched his opportunity , and smote the young gentleman on the ear .
 What d'ye mean .
 What are you hooroaring at .
 What do you want to conwey to your own father , you young Rip .
 This boy is a getting too many for ME .
 said MrCruncher , surveying him .
 Him and his hooroars .
 Don't let me hear no more of you , or you shall feel some more of me .
 D'ye hear .
 I warn't doing no harm , Young Jerry protested , rubbing his cheek .
 Drop it then , said MrCruncher .
 I won't have none of YOUR no harms .
 Get a top of that there seat , and look at the crowd .
 What is it , brother .
 What's it about .
 I don't know , said the man .
 Spies .
 Yaha .
 Tst .
 Spies .
 He asked another man .
 Who is it .
 Was He a spy .
 asked MrCruncher .
 Old Bailey spy , returned his informant .
 Yaha .
 Tst .
 Yah .
 Old Bailey Spiiies .
 Why , to be sure .
 exclaimed Jerry , recalling the Trial at which he had assisted .
 I've seen him .
 Dead , is he .
 Thus , with beer-drinking , pipe-smoking , song-roaring , and infinite caricaturing of woe , the disorderly procession went its way , recruiting at every step , and all the shops shutting up before it .
 Its destination was the old church of Saint Pancras , far off in the fields .
 It got there in course of time .
 insisted on pouring into the burial-ground .
 finally , accomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way , and highly to its own satisfaction .
 MrCruncher did not assist at the closing sports , but had remained behind in the churchyard , to confer and condole with the undertakers .
 The place had a soothing influence on him .
 He procured a pipe from a neighbouring public-house , and smoked it , looking in at the railings and maturely considering the spot .
 Young Jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest , and reported No job in his absence .
 The bank closed , the ancient clerks came out , the usual watch was set , and MrCruncher and his son went home to tea .
 The dejected MrsCruncher shook her head .
 Why , you're at it afore my face .
 said MrCruncher , with signs of angry apprehension .
 I am saying nothing .
 Yes , Jerry .
 MrCruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations , but made use of them , as people not unfrequently do , to express general ironical dissatisfaction .
 You are going out to-night .
 asked his decent wife , when he took another bite .
 Yes , I am .
 May I go with you , father .
 asked his son , briskly .
 No , you mayn't .
 I'm a goingas your mother knowsa fishing .
 That's where I'm going to .
 Going a fishing .
 Never you mind .
 Shall you bring any fish home , father .
 If I don't , you'll have short commons , to-morrow , returned that gentleman , shaking his head .
 that's questions enough for you .
 I ain't a going out , till you've been long abed .
 And mind you .
 said MrCruncher .
 No games to-morrow .
 If I , as a honest tradesman , succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two , none of your not touching of it , and sticking to bread .
 If I , as a honest tradesman , am able to provide a little beer , none of your declaring on water .
 When you go to Rome , do as Rome does .
 Rome will be a ugly customer to you , if you don't .
 I'm your Rome , you know .
 Then he began grumbling again : 
 I told you I would , said MrCruncher , and I did .
 Jerry , Jerry , Jerry .
 his wife implored .
 You oppose yourself to the profit of the business , said Jerry , and me and my partners suffer .
 You was to honour and obey .
 why the devil don't you .
 I try to be a good wife , Jerry , the poor woman protested , with tears .
 Is it being a good wife to oppose your husband's business .
 Is it honouring your husband to dishonour his business .
 Is it obeying your husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business .
 You hadn't taken to the dreadful business then , Jerry .
 The altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice , and terminated in the honest tradesman's kicking off his clay-soiled boots , and lying down at his length on the floor .
 After taking a timid peep at him lying on his back , with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow , his son lay down too , and fell asleep again .
 There was no fish for breakfast , and not much of anything else .
 MrCruncher was out of spirits , and out of temper , and kept an iron pot-lid by him as a projectile for the correction of MrsCruncher , in case he should observe any symptoms of her saying Grace .
 He was brushed and washed at the usual hour , and set off with his son to pursue his ostensible calling .
 I thought you knowed everything , father , said the artless boy .
 What's his goods , father .
 asked the brisk Young Jerry .
 His goods , said MrCruncher , after turning it over in his mind , is a branch of Scientific goods .
 Persons' bodies , ain't it , father .
 asked the lively boy .
 I believe it is something of that sort , said MrCruncher .
 Oh , father , I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when I'm quite growed up .
 There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge .
 As early as six o'clock in the morning , sallow faces peeping through its barred windows had descried other faces within , bending over measures of wine .
 Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best of times , but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that he sold at this time .
 A sour wine , moreover , or a souring , for its influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy .
 No vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur Defarge : but , a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark , lay hidden in the dregs of it .
 Good day , gentlemen .
 said Monsieur Defarge .
 It may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue .
 It elicited an answering chorus of Good day .
 It is bad weather , gentlemen , said Defarge , shaking his head .
 Upon which , every man looked at his neighbour , and then all cast down their eyes and sat silent .
 Except one man , who got up and went out .
 Have you finished your repast , friend .
 he asked , in due season .
 Yes , thank you .
 Come , then .
 You shall see the apartment that I told you you could occupy .
 It will suit you to a marvel .
 Defarge closed the door carefully , and spoke in a subdued voice : 
 Jacques One , Jacques Two , Jacques Three .
 This is the witness encountered by appointment , by me , Jacques Four .
 He will tell you all .
 Speak , Jacques Five .
 The mender of roads , blue cap in hand , wiped his swarthy forehead with it , and said , Where shall I commence , monsieur .
 Commence , was Monsieur Defarge's not unreasonable reply , at the commencement .
 Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance .
 in which he ought to have been perfect by that time , seeing that it had been the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village during a whole year .
 Jacques One struck in , and asked if he had ever seen the man before .
 Never , answered the mender of roads , recovering his perpendicular .
 Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then .
 You should have said , short as a dwarf , returned Jacques Two .
 He is right there , Jacques , murmured Defarge , to him who had interrupted .
 Go on .
 No matter , the number , said Defarge .
 He is well hidden , but at last he is unluckily found .
 Go on .
 With the aid of his indispensable cap , he represented a man with his elbows bound fast at his hips , with cords that were knotted behind him .
 He described it as if he were there , and it was evident that he saw it vividly .
 perhaps he had not seen much in his life .
 I do not show the soldiers that I recognise the tall man .
 he does not show the soldiers that he recognises me .
 we do it , and we know it , with our eyes .
 Come on .
 ' says the chief of that company , pointing to the village , bring him fast to his tomb .
 ' and they bring him faster .
 I follow .
 His arms are swelled because of being bound so tight , his wooden shoes are large and clumsy , and he is lame .
 Because he is lame , and consequently slow , they drive him with their gunslike this .
 He imitated the action of a man's being impelled forward by the butt-ends of muskets .
 As they descend the hill like madmen running a race , he falls .
 They laugh and pick him up again .
 His face is bleeding and covered with dust , but he cannot touch it .
 thereupon they laugh again .
 They bring him into the village .
 all the village runs to look .
 they take him past the mill , and up to the prison .
 all the village sees the prison gate open in the darkness of the night , and swallow himlike this .
 He opened his mouth as wide as he could , and shut it with a sounding snap of his teeth .
 Observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by opening it again , Defarge said , Go on , Jacques .
 Go on , Jacques , said Defarge .
 Listen then , Jacques , Number One of that name sternly interposed .
 Know that a petition was presented to the King and Queen .
 All here , yourself excepted , saw the King take it , in his carriage in the street , sitting beside the Queen .
 It is Defarge whom you see here , who , at the hazard of his life , darted out before the horses , with the petition in his hand .
 And once again listen , Jacques .
 said the kneeling Number Three : his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves , with a strikingly greedy air , as if he hungered for somethingthat was neither food nor drink .
 the guard , horse and foot , surrounded the petitioner , and struck him blows .
 You hear .
 I hear , messieurs .
 Go on then , said Defarge .
 Thirty-five , said the mender of roads , who looked sixty .
 It was done when you were more than ten years old .
 you might have seen it .
 Enough .
 said Defarge , with grim impatience .
 Long live the Devil .
 Go on .
 It is frightful , messieurs .
 How can the women and the children draw water .
 Who can gossip of an evening , under that shadow .
 Under it , have I said .
 When I left the village , Monday evening as the sun was going to bed , and looked back from the hill , the shadow struck across the church , across the mill , across the prisonseemed to strike across the earth , messieurs , to where the sky rests upon it .
 The hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the other three , and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him .
 That's all , messieurs .
 I left at sunset as I had been warned to do , and I walked on , that night and half next day , until I met as I was warned I should this comrade .
 With him , I came on , now riding and now walking , through the rest of yesterday and through last night .
 And here you see me .
 After a gloomy silence , the first Jacques said , Good .
 You have acted and recounted faithfully .
 Will you wait for us a little , outside the door .
 Very willingly , said the mender of roads .
 Whom Defarge escorted to the top of the stairs , and , leaving seated there , returned .
 The three had risen , and their heads were together when he came back to the garret .
 How say you , Jacques .
 demanded Number One .
 To be registered .
 To be registered , as doomed to destruction , returned Defarge .
 Magnificent .
 croaked the man with the craving .
 The chateau , and all the race .
 inquired the first .
 The chateau and all the race , returned Defarge .
 Extermination .
 The hungry man repeated , in a rapturous croak , Magnificent .
 and began gnawing another finger .
 He knows nothing , said Defarge .
 at least nothing more than would easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height .
 I charge myself with him .
 let him remain with me .
 I will take care of him , and set him on his road .
 He wishes to see the fine worldthe King , the Queen , and Court .
 let him see them on Sunday .
 What .
 exclaimed the hungry man , staring .
 Is it a good sign , that he wishes to see Royalty and Nobility .
 Jacques , said Defarge .
 judiciously show a cat milk , if you wish her to thirst for it .
 Judiciously show a dog his natural prey , if you wish him to bring it down one day .
 Worse quarters than Defarge's wine-shop , could easily have been found in Paris for a provincial slave of that degree .
 Saving for a mysterious dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted , his life was very new and agreeable .
 But , madame sat all day at her counter , so expressly unconscious of him , and so particularly determined not to perceive that his being there had any connection with anything below the surface , that he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her .
 For , he contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady might pretend next .

 it was additionally disconcerting yet , to have madame in the crowd in the afternoon , still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to see the carriage of the King and Queen .

 I have a good deal to do .
