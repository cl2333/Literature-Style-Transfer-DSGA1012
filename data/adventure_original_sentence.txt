You don’t know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer .
 but that ain’t no matter .
 That book was made by MrMark Twain , and he told the truth , mainly .
 There was things which he stretched , but mainly he told the truth .
 That is nothing .
 I never seen anybody but lied one time or another , without it was Aunt Polly , or the widow , or maybe Mary .
 Aunt Polly—Tom’s Aunt Polly , she is—and Mary , and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book , which is mostly a true book , with some stretchers , as I said before .
After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the Bulrushers , and I was in a sweat to find out all about him .
 but by and by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time .
 so then I didn’t care no more about him , because I don’t take no stock in dead people .
Now she had got a start , and she went on and told me all about the good place .
 She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing , forever and ever .
 So I didn’t think much of it .
 But I never said so .
 I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer would go there , and she said not by a considerable sight .
 I was glad about that , because I wanted him and me to be together .
WE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of the widow’s garden , stooping down so as the branches wouldn’t scrape our heads .
 When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made a noise .
 We scrouched down and laid still .
 Miss Watson’s big nigger , named Jim , was setting in the kitchen door .
 we could see him pretty clear , because there was a light behind him .
 He got up and stretched his neck out about a minute , listening .
 Then he says : Who dah .
Say , who is you .
 Whar is you .
 Dog my cats ef I didn’ hear sumf’n .
 Well , I know what I’s gwyne to do : I’s gwyne to set down here and listen tell I hears it agin .
Some thought it would be good to kill the FAMILIES of boys that told the secrets .
 Tom said it was a good idea , so he took a pencil and wrote it in .
Yes , he’s got a father , but you can’t never find him these days .
 He used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard , but he hain’t been seen in these parts for a year or more .
Oh , she’ll do .
 That’s all right .
 Huck can come in .
Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with , and I made my mark on the paper .
Now ,  says Ben Rogers , what’s the line of business of this Gang .
Nothing only robbery and murder ,  Tom said .
Must we always kill the people .
Oh , certainly .
 It’s best .
 Some authorities think different , but mostly it’s considered best to kill them—except some that you bring to the cave here , and keep them till they’re ransomed .
Ransomed .
 What’s that .
But how can we do it if we don’t know what it is .
Why , blame it all , we’ve GOT to do it .
 Don’t I tell you it’s in the books .
 Do you want to go to doing different from what’s in the books , and get things all muddled up .
Oh , that’s all very fine to SAY , Tom Sawyer , but how in the nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don’t know how to do it to them .
 —that’s the thing I want to get at .
 Now , what do you reckon it is .
Well , I don’t know .
 But per’aps if we keep them till they’re ransomed , it means that we keep them till they’re dead .
Now , that’s something LIKE .
 That’ll answer .
 Why couldn’t you said that before .
 We’ll keep them till they’re ransomed to death .
 and a bothersome lot they’ll be , too—eating up everything , and always trying to get loose .
How you talk , Ben Rogers .
 How can they get loose when there’s a guard over them , ready to shoot them down if they move a peg .
A guard .
 Well , that IS good .
 So somebody’s got to set up all night and never get any sleep , just so as to watch them .
 I think that’s foolishness .
 Why can’t a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they get here .
All right .
 I don’t mind .
 but I say it’s a fool way , anyhow .
 Say , do we kill the women , too .
Well , if that’s the way I’m agreed , but I don’t take no stock in it .
Mighty soon we’ll have the cave so cluttered up with women , and fellows waiting to be ransomed , that there won’t be no place for the robbers .
 But go ahead , I ain’t got nothing to say .
I clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking .
 My new clothes was all greased up and clayey , and I was dog-tired .
WELL , I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss Watson on account of my clothes .
 but the widow she didn’t scold , but only cleaned off the grease and clay , and looked so sorry that I thought I would behave awhile if I could .
 Then Miss Watson she took me in the closet and prayed , but nothing come of it .
 She told me to pray every day , and whatever I asked for I would get it .
 But it warn’t so .
 I tried it .
 Once I got a fish-line , but no hooks .
 It warn’t any good to me without hooks .
 I tried for the hooks three or four times , but somehow I couldn’t make it work .
 By and by , one day , I asked Miss Watson to try for me , but she said I was a fool .
 She never told me why , and I couldn’t make it out no way .
We played robber now and then about a month , and then I resigned .
 All the boys did .
 We hadn’t robbed nobody , hadn’t killed any people , but only just pretended .
 We used to hop out of the woods and go charging down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market , but we never hived any of them .
 Tom Sawyer called the hogs ingots ,  and he called the turnips and stuff julery ,  and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done , and how many people we had killed and marked .
 But I couldn’t see no profit in it .
 One time Tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick , which he called a slogan which was the sign for the Gang to get together , and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two hundred elephants , and six hundred camels , and over a thousand sumter mules , all loaded down with di’monds , and they didn’t have only a guard of four hundred soldiers , and so we would lay in ambuscade , as he called it , and kill the lot and scoop the things .
 He said we must slick up our swords and guns , and get ready .
 He never could go after even a turnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it , though they was only lath and broomsticks , and you might scour at them till you rotted , and then they warn’t worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before .
 I didn’t believe we could lick such a crowd of Spaniards and A-rabs , but I wanted to see the camels and elephants , so I was on hand next day , Saturday , in the ambuscade .
 and when we got the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill .
 But there warn’t no Spaniards and A-rabs , and there warn’t no camels nor no elephants .
 It warn’t anything but a Sunday-school picnic , and only a primer-class at that .
 We busted it up , and chased the children up the hollow .
 but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam , though Ben Rogers got a rag doll , and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract .
 and then the teacher charged in , and made us drop everything and cut .
 I didn’t see no di’monds , and I told Tom Sawyer so .
 He said there was loads of them there , anyway .
 and he said there was A-rabs there , too , and elephants and things .
 I said , why couldn’t we see them , then .
 He said if I warn’t so ignorant , but had read a book called Don Quixote , I would know without asking .
 He said it was all done by enchantment .
 He said there was hundreds of soldiers there , and elephants and treasure , and so on , but we had enemies which he called magicians .
 and they had turned the whole thing into an infant Sunday-school , just out of spite .
 I said , all right .
 then the thing for us to do was to go for the magicians .
 Tom Sawyer said I was a numskull .
Why ,  said he , a magician could call up a lot of genies , and they would hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack Robinson .
 They are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church .
How you going to get them .
I don’t know .
 How do THEY get them .
Who makes them tear around so .
Why , whoever rubs the lamp or the ring .
 They belong to whoever rubs the lamp or the ring , and they’ve got to do whatever he says .
 If he tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di’monds , and fill it full of chewing-gum , or whatever you want , and fetch an emperor’s daughter from China for you to marry , they’ve got to do it—and they’ve got to do it before sun-up next morning , too .
 And more : they’ve got to waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it , you understand .
How you talk , Huck Finn .
 Why , you’d HAVE to come when he rubbed it , whether you wanted to or not .
Shucks , it ain’t no use to talk to you , Huck Finn .
 You don’t seem to know anything , somehow—perfect saphead .
Why , my boy , you are all out of breath .
 Did you come for your interest .
No , sir ,  I says .
 is there some for me .
Why , what can you mean , my boy .
I says , Don’t you ask me no questions about it , please .
 You’ll take it—won’t you .
He says : 
Well , I’m puzzled .
 Is something the matter .
Please take it ,  says I , and don’t ask me nothing—then I won’t have to tell no lies .
He studied a while , and then he says : 
Oho-o .
 I think I see .
 You want to SELL all your property to me—not give it .
 That’s the correct idea .
Then he wrote something on a paper and read it over , and says : 
So I signed it , and left .
When I lit my candle and went up to my room that night there sat pap—his own self .
Starchy clothes—very .
 You think you’re a good deal of a big-bug , DON’T you .
Maybe I am , maybe I ain’t ,  I says .
Don’t you give me none o’ your lip ,  says he .
 You’ve put on considerable many frills since I been away .
 I’ll take you down a peg before I get done with you .
 You’re educated , too , they say—can read and write .
 You think you’re better’n your father , now , don’t you , because he can’t .
 I’LL take it out of you .
 Who told you you might meddle with such hifalut’n foolishness , hey .
 who told you you could .
The widow .
 She told me .
The widow , hey .
 and who told the widow she could put in her shovel about a thing that ain’t none of her business .
Nobody never told her .
Well , I’ll learn her how to meddle .
 And looky here—you drop that school , you hear .
 I’ll learn people to bring up a boy to put on airs over his own father and let on to be better’n what HE is .
 You lemme catch you fooling around that school again , you hear .
 Your mother couldn’t read , and she couldn’t write , nuther , before she died .
 None of the family couldn’t before THEY died .
 I can’t .
 and here you’re a-swelling yourself up like this .
 I ain’t the man to stand it—you hear .
 Say , lemme hear you read .
I took up a book and begun something about General Washington and the wars .
 When I’d read about a half a minute , he fetched the book a whack with his hand and knocked it across the house .
 He says : 
He took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy , and says :
What’s this .
It’s something they give me for learning my lessons good .
He tore it up , and says : 
I’ll give you something better—I’ll give you a cowhide .
He set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute , and then he says : 
AIN’T you a sweet-scented dandy , though .
 A bed .
 and bedclothes .
 and a look’n’-glass .
 and a piece of carpet on the floor—and your own father got to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard .
 I never see such a son .
 I bet I’ll take some o’ these frills out o’ you before I’m done with you .
 Why , there ain’t no end to your airs—they say you’re rich .
 Hey .
 how’s that .
They lie—that’s how .
Looky here—mind how you talk to me .
 I’m a-standing about all I can stand now—so don’t gimme no sass .
 I’ve been in town two days , and I hain’t heard nothing but about you bein’ rich .
 I heard about it away down the river , too .
 That’s why I come .
 You git me that money to-morrow—I want it .
I hain’t got no money .
It don’t make no difference what you want it for—you just shell it out .
He took it and bit it to see if it was good , and then he said he was going down town to get some whisky .
 said he hadn’t had a drink all day .
 When he had got out on the shed he put his head in again , and cussed me for putting on frills and trying to be better than him .
 and when I reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again , and told me to mind about that school , because he was going to lay for me and lick me if I didn’t drop that .
 
.
Next day he was drunk , and he went to Judge Thatcher’s and bullyragged him , and tried to make him give up the money .
 but he couldn’t , and then he swore he’d make the law force him .
 
.
When he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him .
 So he took him to his own house , and dressed him up clean and nice , and had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family , and was just old pie to him , so to speak .
 And after supper he talked to him about temperance and such things till the old man cried , and said he’d been a fool , and fooled away his life .
 but now he was a-going to turn over a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn’t be ashamed of , and he hoped the judge would help him and not look down on him .
 The judge said he could hug him for them words .
 so he cried , and his wife she cried again .
 pap said he’d been a man that had always been misunderstood before , and the judge said he believed it .
 The old man said that what a man wanted that was down was sympathy , and the judge said it was so .
 so they cried again .
 And when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his hand , and says : 
.
The judge he felt kind of sore .
 He said he reckoned a body could reform the old man with a shotgun , maybe , but he didn’t know no other way .
 
.
WELL , pretty soon the old man was up and around again , and then he went for Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money , and he went for me , too , for not stopping school .
 He catched me a couple of times and thrashed me , but I went to school just the same , and dodged him or outrun him most of the time .
 I didn’t want to go to school much before , but I reckoned I’d go now to spite pap .
 That law trial was a slow business—appeared like they warn’t ever going to get started on it .
 so every now and then I’d borrow two or three dollars off of the judge for him , to keep from getting a cowhiding .
 Every time he got money he got drunk .
 and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town .
 and every time he raised Cain he got jailed .
 He was just suited—this kind of thing was right in his line .
 
.
After supper pap took the jug , and said he had enough whisky there for two drunks and one delirium tremens .
 That was always his word .
 I judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour , and then I would steal the key , or saw myself out , one or t’other .
 He drank and drank , and tumbled down on his blankets by and by .
 but luck didn’t run my way .
 He didn’t go sound asleep , but was uneasy .
 He groaned and moaned and thrashed around this way and that for a long time .
 At last I got so sleepy I couldn’t keep my eyes open all I could do , and so before I knowed what I was about I was sound asleep , and the candle burning .
 
.
I don’t know how long I was asleep , but all of a sudden there was an awful scream and I was up .
 There was pap looking wild , and skipping around every which way and yelling about snakes .
 He said they was crawling up his legs .
 and then he would give a jump and scream , and say one had bit him on the cheek—but I couldn’t see no snakes .
 He started and run round and round the cabin , hollering Take him off .
 take him off .
 he’s biting me on the neck .
  I never see a man look so wild in the eyes .
 Pretty soon he was all fagged out , and fell down panting .
 then he rolled over and over wonderful fast , kicking things every which way , and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands , and screaming and saying there was devils a-hold of him .
 He wore out by and by , and laid still a while , moaning .
 Then he laid stiller , and didn’t make a sound .
 I could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods , and it seemed terrible still .
 He was laying over by the corner .
 By and by he raised up part way and listened , with his head to one side .
 He says , very low : 
.
Then he went down on all fours and crawled off , begging them to let him alone , and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the old pine table , still a-begging .
 and then he went to crying .
 I could hear him through the blanket .
 
.
GIT up .
 What you ’bout .
 
.
I opened my eyes and looked around , trying to make out where I was .
 It was after sun-up , and I had been sound asleep .
 Pap was standing over me looking sour and sick , too .
 He says : 
.
What you doin’ with this gun .
 
.
I judged he didn’t know nothing about what he had been doing , so I says : 
.
Somebody tried to get in , so I was laying for him .
 
.
Why didn’t you roust me out .
 
.
It was pretty close to the shanty , and I thought I heard the old man coming all the time .
 but I got her hid .
 and then I out and looked around a bunch of willows , and there was the old man down the path a piece just drawing a bead on a bird with his gun .
 So he hadn’t seen anything .
 
.
Another time a man comes a-prowling round here you roust me out , you hear .
 That man warn’t here for no good .
 I’d a shot him .
 Next time you roust me out , you hear .
 
.
I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging out so many things .
 So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside by scattering dust on the place , which covered up the smoothness and the sawdust .
 Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place , and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there , for it was bent up at that place and didn’t quite touch ground .
 If you stood four or five foot away and didn’t know it was sawed , you wouldn’t never notice it .
 and besides , this was the back of the cabin , and it warn’t likely anybody would go fooling around there .
 
.
It was all grass clear to the canoe , so I hadn’t left a track .
 I followed around to see .
 I stood on the bank and looked out over the river .
 All safe .
 So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods , and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig .
 hogs soon went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie farms .
 I shot this fellow and took him into camp .
 
.
I was pretty tired , and the first thing I knowed I was asleep .
 When I woke up I didn’t know where I was for a minute .
 I set up and looked around , a little scared .
 Then I remembered .
 The river looked miles and miles across .
 The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs that went a-slipping along , black and still , hundreds of yards out from shore .
 Everything was dead quiet , and it looked late , and SMELT late .
 You know what I mean—I don’t know the words to put it in .
 
.
I took a good gap and a stretch , and was just going to unhitch and start when I heard a sound away over the water .
 I listened .
 Pretty soon I made it out .
 It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from oars working in rowlocks when it’s a still night .
 I peeped out through the willow branches , and there it was—a skiff , away across the water .
 I couldn’t tell how many was in it .
 It kept a-coming , and when it was abreast of me I see there warn’t but one man in it .
 Think’s I , maybe it’s pap , though I warn’t expecting him .
 He dropped below me with the current , and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water , and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him .
 Well , it WAS pap , sure enough—and sober , too , by the way he laid his oars .
 
.
It didn’t take me long to get there .
 I shot past the head at a ripping rate , the current was so swift , and then I got into the dead water and landed on the side towards the Illinois shore .
 I run the canoe into a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about .
 I had to part the willow branches to get in .
 and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe from the outside .
 
.
I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke , and went on watching .
 The ferryboat was floating with the current , and I allowed I’d have a chance to see who was aboard when she come along , because she would come in close , where the bread did .
 When she’d got pretty well along down towards me , I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread , and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place .
 Where the log forked I could peep through .
 
.
By and by she come along , and she drifted in so close that they could a run out a plank and walked ashore .
 Most everybody was on the boat .
 Pap , and Judge Thatcher , and Bessie Thatcher , and Jo Harper , and Tom Sawyer , and his old Aunt Polly , and Sid and Mary , and plenty more .
 Everybody was talking about the murder , but the captain broke in and says : 
.
Look sharp , now .
 the current sets in the closest here , and maybe he’s washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water’s edge .
 I hope so , anyway .
 
.
I knowed I was all right now .
 Nobody else would come a-hunting after me .
 I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick woods .
 I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things under so the rain couldn’t get at them .
 I catched a catfish and haggled him open with my saw , and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had supper .
 Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast .
 
.
Well , I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn’t far from the foot of the island .
 I had my gun along , but I hadn’t shot nothing .
 it was for protection .
 thought I would kill some game nigh home .
 About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake , and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers , and I after it , trying to get a shot at it .
 I clipped along , and all of a sudden I bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking .
 
.
We better camp here if we can find a good place .
 the horses is about beat out .
 Let’s look around .
 
.
I didn’t wait , but shoved out and paddled away easy .
 I tied up in the old place , and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe .
 
.
Hello , Jim .
  and skipped out .
 
.
He bounced up and stared at me wild .
 Then he drops down on his knees , and puts his hands together and says : 
.
It’s good daylight .
 Le’s get breakfast .
 Make up your camp fire good .
 
.
What’s de use er makin’ up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich truck .
 But you got a gun , hain’t you .
 Den we kin git sumfn better den strawbries .
 
.
Strawberries and such truck ,  I says .
 Is that what you live on .
 
.
I couldn’ git nuffn else ,  he says .
 
.
Why , how long you been on the island , Jim .
 
.
I come heah de night arter you’s killed .
 
.
Yes—indeedy .
 
.
And ain’t you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat .
 
.
No , sah—nuffn else .
 
.
Well , you must be most starved , ain’t you .
 
.
I reck’n I could eat a hoss .
 I think I could .
 How long you ben on de islan’ .
 
.
Since the night I got killed .
 
.
No .
 W’y , what has you lived on .
 But you got a gun .
 Oh , yes , you got a gun .
 Dat’s good .
 Now you kill sumfn en I’ll make up de fire .
 
.
When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot .
 Jim laid it in with all his might , for he was most about starved .
 Then when we had got pretty well stuffed , we laid off and lazied .
 By and by Jim says : 
.
Then I told him the whole thing , and he said it was smart .
 He said Tom Sawyer couldn’t get up no better plan than what I had .
 Then I says : 
.
He looked pretty uneasy , and didn’t say nothing for a minute .
 Then he says : 
.
Maybe I better not tell .
 
.
Why , Jim .
 
.
Well , dey’s reasons .
 But you wouldn’ tell on me ef I uz to tell you , would you , Huck .
 
.
Blamed if I would , Jim .
 
.
Well , I b’lieve you , Huck .
 I—I RUN OFF .
 
.
Jim .
 
.
Well , when it come dark I tuck out up de river road , en went ’bout two mile er more to whah dey warn’t no houses .
 I’d made up my mine ’bout what I’s agwyne to do .
 You see , ef I kep’ on tryin’ to git away afoot , de dogs ’ud track me .
 ef I stole a skift to cross over , dey’d miss dat skift , you see , en dey’d know ’bout whah I’d lan’ on de yuther side , en whah to pick up my track .
 So I says , a raff is what I’s arter .
 it doan’ MAKE no track .
 
.
And so you ain’t had no meat nor bread to eat all this time .
 Why didn’t you get mud-turkles .
 
.
Well , that’s so .
 You’ve had to keep in the woods all the time , of course .
 Did you hear ’em shooting the cannon .
 
.
Oh , yes .
 I knowed dey was arter you .
 I see um go by heah—watched um thoo de bushes .
 
.
And Jim said you mustn’t count the things you are going to cook for dinner , because that would bring bad luck .
 The same if you shook the table-cloth after sundown .
 And he said if a man owned a beehive and that man died , the bees must be told about it before sun-up next morning , or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die .
 Jim said bees wouldn’t sting idiots .
 but I didn’t believe that , because I had tried them lots of times myself , and they wouldn’t sting me .
 
.
I had heard about some of these things before , but not all of them .
 Jim knowed all kinds of signs .
 He said he knowed most everything .
 I said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck , and so I asked him if there warn’t any good-luck signs .
 He says : 
.
Have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast , Jim .
 
.
What’s de use to ax dat question .
 Don’t you see I has .
 
.
Well , are you rich .
 
.
What did you speculate in , Jim .
 
.
Well , fust I tackled stock .
 
.
What kind of stock .
 
.
Why , live stock—cattle , you know .
 I put ten dollars in a cow .
 But I ain’ gwyne to resk no mo’ money in stock .
 De cow up ’n’ died on my han’s .
 
.
So you lost the ten dollars .
 
.
No , I didn’t lose it all .
 I on’y los’ ’bout nine of it .
 I sole de hide en taller for a dollar en ten cents .
 
.
You had five dollars and ten cents left .
 Did you speculate any more .
 
.
So I done it .
 Den I reck’n’d I’d inves’ de thirty-five dollars right off en keep things a-movin’ .
 Dey wuz a nigger name’ Bob , dat had ketched a wood-flat , en his marster didn’ know it .
 en I bought it off’n him en told him to take de thirty-five dollars when de en’ er de year come .
 but somebody stole de wood-flat dat night , en nex day de one-laigged nigger say de bank’s busted .
 So dey didn’ none uv us git no money .
 
.
What did you do with the ten cents , Jim .
 
.
Well , I ’uz gwyne to spen’ it , but I had a dream , en de dream tole me to give it to a nigger name’ Balum—Balum’s Ass dey call him for short .
 he’s one er dem chuckleheads , you know .
 But he’s lucky , dey say , en I see I warn’t lucky .
 De dream say let Balum inves’ de ten cents en he’d make a raise for me .
 Well , Balum he tuck de money , en when he wuz in church he hear de preacher say dat whoever give to de po’ len’ to de Lord , en boun’ to git his money back a hund’d times .
 So Balum he tuck en give de ten cents to de po’ , en laid low to see what wuz gwyne to come of it .
 
.
Well , what did come of it , Jim .
 
.
Well , it’s all right anyway , Jim , long as you’re going to be rich again some time or other .
 
.
I WANTED to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island that I’d found when I was exploring .
 so we started and soon got to it , because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide .
 
.
This place was a tolerable long , steep hill or ridge about forty foot high .
 We had a rough time getting to the top , the sides was so steep and the bushes so thick .
 We tramped and clumb around all over it , and by and by found a good big cavern in the rock , most up to the top on the side towards Illinois .
 The cavern was as big as two or three rooms bunched together , and Jim could stand up straight in it .
 It was cool in there .
 Jim was for putting our traps in there right away , but I said we didn’t want to be climbing up and down there all the time .
 
.
Jim , this is nice ,  I says .
 I wouldn’t want to be nowhere else but here .
 Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot corn-bread .
 
.
Well , you wouldn’t a ben here ’f it hadn’t a ben for Jim .
 You’d a ben down dah in de woods widout any dinner , en gittn’ mos’ drownded , too .
 dat you would , honey .
 Chickens knows when it’s gwyne to rain , en so do de birds , chile .
 
.
The river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days , till at last it was over the banks .
 The water was three or four foot deep on the island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom .
 On that side it was a good many miles wide , but on the Missouri side it was the same old distance across—a half a mile—because the Missouri shore was just a wall of high bluffs .
 
.
Another night when we was up at the head of the island , just before daylight , here comes a frame-house down , on the west side .
 She was a two-story , and tilted over considerable .
 We paddled out and got aboard—clumb in at an upstairs window .
 But it was too dark to see yet , so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight .
 
.
Hello , you .
 
.
But it didn’t budge .
 So I hollered again , and then Jim says : 
.
De man ain’t asleep—he’s dead .
 You hold still—I’ll go en see .
 
.
He went , and bent down and looked , and says : 
.
It’s a dead man .
 Yes , indeedy .
 naked , too .
 He’s ben shot in de back .
 I reck’n he’s ben dead two er three days .
 Come in , Huck , but doan’ look at his face—it’s too gashly .
 
.
Now you think it’s bad luck .
 but what did you say when I fetched in the snake-skin that I found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday .
 You said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snake-skin with my hands .
 Well , here’s your bad luck .
 We’ve raked in all this truck and eight dollars besides .
 I wish we could have some bad luck like this every day , Jim .
 
.
Never you mind , honey , never you mind .
 Don’t you git too peart .
 It’s a-comin’ .
 Mind I tell you , it’s a-comin’ .
 
.
I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark .
 
.
COME in ,  says the woman , and I did .
 She says : Take a cheer .
 
.
I done it .
 She looked me all over with her little shiny eyes , and says : 
.
What might your name be .
 
.
Sarah Williams .
 
.
Where ’bouts do you live .
 In this neighborhood .
 ’
.
No’m .
 In Hookerville , seven mile below .
 I’ve walked all the way and I’m all tired out .
 
.
Hungry , too , I reckon .
 I’ll find you something .
 
.
No’m , I ain’t hungry .
 I was so hungry I had to stop two miles below here at a farm .
 so I ain’t hungry no more .
 It’s what makes me so late .
 My mother’s down sick , and out of money and everything , and I come to tell my uncle Abner Moore .
 He lives at the upper end of the town , she says .
 I hain’t ever been here before .
 Do you know him .
 
.
No ,  I says .
 I’ll rest a while , I reckon , and go on .
 I ain’t afeared of the dark .
 
.
Who done it .
 We’ve heard considerable about these goings on down in Hookerville , but we don’t know who ’twas that killed Huck Finn .
 
.
Well , I reckon there’s a right smart chance of people HERE that’d like to know who killed him .
 Some think old Finn done it himself .
 
.
No—is that so .
 
.
Most everybody thought it at first .
 He’ll never know how nigh he come to getting lynched .
 But before night they changed around and judged it was done by a runaway nigger named Jim .
 
.
Why HE—
.
Yes , I reckon so , ’m .
 I don’t see nothing in the way of it .
 Has everybody quit thinking the nigger done it .
 
.
Why , are they after him yet .
 
.
Three hundred dollars is a power of money .
 I wish my mother could get it .
 Is your husband going over there to-night .
 
.
Oh , yes .
 He went up-town with the man I was telling you of , to get a boat and see if they could borrow another gun .
 They’ll go over after midnight .
 
.
Couldn’t they see better if they was to wait till daytime .
 
.
I didn’t think of that .
 
.
The woman kept looking at me pretty curious , and I didn’t feel a bit comfortable .
 Pretty soon she says , 
.
What did you say your name was , honey .
 
.
M—Mary Williams .
 
.
Somehow it didn’t seem to me that I said it was Mary before , so I didn’t look up—seemed to me I said it was Sarah .
 so I felt sort of cornered , and was afeared maybe I was looking it , too .
 I wished the woman would say something more .
 the longer she set still the uneasier I was .
 But now she says : 
.
Honey , I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in .
 
.
Oh , yes’m , I did .
 Sarah Mary Williams .
 Sarah’s my first name .
 Some calls me Sarah , some calls me Mary .
 
.
Oh , that’s the way of it .
 
.
Yes’m .
 
.
I was feeling better then , but I wished I was out of there , anyway .
 I couldn’t look up yet .
 
.
Keep your eye on the rats .
 You better have the lead in your lap , handy .
 
.
Come , now , what’s your real name .
 
.
Wh—what , mum .
 
.
What’s your real name .
 Is it Bill , or Tom , or Bob .
 —or what is it .
 
.
Goshen , child .
 This ain’t Goshen .
 This is StPetersburg .
 Goshen’s ten mile further up the river .
 Who told you this was Goshen .
 
.
Why , a man I met at daybreak this morning , just as I was going to turn into the woods for my regular sleep .
 He told me when the roads forked I must take the right hand , and five mile would fetch me to Goshen .
 
.
He was drunk , I reckon .
 He told you just exactly wrong .
 
.
Well , he did act like he was drunk , but it ain’t no matter now .
 I got to be moving along .
 I’ll fetch Goshen before daylight .
 
.
Hold on a minute .
 I’ll put you up a snack to eat .
 You might want it .
 
.
So she put me up a snack , and says : 
.
Say , when a cow’s laying down , which end of her gets up first .
 Answer up prompt now—don’t stop to study over it .
 Which end gets up first .
 
.
The hind end , mum .
 
.
Well , then , a horse .
 
.
The for’rard end , mum .
 
.
Which side of a tree does the moss grow on .
 
.
North side .
 
.
If fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside , how many of them eats with their heads pointed the same direction .
 
.
The whole fifteen , mum .
 
.
Well , I reckon you HAVE lived in the country .
 I thought maybe you was trying to hocus me again .
 What’s your real name , now .
 
.
George Peters , mum .
 
.
Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place , a mile and a half below , as hard as I could go .
 I landed , and slopped through the timber and up the ridge and into the cavern .
 There Jim laid , sound asleep on the ground .
 I roused him out and says : 
.
Git up and hump yourself , Jim .
 There ain’t a minute to lose .
 They’re after us .
 
.
I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece , and took a look .
 but if there was a boat around I couldn’t see it , for stars and shadows ain’t good to see by .
 Then we got out the raft and slipped along down in the shade , past the foot of the island dead still—never saying a word .
 
.
When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a big bend on the Illinois side , and hacked off cottonwood branches with the hatchet , and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there had been a cave-in in the bank there .
 A tow-head is a sandbar that has cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth .
 
.
We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning or didn’t go to bed early enough in the evening .
 Take it all round , we lived pretty high .
 
.
Let’s land on her , Jim .
 
.
But Jim was dead against it at first .
 He says : 
.
I doan’ want to go fool’n ’long er no wrack .
 We’s doin’ blame’ well , en we better let blame’ well alone , as de good book says .
 Like as not dey’s a watchman on dat wrack .
 
.
Jim he grumbled a little , but give in .
 He said we mustn’t talk any more than we could help , and then talk mighty low .
 The lightning showed us the wreck again just in time , and we fetched the stabboard derrick , and made fast there .
 
.
Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick , and told me to come along .
 I says , all right , and was going to start for the raft .
 but just then I heard a voice wail out and say : 
.
Oh , please don’t , boys .
 I swear I won’t ever tell .
 
.
Another voice said , pretty loud : 
.
It’s a lie , Jim Turner .
 You’ve acted this way before .
 You always want more’n your share of the truck , and you’ve always got it , too , because you’ve swore ’t if you didn’t you’d tell .
 But this time you’ve said it jest one time too many .
 You’re the meanest , treacherousest hound in this country .
 
.
I’d LIKE to .
 And I orter , too—a mean skunk .
 
.
The man on the floor would shrivel up and say , Oh , please don’t , Bill .
 I hain’t ever goin’ to tell .
 
.
And every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and say : 
.
’Deed you AIN’T .
 You never said no truer thing ’n that , you bet you .
  And once he said : Hear him beg .
 and yit if we hadn’t got the best of him and tied him he’d a killed us both .
 And what FOR .
 Jist for noth’n .
 Jist because we stood on our RIGHTS—that’s what for .
 But I lay you ain’t a-goin’ to threaten nobody any more , Jim Turner .
 Put UP that pistol , Bill .
 
.
Bill says : 
.
But I don’t WANT him killed , and I’ve got my reasons for it .
 
.
Here—come in here .
 
.
He’s said he’ll tell , and he will .
 If we was to give both our shares to him NOW it wouldn’t make no difference after the row and the way we’ve served him .
 Shore’s you’re born , he’ll turn State’s evidence .
 now you hear ME .
 I’m for putting him out of his troubles .
 
.
So’m I ,  says Packard , very quiet .
 
.
Blame it , I’d sorter begun to think you wasn’t .
 Well , then , that’s all right .
 Le’s go and do it .
 
.
You bet it is .
 But how you goin’ to manage it this time .
 
.
Yes , I reck’n you are .
 But s’pose she DON’T break up and wash off .
 
.
Well , we can wait the two hours anyway and see , can’t we .
 
.
Heave that blame lantern out o’ sight , Bill .
 
.
He flung a bag of something into the boat , and then got in himself and set down .
 It was Packard .
 Then Bill HE come out and got in .
 Packard says , in a low voice : 
.
All ready—shove off .
 
.
I couldn’t hardly hang on to the shutters , I was so weak .
 But Bill says : 
.
Hold on—’d you go through him .
 
.
No .
 Didn’t you .
 
.
No .
 So he’s got his share o’ the cash yet .
 
.
Well , then , come along .
 no use to take truck and leave money .
 
.
Say , won’t he suspicion what we’re up to .
 
.
Maybe he won’t .
 But we got to have it anyway .
 Come along .
 
.
So they got out and went in .
 
.
The door slammed to because it was on the careened side .
 and in a half second I was in the boat , and Jim come tumbling after me .
 I out with my knife and cut the rope , and away we went .
 
.
It was the raft , and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again .
 We seen a light now away down to the right , on shore .
 So I said I would go for it .
 The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole there on the wreck .
 We hustled it on to the raft in a pile , and I told Jim to float along down , and show a light when he judged he had gone about two mile , and keep it burning till I come .
 then I manned my oars and shoved for the light .
 As I got down towards it three or four more showed—up on a hillside .
 It was a village .
 I closed in above the shore light , and laid on my oars and floated .
 As I went by I see it was a lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferryboat .
 I skimmed around for the watchman , a-wondering whereabouts he slept .
 and by and by I found him roosting on the bitts forward , with his head down between his knees .
 I gave his shoulder two or three little shoves , and begun to cry .
 
.
He stirred up in a kind of a startlish way .
 but when he see it was only me he took a good gap and stretch , and then he says : 
.
Hello , what’s up .
 Don’t cry , bub .
 What’s the trouble .
 
.
I says : 
.
Then I broke down .
 He says : 
.
Oh , dang it now , DON’T take on so .
 we all has to have our troubles , and this ’n ’ll come out all right .
 What’s the matter with ’em .
 
.
I broke in and says : 
.
WHO is .
 
.
Up where .
 Where are they .
 
.
On the wreck .
 
.
What wreck .
 
.
Why , there ain’t but one .
 
.
What , you don’t mean the Walter Scott .
 
.
Yes .
 
.
Good land .
 what are they doin’ THERE , for gracious sakes .
 
.
Well , they didn’t go there a-purpose .
 
.
I bet they didn’t .
 Why , great goodness , there ain’t no chance for ’em if they don’t git off mighty quick .
 Why , how in the nation did they ever git into such a scrape .
 
.
Easy enough .
 Miss Hooker was a-visiting up there to the town—
.
My George .
 It’s the beatenest thing I ever struck .
 And THEN what did you all do .
 
.
It did seem a powerful long time before Jim’s light showed up .
 and when it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off .
 By the time I got there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east .
 so we struck for an island , and hid the raft , and sunk the skiff , and turned in and slept like dead people .
 
.
AIN’ dat gay .
 En what dey got to do , Huck .
 
.
No .
 is dat so .
 
.
Roun’ de which .
 
.
Harem .
 
.
What’s de harem .
 
.
Well , but he WAS the wisest man , anyway .
 because the widow she told me so , her own self .
 
.
Yes , the widow told me all about it .
 
.
Who .
 Me .
 Go ’long .
 Doan’ talk to me ’bout yo’ pints .
 I reck’n I knows sense when I sees it .
 en dey ain’ no sense in sich doin’s as dat .
 De ’spute warn’t ’bout a half a chile , de ’spute was ’bout a whole chile .
 en de man dat think he kin settle a ’spute ’bout a whole chile wid a half a chile doan’ know enough to come in out’n de rain .
 Doan’ talk to me ’bout Sollermun , Huck , I knows him by de back .
 
.
But I tell you you don’t get the point .
 
.
Po’ little chap .
 
.
But some says he got out and got away , and come to America .
 
.
No .
 
.
Den he cain’t git no situation .
 What he gwyne to do .
 
.
Well , I don’t know .
 Some of them gets on the police , and some of them learns people how to talk French .
 
.
Well , now , I be ding-busted .
 How do dat come .
 
.
I don’t know .
 but it’s so .
 I got some of their jabber out of a book .
 S’pose a man was to come to you and say Polly-voo-franzy—what would you think .
 
.
I wouldn’ think nuff’n .
 I’d take en bust him over de head—dat is , if he warn’t white .
 I wouldn’t ’low no nigger to call me dat .
 
.
Well , den , why couldn’t he SAY it .
 
.
Why , he IS a-saying it .
 That’s a Frenchman’s WAY of saying it .
 
.
Looky here , Jim .
 does a cat talk like we do .
 
.
No , a cat don’t .
 
.
Well , does a cow .
 
.
No , a cow don’t , nuther .
 
.
No , dey don’t .
 
.
It’s natural and right for ’em to talk different from each other , ain’t it .
 
.
Course .
 
.
And ain’t it natural and right for a cat and a cow to talk different from US .
 
.
Why , mos’ sholy it is .
 
.
Well , then , why ain’t it natural and right for a FRENCHMAN to talk different from us .
 You answer me that .
 
.
Is a cat a man , Huck .
 
.
No .
 
.
Well , den , dey ain’t no sense in a cat talkin’ like a man .
 Is a cow a man .
 —er is a cow a cat .
 
.
No , she ain’t either of them .
 
.
Well , den , she ain’t got no business to talk like either one er the yuther of ’em .
 Is a Frenchman a man .
 
.
Yes .
 
.
WELL , den .
 Dad blame it , why doan’ he TALK like a man .
 You answer me DAT .
 
.
I see it warn’t no use wasting words—you can’t learn a nigger to argue .
 So I quit .
 
.
I just give up then .
 I knowed what the matter was .
 That cut bank was an island , and Jim had gone down t’other side of it .
 It warn’t no towhead that you could float by in ten minutes .
 It had the big timber of a regular island .
 it might be five or six miles long and more than half a mile wide .
 
.
I kept quiet , with my ears cocked , about fifteen minutes , I reckon .
 I was floating along , of course , four or five miles an hour .
 but you don’t ever think of that .
 No , you FEEL like you are laying dead still on the water .
 and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don’t think to yourself how fast YOU’RE going , but you catch your breath and think , my .
 how that snag’s tearing along .
 If you think it ain’t dismal and lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night , you try it once—you’ll see .
 
.
When I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down between his knees , asleep , with his right arm hanging over the steering-oar .
 The other oar was smashed off , and the raft was littered up with leaves and branches and dirt .
 So she’d had a rough time .
 
.
What’s the matter with you , Jim .
 You been a-drinking .
 
.
Drinkin’ .
 Has I ben a-drinkin’ .
 Has I had a chance to be a-drinkin’ .
 
.
Well , then , what makes you talk so wild .
 
.
Gone away .
 Why , what in the nation do you mean .
 I hain’t been gone anywheres .
 Where would I go to .
 
.
Well , I think you’re here , plain enough , but I think you’re a tangle-headed old fool , Jim .
 
.
I is , is I .
 Well , you answer me dis : Didn’t you tote out de line in de canoe fer to make fas’ to de tow-head .
 
.
No , I didn’t .
 What tow-head .
 I hain’t see no tow-head .
 
.
What fog .
 
.
Dad fetch it , how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes .
 
.
Well , hang it all , you did dream it , because there didn’t any of it happen .
 
.
It don’t make no difference how plain it is .
 there ain’t nothing in it .
 I know , because I’ve been here all the time .
 
.
Well , den , I reck’n I did dream it , Huck .
 but dog my cats ef it ain’t de powerfullest dream I ever see .
 En I hain’t ever had no dream b’fo’ dat’s tired me like dis one .
 
.
Oh , well , that’s all right , because a dream does tire a body like everything sometimes .
 But this one was a staving dream .
 tell me all about it , Jim .
 
.
It had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on to the raft , but it was clearing up again now .
 
.
Oh , well , that’s all interpreted well enough as far as it goes , Jim ,  I says .
 but what does THESE things stand for .
 
.
It was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar .
 You could see them first-rate now .
 
.
Jim looked at the trash , and then looked at me , and back at the trash again .
 He had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he couldn’t seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place again right away .
 But when he did get the thing straightened around he looked at me steady without ever smiling , and says : 
.
Then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam , and went in there without saying anything but that .
 But that was enough .
 It made me feel so mean I could almost kissed HIS foot to get him to take it back .
 
.
It was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humble myself to a nigger .
 but I done it , and I warn’t ever sorry for it afterwards , neither .
 I didn’t do him no more mean tricks , and I wouldn’t done that one if I’d a knowed it would make him feel that way .
 
.
There warn’t nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town , and not pass it without seeing it .
 He said he’d be mighty sure to see it , because he’d be a free man the minute he seen it , but if he missed it he’d be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom .
 Every little while he jumps up and says : 
.
Dah she is .
 
.
We’s safe , Huck , we’s safe .
 Jump up and crack yo’ heels .
 Dat’s de good ole Cairo at las’ , I jis knows it .
 
.
I says : 
.
I’ll take the canoe and go and see , Jim .
 It mightn’t be , you know .
 
.
I was paddling off , all in a sweat to tell on him .
 but when he says this , it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me .
 I went along slow then , and I warn’t right down certain whether I was glad I started or whether I warn’t .
 When I was fifty yards off , Jim says : 
.
What’s that yonder .
 
.
A piece of a raft ,  I says .
 
.
Do you belong on it .
 
.
Yes , sir .
 
.
Any men on it .
 
.
Only one , sir .
 
.
Well , there’s five niggers run off to-night up yonder , above the head of the bend .
 Is your man white or black .
 
.
I didn’t answer up prompt .
 I tried to , but the words wouldn’t come .
 I tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it , but I warn’t man enough—hadn’t the spunk of a rabbit .
 I see I was weakening .
 so I just give up trying , and up and says : 
.
He’s white .
 
.
I reckon we’ll go and see for ourselves .
 
.
Oh , the devil .
 we’re in a hurry , boy .
 But I s’pose we’ve got to .
 Come , buckle to your paddle , and let’s get along .
 
.
I buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars .
 When we had made a stroke or two , I says : 
.
Well , that’s infernal mean .
 Odd , too .
 Say , boy , what’s the matter with your father .
 
.
It’s the—a—the—well , it ain’t anything much .
 
.
They stopped pulling .
 It warn’t but a mighty little ways to the raft now .
 One says : 
.
Boy , that’s a lie .
 What IS the matter with your pap .
 Answer up square now , and it’ll be the better for you .
 
.
Set her back , John , set her back .
  says one .
 They backed water .
 Keep away , boy—keep to looard .
 Confound it , I just expect the wind has blowed it to us .
 Your pap’s got the small-pox , and you know it precious well .
 Why didn’t you come out and say so .
 Do you want to spread it all over .
 
.
Well ,  says I , a-blubbering , I’ve told everybody before , and they just went away and left us .
 
.
Good-bye , sir ,  says I .
 I won’t let no runaway niggers get by me if I can help it .
 
.
Jim .
 
.
Here I is , Huck .
 Is dey out o’ sight yit .
 Don’t talk loud .
 
.
He was in the river under the stern oar , with just his nose out .
 I told him they were out of sight , so he come aboard .
 He says : 
.
Then we talked about the money .
 It was a pretty good raise—twenty dollars apiece .
 Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat now , and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free States .
 He said twenty mile more warn’t far for the raft to go , but he wished we was already there .
 
.
That night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down in a left-hand bend .
 
.
I went off in the canoe to ask about it .
 Pretty soon I found a man out in the river with a skiff , setting a trot-line .
 I ranged up and says : 
.
Mister , is that town Cairo .
 
.
Cairo .
 no .
 You must be a blame’ fool .
 
.
What town is it , mister .
 
.
If you want to know , go and find out .
 If you stay here botherin’ around me for about a half a minute longer you’ll get something you won’t want .
 
.
Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night .
 
.
He says : 
.
Doan’ le’s talk about it , Huck .
 Po’ niggers can’t have no luck .
 I awluz ’spected dat rattlesnake-skin warn’t done wid its work .
 
.
It ain’t yo’ fault , Huck .
 you didn’ know .
 Don’t you blame yo’self ’bout it .
 
.
When it was daylight , here was the clear Ohio water inshore , sure enough , and outside was the old regular Muddy .
 So it was all up with Cairo .
 
.
We talked it all over .
 It wouldn’t do to take to the shore .
 we couldn’t take the raft up the stream , of course .
 There warn’t no way but to wait for dark , and start back in the canoe and take the chances .
 So we slept all day amongst the cottonwood thicket , so as to be fresh for the work , and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone .
 
.
So we shoved out after dark on the raft .
 
.
Anybody that don’t believe yet that it’s foolishness to handle a snake-skin , after all that that snake-skin done for us , will believe it now if they read on and see what more it done for us .
 
.
I sung out for Jim about a dozen times , but I didn’t get any answer .
 so I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was treading water ,  and struck out for shore , shoving it ahead of me .
 But I made out to see that the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore , which meant that I was in a crossing .
 so I changed off and went that way .
 
.
IN about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his head out , and says : 
.
Be done , boys .
 Who’s there .
 
.
I says : 
.
It’s me .
 
.
Who’s me .
 
.
George Jackson , sir .
 
.
What do you want .
 
.
I don’t want nothing , sir .
 I only want to go along by , but the dogs won’t let me .
 
.
What are you prowling around here this time of night for—hey .
 
.
Oh , you did , did you .
 Strike a light there , somebody .
 What did you say your name was .
 
.
George Jackson , sir .
 I’m only a boy .
 
.
No , sir , nobody .
 
.
I heard the people stirring around in the house now , and see a light .
 The man sung out : 
.
All ready .
 
.
Now , George Jackson , do you know the Shepherdsons .
 
.
No , sir .
 I never heard of them .
 
.
Why , bless you , Saul , the poor thing’s as wet as he can be .
 and don’t you reckon it may be he’s hungry .
 
.
True for you , Rachel—I forgot .
 
.
So the old lady says : 
.
Buck looked about as old as me—thirteen or fourteen or along there , though he was a little bigger than me .
 He hadn’t on anything but a shirt , and he was very frowzy-headed .
 He came in gaping and digging one fist into his eyes , and he was dragging a gun along with the other one .
 He says : 
.
Ain’t they no Shepherdsons around .
 
.
They said , no , ’twas a false alarm .
 
.
Well ,  he says , if they’d a ben some , I reckon I’d a got one .
 
.
They all laughed , and Bob says : 
.
Why , Buck , they might have scalped us all , you’ve been so slow in coming .
 
.
Well , guess ,  he says .
 
.
How’m I going to guess ,  says I , when I never heard tell of it before .
 
.
But you can guess , can’t you .
 It’s just as easy .
 
.
WHICH candle .
  I says .
 
.
Why , any candle ,  he says .
 
.
I don’t know where he was ,  says I .
 where was he .
 
.
Why , he was in the DARK .
 That’s where he was .
 
.
Well , if you knowed where he was , what did you ask me for .
 
.
Why , blame it , it’s a riddle , don’t you see .
 Say , how long are you going to stay here .
 You got to stay always .
 We can just have booming times—they don’t have no school now .
 Do you own a dog .
 I’ve got a dog—and he’ll go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in .
 Do you like to comb up Sundays , and all that kind of foolishness .
 You bet I don’t , but ma she makes me .
 Confound these ole britches .
 I reckon I’d better put ’em on , but I’d ruther not , it’s so warm .
 Are you all ready .
 All right .
 Come along , old hoss .
 
.
Can you spell , Buck .
 
.
Yes ,  he says .
 
.
I bet you can’t spell my name ,  says I .
 
.
I bet you what you dare I can ,  says he .
 
.
Well , there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock , made out of something like chalk , and painted up gaudy .
 By one of the parrots was a cat made of crockery , and a crockery dog by the other .
 and when you pressed down on them they squeaked , but didn’t open their mouths nor look different nor interested .
 They squeaked through underneath .
 There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out behind those things .
 On the table in the middle of the room was a kind of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it , which was much redder and yellower and prettier than real ones is , but they warn’t real because you could see where pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk , or whatever it was , underneath .

ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS , DEC’D
.
And did young Stephen sicken , 
.
And did young Stephen die .
 
.
And did the sad hearts thicken , 
.
And did the mourners cry .
 
.
No .
 such was not the fate of , 
.
Young Stephen Dowling Bots .
 
.
Though sad hearts round him thickened , 
.
’Twas not from sickness’ shots .
 
.
No whooping-cough did rack his frame , 
.
Nor measles drear with spots .
 
.
Not these impaired the sacred name , 
.
Of Stephen Dowling Bots .
 
.
Despised love struck not with woe , 
.
That head of curly knots .
 
.
Nor stomach troubles laid him low , 
.
Young Stephen Dowling Bots .
 
.
O no .
 Then list with tearful eye , 
.
Whilst I his fate do tell .
 
.
His soul did from this cold world fly , 
.
By falling down a well .
 
.
They got him out and emptied him .
 
.
Alas it was too late .
 
.
His spirit was gone for to sport aloft , 
.
In the realms of the good and great .
 
.
Then there was Miss Charlotte .
 she was twenty-five , and tall and proud and grand , but as good as she could be when she warn’t stirred up .
 but when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks , like her father .
 She was beautiful .
 
.
So was her sister , Miss Sophia , but it was a different kind .
 She was gentle and sweet like a dove , and she was only twenty .
 
.
There was another clan of aristocracy around there—five or six families—mostly of the name of Shepherdson .
 They was as high-toned and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords .
 The Shepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing , which was about two mile above our house .
 so sometimes when I went up there with a lot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons there on their fine horses .
 
.
One day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting , and heard a horse coming .
 We was crossing the road .
 Buck says : 
.
Quick .
 Jump for the woods .
 
.
I don’t like that shooting from behind a bush .
 Why didn’t you step into the road , my boy .
 
.
The Shepherdsons don’t , father .
 They always take advantage .
 
.
Soon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees by ourselves , I says : 
.
Did you want to kill him , Buck .
 
.
Well , I bet I did .
 
.
Him .
 He never done nothing to me .
 
.
Well , then , what did you want to kill him for .
 
.
Why , nothing—only it’s on account of the feud .
 
.
What’s a feud .
 
.
Never heard of it before—tell me about it .
 
.
Has this one been going on long , Buck .
 
.
Well , I should RECKON .
 It started thirty year ago , or som’ers along there .
 There was trouble ’bout something , and then a lawsuit to settle it .
 and the suit went agin one of the men , and so he up and shot the man that won the suit—which he would naturally do , of course .
 Anybody would .
 
.
What was the trouble about , Buck .
 —land .
 
.
I reckon maybe—I don’t know .
 
.
Well , who done the shooting .
 Was it a Grangerford or a Shepherdson .
 
.
Laws , how do I know .
 It was so long ago .
 
.
Don’t anybody know .
 
.
Oh , yes , pa knows , I reckon , and some of the other old people .
 but they don’t know now what the row was about in the first place .
 
.
Has there been many killed , Buck .
 
.
Has anybody been killed this year , Buck .
 
.
I reckon that old man was a coward , Buck .
 
.
I reckon he WARN’T a coward .
 Not by a blame’ sight .
 There ain’t a coward amongst them Shepherdsons—not a one .
 And there ain’t no cowards amongst the Grangerfords either .
 Why , that old man kep’ up his end in a fight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords , and come out winner .
 They was all a-horseback .
 he lit off of his horse and got behind a little woodpile , and kep’ his horse before him to stop the bullets .
 but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around the old man , and peppered away at him , and he peppered away at them .
 Him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled , but the Grangerfords had to be FETCHED home—and one of ’em was dead , and another died the next day .
 No , sir .
 if a body’s out hunting for cowards he don’t want to fool away any time amongst them Shepherdsons , becuz they don’t breed any of that KIND .
 
.
Mars Jawge , if you’ll come down into de swamp I’ll show you a whole stack o’ water-moccasins .
 
.
Why didn’t you tell my Jack to fetch me here sooner , Jim .
 
.
WHAT raft , Jim .
 
.
Our ole raf’ .
 
.
You mean to say our old raft warn’t smashed all to flinders .
 
.
Why , how did you get hold of the raft again , Jim—did you catch her .
 
.
What’s it all about .
 
.
Says he : 
.
Don’t you know , Mars Jawge .
 
.
Buck went off ’thout waking me up .
 
.
Well , I reck’n he DID .
 Dey warn’t gwyne to mix you up in it .
 Mars Buck he loaded up his gun en ’lowed he’s gwyne to fetch home a Shepherdson or bust .
 Well , dey’ll be plenty un ’m dah , I reck’n , en you bet you he’ll fetch one ef he gits a chanst .
 
.
I took up the river road as hard as I could put .
 By and by I begin to hear guns a good ways off .
 When I came in sight of the log store and the woodpile where the steamboats lands I worked along under the trees and brush till I got to a good place , and then I clumb up into the forks of a cottonwood that was out of reach , and watched .
 There was a wood-rank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree , and first I was going to hide behind that .
 but maybe it was luckier I didn’t .
 
.
There was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open place before the log store , cussing and yelling , and trying to get at a couple of young chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside of the steamboat landing .
 but they couldn’t come it .
 Every time one of them showed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at .
 The two boys was squatting back to back behind the pile , so they could watch both ways .
 
.
The men ripped around awhile , and then rode away .
 As soon as they was out of sight I sung out to Buck and told him .
 He didn’t know what to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first .
 He was awful surprised .
 He told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the men come in sight again .
 said they was up to some devilment or other—wouldn’t be gone long .
 I wished I was out of that tree , but I dasn’t come down .
 Buck begun to cry and rip , and ’lowed that him and his cousin Joe that was the other young chap would make up for this day yet .
 He said his father and his two brothers was killed , and two or three of the enemy .
 Said the Shepherdsons laid for them in ambush .
 Buck said his father and brothers ought to waited for their relations—the Shepherdsons was too strong for them .
 I asked him what was become of young Harney and Miss Sophia .
 He said they’d got across the river and was safe .
 I was glad of that .
 but the way Buck did take on because he didn’t manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him—I hain’t ever heard anything like it .
 
.
I stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark , afraid to come down .
 Sometimes I heard guns away off in the woods .
 and twice I seen little gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns .
 so I reckoned the trouble was still a-going on .
 I was mighty downhearted .
 so I made up my mind I wouldn’t ever go anear that house again , because I reckoned I was to blame , somehow .
 I judged that that piece of paper meant that Miss Sophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half-past two and run off .
 and I judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way she acted , and then maybe he would a locked her up , and this awful mess wouldn’t ever happened .
 
.
Good lan’ .
 is dat you , honey .
 Doan’ make no noise .
 
.
I says : 
.
No .
 spirits wouldn’t say , ’Dern the dern fog .
 ’
.
Don’t you do it .
 I don’t hear the dogs and horses yet .
 you’ve got time to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways .
 then you take to the water and wade down to me and get in—that’ll throw the dogs off the scent .
 
.
What got you into trouble .
  says the baldhead to t’other chap .
 
.
I ain’t undisposed .
 What’s your line—mainly .
 
.
I’ve done considerble in the doctoring way in my time .
 Layin’ on o’ hands is my best holt—for cancer and paralysis , and sich things .
 and I k’n tell a fortune pretty good when I’ve got somebody along to find out the facts for me .
 Preachin’s my line , too , and workin’ camp-meetin’s , and missionaryin’ around .
 
.
Nobody never said anything for a while .
 then the young man hove a sigh and says : 
.
Alas .
 
.
What ’re you alassin’ about .
  says the bald-head .
 
.
To think I should have lived to be leading such a life , and be degraded down into such company .
  And he begun to wipe the corner of his eye with a rag .
 
.
Drot your pore broken heart ,  says the baldhead .
 what are you heaving your pore broken heart at US f’r .
 WE hain’t done nothing .
 
.
Brought you down from whar .
 Whar was you brought down from .
 
.
Jim’s eyes bugged out when he heard that .
 and I reckon mine did , too .
 Then the baldhead says : No .
 you can’t mean it .
 
.
Jim pitied him ever so much , and so did I .
 We tried to comfort him , but he said it warn’t much use , he couldn’t be much comforted .
 said if we was a mind to acknowledge him , that would do him more good than most anything else .
 so we said we would , if he would tell us how .
 He said we ought to bow when we spoke to him , and say Your Grace ,  or My Lord ,  or Your Lordship"—and he wouldn’t mind it if we called him plain Bridgewater ,  which , he said , was a title anyway , and not a name .
 and one of us ought to wait on him at dinner , and do any little thing for him he wanted done .
 
.
No .
 
.
No you ain’t .
 You ain’t the only person that’s ben snaked down wrongfully out’n a high place .
 
.
Alas .
 
.
No , you ain’t the only person that’s had a secret of his birth .
  And , by jings , HE begins to cry .
 
.
Hold .
 What do you mean .
 
.
Bilgewater , kin I trust you .
  says the old man , still sort of sobbing .
 
.
To the bitter death .
  He took the old man by the hand and squeezed it , and says , That secret of your being : speak .
 
.
Bilgewater , I am the late Dauphin .
 
.
You bet you , Jim and me stared this time .
 Then the duke says : 
.
You are what .
 
.
You .
 At your age .
 No .
 You mean you’re the late Charlemagne .
 you must be six or seven hundred years old , at the very least .
 
.
Trouble has done it , Bilgewater , trouble has done it .
 trouble has brung these gray hairs and this premature balditude .
 Yes , gentlemen , you see before you , in blue jeans and misery , the wanderin’ , exiled , trampled-on , and sufferin’ rightful King of France .
 
.
The duke done it , and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it .
 It took away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it , because it would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the raft .
 for what you want , above all things , on a raft , is for everybody to be satisfied , and feel right and kind towards the others .
 
.
It didn’t take me long to make up my mind that these liars warn’t no kings nor dukes at all , but just low-down humbugs and frauds .
 But I never said nothing , never let on .
 kept it to myself .
 it’s the best way .
 then you don’t have no quarrels , and don’t get into no trouble .
 If they wanted us to call them kings and dukes , I hadn’t no objections , ’long as it would keep peace in the family .
 and it warn’t no use to tell Jim , so I didn’t tell him .
 If I never learnt nothing else out of pap , I learnt that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them have their own way .
 
.
THEY asked us considerable many questions .
 wanted to know what we covered up the raft that way for , and laid by in the daytime instead of running—was Jim a runaway nigger .
 Says I : 
.
Goodness sakes .
 would a runaway nigger run SOUTH .
 
.
No , they allowed he wouldn’t .
 I had to account for things some way , so I says : 
.
The duke says : 
.
Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we want to .
 I’ll think the thing over—I’ll invent a plan that’ll fix it .
 We’ll let it alone for to-day , because of course we don’t want to go by that town yonder in daylight—it mightn’t be healthy .
 
.
I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that a corn-shuck bed warn’t just fitten for me to sleep on .
 Your Grace ’ll take the shuck bed yourself .
 
.
Jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute , being afraid there was going to be some more trouble amongst them .
 so we was pretty glad when the duke says : 
.
I had the middle watch , you know , but I was pretty sleepy by that time , so Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me .
 he was always mighty good that way , Jim was .
 I crawled into the wigwam , but the king and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn’t no show for me .
 so I laid outside—I didn’t mind the rain , because it was warm , and the waves warn’t running so high now .
 About two they come up again , though , and Jim was going to call me .
 but he changed his mind , because he reckoned they warn’t high enough yet to do any harm .
 but he was mistaken about that , for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a regular ripper and washed me overboard .
 It most killed Jim a-laughing .
 He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was , anyway .
 
.
I took the watch , and Jim he laid down and snored away .
 and by and by the storm let up for good and all .
 and the first cabin-light that showed I rousted him out , and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the day .
 
.
But the histrionic muse is the darling .
 Have you ever trod the boards , Royalty .
 
.
No ,  says the king .
 
.
Easy .
 
.
All right .
 I’m jist a-freezn’ for something fresh , anyway .
 Le’s commence right away .
 
.
There was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend , and after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run in daylight without it being dangersome for Jim .
 so he allowed he would go down to the town and fix that thing .
 The king allowed he would go , too , and see if he couldn’t strike something .
 We was out of coffee , so Jim said I better go along with them in the canoe and get some .
 
.
The duke said what he was after was a printing-office .
 We found it .
 a little bit of a concern , up over a carpenter shop—carpenters and printers all gone to the meeting , and no doors locked .
 It was a dirty , littered-up place , and had ink marks , and handbills with pictures of horses and runaway niggers on them , all over the walls .
 The duke shed his coat and said he was all right now .
 So me and the king lit out for the camp-meeting .
 
.
The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds , only they was bigger and held crowds of people .
 The benches was made out of outside slabs of logs , with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into for legs .
 They didn’t have no backs .
 The preachers had high platforms to stand on at one end of the sheds .
 The women had on sun-bonnets .
 and some had linsey-woolsey frocks , some gingham ones , and a few of the young ones had on calico .
 Some of the young men was barefooted , and some of the children didn’t have on any clothes but just a tow-linen shirt .
 Some of the old women was knitting , and some of the young folks was courting on the sly .
 
.
Oh , come to the mourners’ bench .
 come , black with sin .
 AMEN .
  come , sick and sore .
 AMEN .
  come , lame and halt and blind .
 AMEN .
  come , pore and needy , sunk in shame .
 A-A-MEN .
  come , all that’s worn and soiled and suffering .
 —come with a broken spirit .
 come with a contrite heart .
 Come in your rags and sin and dirt .
 the waters that cleanse is free , the door of heaven stands open—oh , enter in and be at rest .
  A-A-MEN .
 GLORY , GLORY HALLELUJAH .
 
.
And then he busted into tears , and so did everybody .
 Then somebody sings out , Take up a collection for him , take up a collection .
  Well , a half a dozen made a jump to do it , but somebody sings out , Let HIM pass the hat around .
  Then everybody said it , the preacher too .
 
.
So the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes , and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being so good to the poor pirates away off there .
 and every little while the prettiest kind of girls , with the tears running down their cheeks , would up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by .
 and he always done it .
 and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or six times—and he was invited to stay a week .
 and everybody wanted him to live in their houses , and said they’d think it was an honor .
 but he said as this was the last day of the camp-meeting he couldn’t do no good , and besides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to work on the pirates .
 
.
We all said the duke was pretty smart , and there couldn’t be no trouble about running daytimes .
 We judged we could make miles enough that night to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke’s work in the printing office was going to make in that little town .
 then we could boom right along if we wanted to .
 
.
We laid low and kept still , and never shoved out till nearly ten o’clock .
 then we slid by , pretty wide away from the town , and didn’t hoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it .
 
.
When Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning , he says : 
.
Huck , does you reck’n we gwyne to run acrost any mo’ kings on dis trip .
 
.
I found Jim had been trying to get him to talk French , so he could hear what it was like .
 but he said he had been in this country so long , and had so much trouble , he’d forgot it .
 
.
Well , next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out of oak laths , and begun to practice the sword fight—the duke called himself Richard III .
 .
 and the way they laid on and pranced around the raft was grand to see .
 But by and by the king tripped and fell overboard , and after that they took a rest , and had a talk about all kinds of adventures they’d had in other times along the river .
 
.
After dinner the duke says : 
.
Well , Capet , we’ll want to make this a first-class show , you know , so I guess we’ll add a little more to it .
 We want a little something to answer encores with , anyway .
 
.
What’s onkores , Bilgewater .
 
.
The duke told him , and then says : 
.
I’ll answer by doing the Highland fling or the sailor’s hornpipe .
 and you—well , let me see—oh , I’ve got it—you can do Hamlet’s soliloquy .
 
.
Hamlet’s which .
 
.
So he went to marching up and down , thinking , and frowning horrible every now and then .
 then he would hoist up his eyebrows .
 next he would squeeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan .
 next he would sigh , and next he’d let on to drop a tear .
 It was beautiful to see him .
 By and by he got it .
 He told us to give attention .
 Then he strikes a most noble attitude , with one leg shoved forwards , and his arms stretched away up , and his head tilted back , looking up at the sky .
 and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth .
 and after that , all through his speech , he howled , and spread around , and swelled up his chest , and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever I see before .
 This is the speech—I learned it , easy enough , while he was learning it to the king : 
.
To be , or not to be .
 that is the bare bodkin That makes calamity of so long life .
 For who would fardels bear , till Birnam Wood do come to Dunsinane , But that the fear of something after death Murders the innocent sleep , Great nature’s second course , And makes us rather sling the arrows of outrageous fortune Than fly to others that we know not of .
 There’s the respect must give us pause : Wake Duncan with thy knocking .
 I would thou couldst .
 For who would bear the whips and scorns of time , The oppressor’s wrong , the proud man’s contumely , The law’s delay , and the quietus which his pangs might take , In the dead waste and middle of the night , when churchyards yawn In customary suits of solemn black , But that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns , Breathes forth contagion on the world , And thus the native hue of resolution , like the poor cat i’ the adage , Is sicklied o’er with care , And all the clouds that lowered o’er our housetops , With this regard their currents turn awry , And lose the name of action .
 ’Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished .
 But soft you , the fair Ophelia : Ope not thy ponderous and marble jaws , But get thee to a nunnery—go .
 
.
Well , the old man he liked that speech , and he mighty soon got it so he could do it first-rate .
 It seemed like he was just born for it .
 and when he had his hand in and was excited , it was perfectly lovely the way he would rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it off .

Then we went loafing around town .
 The stores and houses was most all old , shackly , dried up frame concerns that hadn’t ever been painted .
 they was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts , so as to be out of reach of the water when the river was over-flowed .
 The houses had little gardens around them , but they didn’t seem to raise hardly anything in them but jimpson-weeds , and sunflowers , and ash piles , and old curled-up boots and shoes , and pieces of bottles , and rags , and played-out tinware .
 The fences was made of different kinds of boards , nailed on at different times .
 and they leaned every which way , and had gates that didn’t generly have but one hinge—a leather one .
 Some of the fences had been white-washed some time or another , but the duke said it was in Clumbus’ time , like enough .
 There was generly hogs in the garden , and people driving them out .
 
.
Gimme a chaw ’v tobacker , Hank .
 
.
Well , I DID pay you back some of it wunst .
 
.
Yes , you did—’bout six chaws .
 You borry’d store tobacker and paid back nigger-head .
 
.
Store tobacco is flat black plug , but these fellows mostly chaws the natural leaf twisted .
 When they borrow a chaw they don’t generly cut it off with a knife , but set the plug in between their teeth , and gnaw with their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in two .
 then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it when it’s handed back , and says , sarcastic : 
.
All the loafers looked glad .
 I reckoned they was used to having fun out of Boggs .
 One of them says : 
.
Wonder who he’s a-gwyne to chaw up this time .
 If he’d a-chawed up all the men he’s ben a-gwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year he’d have considerable ruputation now .
 
.
Boggs comes a-tearing along on his horse , whooping and yelling like an Injun , and singing out : 
.
Cler the track , thar .
 I’m on the waw-path , and the price uv coffins is a-gwyne to raise .
 
.
He see me , and rode up and says : 
.
Whar’d you come f’m , boy .
 You prepared to die .
 
.
Then he rode on .
 I was scared , but a man says : 
.
He don’t mean nothing .
 he’s always a-carryin’ on like that when he’s drunk .
 He’s the best naturedest old fool in Arkansaw—never hurt nobody , drunk nor sober .
 
.
Come out here , Sherburn .
 Come out and meet the man you’ve swindled .
 You’re the houn’ I’m after , and I’m a-gwyne to have you , too .
 
.
I’m tired of this , but I’ll endure it till one o’clock .
 Till one o’clock , mind—no longer .
 If you open your mouth against me only once after that time you can’t travel so far but I will find you .
 
.
Go for his daughter .
 —quick , go for his daughter .
 sometimes he’ll listen to her .
 If anybody can persuade him , she can .
 
.
So somebody started on a run .
 I walked down street a ways and stopped .
 In about five or ten minutes here comes Boggs again , but not on his horse .
 He was a-reeling across the street towards me , bare-headed , with a friend on both sides of him a-holt of his arms and hurrying him along .
 He was quiet , and looked uneasy .
 and he warn’t hanging back any , but was doing some of the hurrying himself .
 Somebody sings out : 
.
Boggs .
 
.
Colonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground , and turned around on his heels and walked off .
 
.
Well , by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched .
 In about a minute everybody was saying it .
 so away they went , mad and yelling , and snatching down every clothes-line they come to to do the hanging with .
 
.
Sherburn never said a word—just stood there , looking down .
 The stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable .
 Sherburn run his eye slow along the crowd .
 and wherever it struck the people tried a little to out-gaze him , but they couldn’t .
 they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky .
 Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed .
 not the pleasant kind , but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread that’s got sand in it .
 
.
Then he says , slow and scornful : 
.
The idea of YOU lynching anybody .
 It’s amusing .
 The idea of you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a MAN .
 Because you’re brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come along here , did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a MAN .
 Why , a MAN’S safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind—as long as it’s daytime and you’re not behind him .
 
.
So they always acquit .
 and then a MAN goes in the night , with a hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal .
 Your mistake is , that you didn’t bring a man with you .
 that’s one mistake , and the other is that you didn’t come in the dark and fetch your masks .
 You brought PART of a man—Buck Harkness , there—and if you hadn’t had him to start you , you’d a taken it out in blowing .
 
.
Well , that night we had OUR show .
 but there warn’t only about twelve people there—just enough to pay expenses .
 And they laughed all the time , and that made the duke mad .
 and everybody left , anyway , before the show was over , but one boy which was asleep .
 So the duke said these Arkansaw lunkheads couldn’t come up to Shakespeare .
 what they wanted was low comedy—and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy , he reckoned .
 He said he could size their style .
 So next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint , and drawed off some handbills , and stuck them up all over the village .
 The bills said : 
.
AT THE COURT HOUSE .
 FOR 3 NIGHTS ONLY .
 
.
The World-Renowned Tragedians
.
DAVID GARRICK THE YOUNGER .
 
.
AND EDMUND KEAN THE ELDER .
 
.
Of the London and
.
Continental Theatres , 
.
In their Thrilling Tragedy of
.
THE KING’S CAMELEOPARD , 
.
OR THE ROYAL NONESUCH .
 .
 .
 
.
Admission 50 cents .
 
.
LADIES AND CHILDREN NOT ADMITTED .
 
.
Twenty people sings out : 
.
The duke says yes .
 Then there was a fine time .
 Everybody sings out , Sold .
  and rose up mad , and was a-going for that stage and them tragedians .
 But a big , fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts : 
.
The third night the house was crammed again—and they warn’t new-comers this time , but people that was at the show the other two nights .
 I stood by the duke at the door , and I see that every man that went in had his pockets bulging , or something muffled up under his coat—and I see it warn’t no perfumery , neither , not by a long sight .
 I smelt sickly eggs by the barrel , and rotten cabbages , and such things .
 and if I know the signs of a dead cat being around , and I bet I do , there was sixty-four of them went in .
 I shoved in there for a minute , but it was too various for me .
 I couldn’t stand it .
 Well , when the place couldn’t hold no more people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for him a minute , and then he started around for the stage door , I after him .
 but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says : 
.
Walk fast now till you get away from the houses , and then shin for the raft like the dickens was after you .
 
.
Well , how’d the old thing pan out this time , duke .
  He hadn’t been up-town at all .
 
.
Them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in that three nights .
 I never see money hauled in by the wagon-load like that before .
 By and by , when they was asleep and snoring , Jim says : 
.
Don’t it s’prise you de way dem kings carries on , Huck .
 
.
No ,  I says , it don’t .
 
.
Why don’t it , Huck .
 
.
Is dat so .
 
.
But dis one do SMELL so like de nation , Huck .
 
.
Well , they all do , Jim .
 We can’t help the way a king smells .
 history don’t tell no way .
 
.
Now de duke , he’s a tolerble likely man in some ways .
 
.
Yes , a duke’s different .
 But not very different .
 This one’s a middling hard lot for a duke .
 When he’s drunk there ain’t no near-sighted man could tell him from a king .
 
.
Well , anyways , I doan’ hanker for no mo’ un um , Huck .
 Dese is all I kin stan’ .
 
.
It’s the way I feel , too , Jim .
 But we’ve got them on our hands , and we got to remember what they are , and make allowances .
 Sometimes I wish we could hear of a country that’s out of kings .
 
.
What was the use to tell Jim these warn’t real kings and dukes .
 It wouldn’t a done no good .
 and , besides , it was just as I said : you couldn’t tell them from the real kind .
 
.
’Shet de do’ .
 ’
.
’Doan’ you hear me .
 Shet de do’ .
 ’
.
She jis stood de same way , kiner smilin’ up .
 I was a-bilin’ .
 I says : 
.
’I lay I MAKE you mine .
 ’
.
Sick Arab—but harmless when not out of his head .
 
.
For the steamboat .
 going to Orleans .
 
.
Git aboard ,  says the king .
 Hold on a minute , my servant ’ll he’p you with them bags .
 Jump out and he’p the gentleman , Adolphus"—meaning me , I see .
 
.
Did anybody send ’em word .
 
.
Oh , yes .
 a month or two ago , when Peter was first took .
 because Peter said then that he sorter felt like he warn’t going to get well this time .
 You see , he was pretty old , and George’s g’yirls was too young to be much company for him , except Mary Jane , the red-headed one .
 and so he was kinder lonesome after George and his wife died , and didn’t seem to care much to live .
 He most desperately wanted to see Harvey—and William , too , for that matter—because he was one of them kind that can’t bear to make a will .
 He left a letter behind for Harvey , and said he’d told in it where his money was hid , and how he wanted the rest of the property divided up so George’s g’yirls would be all right—for George didn’t leave nothing .
 And that letter was all they could get him to put a pen to .
 
.
Why do you reckon Harvey don’t come .
 Wher’ does he live .
 
.
Yes , but that ain’t only a part of it .
 I’m going in a ship , next Wednesday , for Ryo Janeero , where my uncle lives .
 
.
Poor things .
 to be left alone in the cold world so .
 
.
Well , they could be worse off .
 Old Peter had friends , and they ain’t going to let them come to no harm .
 There’s Hobson , the Babtis’ preacher .
 and Deacon Lot Hovey , and Ben Rucker , and Abner Shackleford , and Levi Bell , the lawyer .
 and Dr .
 Robinson , and their wives , and the widow Bartley , and—well , there’s a lot of them .
 but these are the ones that Peter was thickest with , and used to write about sometimes , when he wrote home .
 so Harvey ’ll know where to look for friends when he gets here .
 
.
What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for .
 
.
Because she’s a big Orleans boat , and I was afeard she mightn’t stop there .
 When they’re deep they won’t stop for a hail .
 A Cincinnati boat will , but this is a StLouis one .
 
.
Was Peter Wilks well off .
 
.
Oh , yes , pretty well off .
 He had houses and land , and it’s reckoned he left three or four thousand in cash hid up som’ers .
 
.
When did you say he died .
 
.
Funeral to-morrow , likely .
 
.
Yes , ’bout the middle of the day .
 
.
Well , it’s all terrible sad .
 but we’ve all got to go , one time or another .
 So what we want to do is to be prepared .
 then we’re all right .
 
.
Yes , sir , it’s the best way .
 Ma used to always say that .
 
.
Now hustle back , right off , and fetch the duke up here , and the new carpet-bags .
 And if he’s gone over to t’other side , go over there and git him .
 And tell him to git himself up regardless .
 Shove along , now .
 
.
How are you on the deef and dumb , Bilgewater .
 
.
The duke said , leave him alone for that .
 said he had played a deef and dumb person on the histronic boards .
 So then they waited for a steamboat .
 
.
About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along , but they didn’t come from high enough up the river .
 but at last there was a big one , and they hailed her .
 She sent out her yawl , and we went aboard , and she was from Cincinnati .
 and when they found we only wanted to go four or five mile they was booming mad , and gave us a cussing , and said they wouldn’t land us .
 But the king was ca’m .
 He says : 
.
If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and put off in a yawl , a steamboat kin afford to carry ’em , can’t it .
 
.
Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher’ MrPeter Wilks lives .
  they give a glance at one another , and nodded their heads , as much as to say , What d’ I tell you .
  Then one of them says , kind of soft and gentle : 
.
I’m sorry sir , but the best we can do is to tell you where he DID live yesterday evening .
 
.
Is it THEM .
 
.
And somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say : 
.
You bet it is .
 
.
Then the king begins to work his jaw again , and says how him and his nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the family would take supper here with them this evening , and help set up with the ashes of the diseased .
 and says if his poor brother laying yonder could speak he knows who he would name , for they was names that was very dear to him , and mentioned often in his letters .
 and so he will name the same , to wit , as follows , vizz .
 : —Rev .
 MrHobson , and Deacon Lot Hovey , and MrBen Rucker , and Abner Shackleford , and Levi Bell , and Dr .
 Robinson , and their wives , and the widow Bartley .
 
.
Oh , THIS ain’t bully nor noth’n .
 Oh , no , I reckon not .
 Why , Billy , it beats the Nonesuch , DON’T it .
 
.
The duke allowed it did .
 They pawed the yaller-boys , and sifted them through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor .
 and the king says : 
.
It ain’t no use talkin’ .
 bein’ brothers to a rich dead man and representatives of furrin heirs that’s got left is the line for you and me , Bilge .
 Thish yer comes of trust’n to Providence .
 It’s the best way , in the long run .
 I’ve tried ’em all , and ther’ ain’t no better way .
 
.
Most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile , and took it on trust .
 but no , they must count it .
 So they counts it , and it comes out four hundred and fifteen dollars short .
 Says the king : 
.
Dern him , I wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen dollars .
 
.
They worried over that awhile , and ransacked all around for it .
 Then the duke says : 
.
It most busted them , but they made up the six thousand clean and clear .
 
.
When we got up-stairs everybody gethered around the table , and the king he counted it and stacked it up , three hundred dollars in a pile—twenty elegant little piles .
 Everybody looked hungry at it , and licked their chops .
 Then they raked it into the bag again , and I see the king begin to swell himself up for another speech .
 He says : 
.
You DEAR good souls .
 —how LOVELY .
 —how COULD you .
 
.
And so he went a-mooning on and on , liking to hear himself talk , and every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again , till the duke he couldn’t stand it no more .
 so he writes on a little scrap of paper , OBSEQUIES , you old fool ,  and folds it up , and goes to goo-gooing and reaching it over people’s heads to him .
 The king he reads it and puts it in his pocket , and says : 
.
Then he weaves along again , perfectly ca’m , and goes to dropping in his funeral orgies again every now and then , just like he done before .
 And when he done it the third time he says : 
.
The king he smiled eager , and shoved out his flapper , and says : 
.
Well , how they all took on .
 They crowded around the doctor and tried to quiet him down , and tried to explain to him and tell him how Harvey ’d showed in forty ways that he WAS Harvey , and knowed everybody by name , and the names of the very dogs , and begged and BEGGED him not to hurt Harvey’s feelings and the poor girl’s feelings , and all that .
 But it warn’t no use .
 he stormed right along , and said any man that pretended to be an Englishman and couldn’t imitate the lingo no better than what he did was a fraud and a liar .
 The poor girls was hanging to the king and crying .
 and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on THEM .
 He says : 
.
All right .
 I wash MY hands of the matter .
 But I warn you all that a time ’s coming when you’re going to feel sick whenever you think of this day .
  And away he went .
 
.
All right , doctor ,  says the king , kinder mocking him .
 we’ll try and get ’em to send for you .
  which made them all laugh , and they said it was a prime good hit .
 
.
And when it was all done me and the hare-lip had supper in the kitchen off of the leavings , whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up the things .
 The hare-lip she got to pumping me about England , and blest if I didn’t think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes .
 She says : 
.
Did you ever see the king .
 
.
Who .
 William Fourth .
 Well , I bet I have—he goes to our church .
  I knowed he was dead years ago , but I never let on .
 So when I says he goes to our church , she says : 
.
Yes—regular .
 His pew’s right over opposite ourn—on t’other side the pulpit .
 
.
I thought he lived in London .
 
.
Well , he does .
 Where WOULD he live .
 
.
But I thought YOU lived in Sheffield .
 
.
I see I was up a stump .
 I had to let on to get choked with a chicken bone , so as to get time to think how to get down again .
 Then I says : 
.
I mean he goes to our church regular when he’s in Sheffield .
 That’s only in the summer time , when he comes there to take the sea baths .
 
.
Well , who said it was .
 
.
Why , you did .
 
.
I DIDN’T nuther .
 
.
You did .
 
.
I didn’t .
 
.
You did .
 
.
I never said nothing of the kind .
 
.
Well , what DID you say , then .
 
.
Said he come to take the sea BATHS—that’s what I said .
 
.
Well , then , how’s he going to take the sea baths if it ain’t on the sea .
 
.
Looky here ,  I says .
 did you ever see any Congress-water .
 
.
Yes .
 
.
Well , did you have to go to Congress to get it .
 
.
Why , no .
 
.
Well , neither does William Fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea bath .
 
.
How does he get it , then .
 
.
Oh , I see , now .
 You might a said that in the first place and saved time .
 
.
Do you go to church , too .
 
.
Yes—regular .
 
.
Where do you set .
 
.
Why , in our pew .
 
.
WHOSE pew .
 
.
His’n .
 What does HE want with a pew .
 
.
Wants it to set in .
 What did you RECKON he wanted with it .
 
.
Why , I thought he’d be in the pulpit .
 
.
Rot him , I forgot he was a preacher .
 I see I was up a stump again , so I played another chicken bone and got another think .
 Then I says : 
.
Blame it , do you suppose there ain’t but one preacher to a church .
 
.
Why , what do they want with more .
 
.
What .
 —to preach before a king .
 I never did see such a girl as you .
 They don’t have no less than seventeen .
 
.
Seventeen .
 My land .
 Why , I wouldn’t set out such a string as that , not if I NEVER got to glory .
 It must take ’em a week .
 
.
Shucks , they don’t ALL of ’em preach the same day—only ONE of ’em .
 
.
Well , then , what does the rest of ’em do .
 
.
Oh , nothing much .
 Loll around , pass the plate—and one thing or another .
 But mainly they don’t do nothing .
 
.
Well , then , what are they FOR .
 
.
Why , they’re for STYLE .
 Don’t you know nothing .
 
.
Well , I don’t WANT to know no such foolishness as that .
 How is servants treated in England .
 Do they treat ’em better ’n we treat our niggers .
 
.
NO .
 A servant ain’t nobody there .
 They treat them worse than dogs .
 
.
Oh , just listen .
 A body could tell YOU hain’t ever been to England by that .
 Why , Hare-l—why , Joanna , they never see a holiday from year’s end to year’s end .
 never go to the circus , nor theater , nor nigger shows , nor nowheres .
 
.
Nor church .
 
.
Nor church .
 
.
But YOU always went to church .
 
.
Honest injun , now , hain’t you been telling me a lot of lies .
 
.
Honest injun ,  says I .
 
.
None of it at all .
 
.
None of it at all .
 Not a lie in it ,  says I .
 
.
Lay your hand on this book and say it .
 
.
I see it warn’t nothing but a dictionary , so I laid my hand on it and said it .
 So then she looked a little better satisfied , and says : 
.
Well , then , I’ll believe some of it .
 but I hope to gracious if I’ll believe the rest .
 
.
What is it you won’t believe , Joe .
  says Mary Jane , stepping in with Susan behind her .
 It ain’t right nor kind for you to talk so to him , and him a stranger and so far from his people .
 How would you like to be treated so .
 
.
That’s always your way , Maim—always sailing in to help somebody before they’re hurt .
 I hain’t done nothing to him .
 He’s told some stretchers , I reckon , and I said I wouldn’t swallow it all .
 and that’s every bit and grain I DID say .
 I reckon he can stand a little thing like that , can’t he .
 
.
It don’t make no difference what he SAID—that ain’t the thing .
 The thing is for you to treat him KIND , and not be saying things to make him remember he ain’t in his own country and amongst his own folks .
 
.
I says to myself , THIS is a girl that I’m letting that old reptle rob her of her money .
 
.
Says I to myself , and this is ANOTHER one that I’m letting him rob her of her money .
 
.
All right , then ,  says the other girls .
 you just ask his pardon .
 
.
So , thinks I , I’ll go and search them rooms .
 Upstairs the hall was dark , but I found the duke’s room , and started to paw around it with my hands .
 but I recollected it wouldn’t be much like the king to let anybody else take care of that money but his own self .
 so then I went to his room and begun to paw around there .
 But I see I couldn’t do nothing without a candle , and I dasn’t light one , of course .
 So I judged I’d got to do the other thing—lay for them and eavesdrop .
 About that time I hears their footsteps coming , and was going to skip under the bed .
 I reached for it , but it wasn’t where I thought it would be .
 but I touched the curtain that hid Mary Jane’s frocks , so I jumped in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns , and stood there perfectly still .
 
.
Well , what is it .
 And cut it middlin’ short , because it’s better for us to be down there a-whoopin’ up the mournin’ than up here givin’ ’em a chance to talk us over .
 
.
What is it , duke .
 
.
That we better glide out of this before three in the morning , and clip it down the river with what we’ve got .
 Specially , seeing we got it so easy—GIVEN back to us , flung at our heads , as you may say , when of course we allowed to have to steal it back .
 I’m for knocking off and lighting out .
 
.
What .
 And not sell out the rest o’ the property .
 March off like a passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous’n’ dollars’ worth o’ property layin’ around jest sufferin’ to be scooped in .
 —and all good , salable stuff , too .
 
.
Well , the king he talked him blind .
 so at last he give in , and said all right , but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay , and that doctor hanging over them .
 But the king says : 
.
Cuss the doctor .
 What do we k’yer for HIM .
 Hain’t we got all the fools in town on our side .
 And ain’t that a big enough majority in any town .
 
.
So they got ready to go down stairs again .
 The duke says : 
.
I don’t think we put that money in a good place .
 
.
Why .
 
.
Because Mary Jane ’ll be in mourning from this out .
 and first you know the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds up and put ’em away .
 and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and not borrow some of it .
 
.
But I knowed better .
 I had it out of there before they was half-way down stairs .
 I groped along up to my cubby , and hid it there till I could get a chance to do better .
 I judged I better hide it outside of the house somewheres , because if they missed it they would give the house a good ransacking : I knowed that very well .
 Then I turned in , with my clothes all on .
 but I couldn’t a gone to sleep if I’d a wanted to , I was in such a sweat to get through with the business .
 By and by I heard the king and the duke come up .
 so I rolled off my pallet and laid with my chin at the top of my ladder , and waited to see if anything was going to happen .
 But nothing did .
 
.
So I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadn’t begun yet .
 and then I slipped down the ladder .
 
.
When I got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up , and the watchers was gone .
 There warn’t nobody around but the family and the widow Bartley and our tribe .
 I watched their faces to see if anything had been happening , but I couldn’t tell .
 
.
They buried him , and we come back home , and I went to watching faces again—I couldn’t help it , and I couldn’t rest easy .
 But nothing come of it .
 the faces didn’t tell me nothing .
 
.
Well , blamed if the king didn’t bill the house and the niggers and all the property for auction straight off—sale two days after the funeral .
 but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to .
 
.
The thing made a big stir in the town , too , and a good many come out flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the children that way .
 It injured the frauds some .
 but the old fool he bulled right along , spite of all the duke could say or do , and I tell you the duke was powerful uneasy .
 
.
Was you in my room night before last .
 
.
No , your majesty"—which was the way I always called him when nobody but our gang warn’t around .
 
.
Was you in there yisterday er last night .
 
.
No , your majesty .
 
.
Honor bright , now—no lies .
 
.
The duke says : 
.
Have you seen anybody else go in there .
 
.
Stop and think .
 
.
I studied awhile and see my chance .
 then I says : 
.
Well , I see the niggers go in there several times .
 
.
Hello .
 When was that .
 
.
Well , go on , GO on .
 What did they do .
 How’d they act .
 
.
They didn’t do nothing .
 And they didn’t act anyway much , as fur as I see .
 They tiptoed away .
 so I seen , easy enough , that they’d shoved in there to do up your majesty’s room , or something , s’posing you was up .
 and found you WARN’T up , and so they was hoping to slide out of the way of trouble without waking you up , if they hadn’t already waked you up .
 
.
In the bank for to be collected .
 Where WOULD it be .
 
.
Well , THAT’S all right then , thank goodness .
 
.
Says I , kind of timid-like : 
.
Is something gone wrong .
 
.
The king whirls on me and rips out : 
.
As they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again , and says : 
.
Quick sales AND small profits .
 It’s a good business—yes .
 
.
The king snarls around on him and says : 
.
I was trying to do for the best in sellin’ ’em out so quick .
 If the profits has turned out to be none , lackin’ considable , and none to carry , is it my fault any more’n it’s yourn .
 
.
Well , THEY’D be in this house yet and we WOULDN’T if I could a got my advice listened to .
 
.
BY and by it was getting-up time .
 So I come down the ladder and started for down-stairs .
 but as I come to the girls’ room the door was open , and I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk , which was open and she’d been packing things in it—getting ready to go to England .
 But she had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap , and had her face in her hands , crying .
 I felt awful bad to see it .
 of course anybody would .
 I went in there and says : 
.
Miss Mary Jane , you can’t a-bear to see people in trouble , and I can’t—most always .
 Tell me about it .
 
.
Miss Mary Jane , is there any place out of town a little ways where you could go and stay three or four days .
 
.
Never mind why yet .
 If I’ll tell you how I know the niggers will see each other again inside of two weeks—here in this house—and PROVE how I know it—will you go to MrLothrop’s and stay four days .
 
.
Then I come back and set down again , and says : 
.
Says I : 
.
Miss Mary Jane , I’ll tell you what we’ll do , and you won’t have to stay at MrLothrop’s so long , nuther .
 How fur is it .
 
.
A little short of four miles—right out in the country , back here .
 
.
Stand by you .
 indeed I will .
 They sha’n’t touch a hair of your head .
  she says , and I see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said it , too .
 
.
Why .
 
.
What did you reckon I wanted you to go at all for , Miss Mary .
 
.
Why , it’s because you ain’t one of these leather-face people .
 I don’t want no better book than what your face is .
 A body can set down and read it off like coarse print .
 Do you reckon you can go and face your uncles when they come to kiss you good-morning , and never—
.
Well , then , it sha’n’t be .
  It was well enough to tell HER so—no harm in it .
 It was only a little thing to do , and no trouble .
 and it’s the little things that smooths people’s roads the most , down here below .
 it would make Mary Jane comfortable , and it wouldn’t cost nothing .
 Then I says : There’s one more thing—that bag of money .
 
.
Well , they’ve got that .
 and it makes me feel pretty silly to think HOW they got it .
 
.
No , you’re out , there .
 They hain’t got it .
 
.
Oh , stop blaming yourself—it’s too bad to do it , and I won’t allow it—you couldn’t help it .
 it wasn’t your fault .
 Where did you hide it .
 
.
I’d ruther not TELL you where I put it , Miss Mary Jane , if you don’t mind letting me off .
 but I’ll write it for you on a piece of paper , and you can read it along the road to MrLothrop’s , if you want to .
 Do you reckon that ’ll do .
 
.
Oh , yes .
 
.
So I wrote : I put it in the coffin .
 It was in there when you was crying there , away in the night .
 I was behind the door , and I was mighty sorry for you , Miss Mary Jane .
 
.
It made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by herself in the night , and them devils laying there right under her own roof , shaming her and robbing her .
 and when I folded it up and give it to her I see the water come into her eyes , too .
 and she shook me by the hand , hard , and says : 
.
Pray for me .
 I reckoned if she knowed me she’d take a job that was more nearer her size .
 But I bet she done it , just the same—she was just that kind .
 She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notion—there warn’t no back-down to her , I judge .
 You may say what you want to , but in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see .
 in my opinion she was just full of sand .
 It sounds like flattery , but it ain’t no flattery .
 And when it comes to beauty—and goodness , too—she lays over them all .
 I hain’t ever seen her since that time that I see her go out of that door .
 no , I hain’t ever seen her since , but I reckon I’ve thought of her a many and a many a million times , and of her saying she would pray for me .
 and if ever I’d a thought it would do any good for me to pray for HER , blamed if I wouldn’t a done it or bust .
 
.
What’s the name of them people over on t’other side of the river that you all goes to see sometimes .
 
.
They says : 
.
That’s the name ,  I says .
 I most forgot it .
 Well , Miss Mary Jane she told me to tell you she’s gone over there in a dreadful hurry—one of them’s sick .
 
.
Which one .
 
.
Sakes alive , I hope it ain’t HANNER .
 
.
I’m sorry to say it ,  I says , but Hanner’s the very one .
 
.
It ain’t no name for it .
 They set up with her all night , Miss Mary Jane said , and they don’t think she’ll last many hours .
 
.
Only think of that , now .
 What’s the matter with her .
 
.
I couldn’t think of anything reasonable , right off that way , so I says : 
.
Mumps .
 
.
Mumps your granny .
 They don’t set up with people that’s got the mumps .
 
.
They don’t , don’t they .
 You better bet they do with THESE mumps .
 These mumps is different .
 It’s a new kind , Miss Mary Jane said .
 
.
How’s it a new kind .
 
.
Because it’s mixed up with other things .
 
.
What other things .
 
.
Well , measles , and whooping-cough , and erysiplas , and consumption , and yaller janders , and brain-fever , and I don’t know what all .
 
.
My land .
 And they call it the MUMPS .
 
.
That’s what Miss Mary Jane said .
 
.
Well , what in the nation do they call it the MUMPS for .
 
.
Why , because it IS the mumps .
 That’s what it starts with .
 
.
Well , why wouldn’t you .
 
.
Just look at it a minute , and maybe you can see .
 Hain’t your uncles obleegd to get along home to England as fast as they can .
 And do you reckon they’d be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that journey by yourselves .
 YOU know they’ll wait for you .
 So fur , so good .
 Your uncle Harvey’s a preacher , ain’t he .
 Very well , then .
 is a PREACHER going to deceive a steamboat clerk .
 is he going to deceive a SHIP CLERK .
 —so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard .
 Now YOU know he ain’t .
 What WILL he do , then .
 Why , he’ll say , ’It’s a great pity , but my church matters has got to get along the best way they can .
 for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribus-unum mumps , and so it’s my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months it takes to show on her if she’s got it .
 ’ But never mind , if you think it’s best to tell your uncle Harvey—
.
Shucks , and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good times in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Jane’s got it or not .
 Why , you talk like a muggins .
 
.
Well , anyway , maybe you’d better tell some of the neighbors .
 
.
Why , you must mean the Apthorps , ain’t it .
 
.
All right ,  they said , and cleared out to lay for their uncles , and give them the love and the kisses , and tell them the message .
 
.
THEY was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along , and a nice-looking younger one , with his right arm in a sling .
 And , my souls , how the people yelled and laughed , and kept it up .
 But I didn’t see no joke about it , and I judged it would strain the duke and the king some to see any .
 I reckoned they’d turn pale .
 But no , nary a pale did THEY turn .
 The duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up , but just went a goo-gooing around , happy and satisfied , like a jug that’s googling out buttermilk .
 and as for the king , he just gazed and gazed down sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him the stomach-ache in his very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the world .
 Oh , he done it admirable .
 Lots of the principal people gethered around the king , to let him see they was on his side .
 That old gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death .
 Pretty soon he begun to speak , and I see straight off he pronounced LIKE an Englishman—not the king’s way , though the king’s WAS pretty good for an imitation .
 I can’t give the old gent’s words , nor I can’t imitate him .
 but he turned around to the crowd , and says , about like this : 
.
So him and the new dummy started off .
 and the king he laughs , and blethers out : 
.
Say , looky here .
 if you are Harvey Wilks , when’d you come to this town .
 
.
The day before the funeral , friend ,  says the king .
 
.
But what time o’ day .
 
.
In the evenin’—’bout an hour er two before sundown .
 
.
HOW’D you come .
 
.
I come down on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati .
 
.
I warn’t up at the Pint in the mornin’ .
 
.
It’s a lie .
 
.
Several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an old man and a preacher .
 
.
Preacher be hanged , he’s a fraud and a liar .
 He was up at the Pint that mornin’ .
 I live up there , don’t I .
 Well , I was up there , and he was up there .
 I see him there .
 He come in a canoe , along with Tim Collins and a boy .
 
.
The doctor he up and says : 
.
Would you know the boy again if you was to see him , Hines .
 
.
I reckon I would , but I don’t know .
 Why , yonder he is , now .
 I know him perfectly easy .
 
.
It was me he pointed at .
 The doctor says : 
.
Neighbors , I don’t know whether the new couple is frauds or not .
 but if THESE two ain’t frauds , I am an idiot , that’s all .
 I think it’s our duty to see that they don’t get away from here till we’ve looked into this thing .
 Come along , Hines .
 come along , the rest of you .
 We’ll take these fellows to the tavern and affront them with t’other couple , and I reckon we’ll find out SOMETHING before we get through .
 
.
It was nuts for the crowd , though maybe not for the king’s friends .
 so we all started .
 It was about sundown .
 The doctor he led me along by the hand , and was plenty kind enough , but he never let go my hand .
 
.
Gentlemen , I wish the money was there , for I ain’t got no disposition to throw anything in the way of a fair , open , out-and-out investigation o’ this misable business .
 but , alas , the money ain’t there .
 you k’n send and see , if you want to .
 
.
Where is it , then .
 
.
Are YOU English , too .
 
.
I says yes .
 and him and some others laughed , and said , Stuff .
 
.
Set down , my boy .
 I wouldn’t strain myself if I was you .
 I reckon you ain’t used to lying , it don’t seem to come handy .
 what you want is practice .
 You do it pretty awkward .
 
.
I didn’t care nothing for the compliment , but I was glad to be let off , anyway .
 
.
The doctor he started to say something , and turns and says : 
.
The lawyer and him shook hands , and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased , and they talked right along awhile , and then got to one side and talked low .
 and at last the lawyer speaks up and says : 
.
That ’ll fix it .
 I’ll take the order and send it , along with your brother’s , and then they’ll know it’s all right .
 
.
You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names .
 
.
The old gentleman wrote , but nobody couldn’t read it .
 The lawyer looked powerful astonished , and says : 
.
The new old gentleman says : 
.
If you please , let me explain .
 Nobody can read my hand but my brother there—so he copies for me .
 It’s HIS hand you’ve got there , not mine .
 
.
WELL .
  says the lawyer , this IS a state of things .
 I’ve got some of William’s letters , too .
 so if you’ll get him to write a line or so we can com—
.
He CAN’T write with his left hand ,  says the old gentleman .
 If he could use his right hand , you would see that he wrote his own letters and mine too .
 Look at both , please—they’re by the same hand .
 
.
The lawyer done it , and says : 
.
I believe it’s so—and if it ain’t so , there’s a heap stronger resemblance than I’d noticed before , anyway .
 Well , well , well .
 I thought we was right on the track of a solution , but it’s gone to grass , partly .
 But anyway , one thing is proved—THESE two ain’t either of ’em Wilkses"—and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke .
 
.
Then the old man turns towards the king , and says : 
.
Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast .
 
.
Mf .
 It’s a VERY tough question , AIN’T it .
 YES , sir , I k’n tell you what’s tattooed on his breast .
 It’s jest a small , thin , blue arrow—that’s what it is .
 and if you don’t look clost , you can’t see it .
 NOW what do you say—hey .
 
.
Well , I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out cheek .
 
.
Both of them spoke up and says : 
.
We didn’t see no such mark .
 
.
Both of them spoke up again , and says : 
.
No , we DIDN’T .
 We never seen any marks at all .
 
.
Well , everybody WAS in a state of mind now , and they sings out : 
.
That took them .
 
.
Hooray .
  they all shouted , and was starting right off .
 but the lawyer and the doctor sung out : 
.
Hold on , hold on .
 Collar all these four men and the boy , and fetch THEM along , too .
 
.
We’ll do it .
  they all shouted .
 and if we don’t find them marks we’ll lynch the whole gang .
 
.
As we went by our house I wished I hadn’t sent Mary Jane out of town .
 because now if I could tip her the wink she’d light out and save me , and blow on our dead-beats .
 
.
Well , we swarmed along down the river road , just carrying on like wildcats .
 and to make it more scary the sky was darking up , and the lightning beginning to wink and flitter , and the wind to shiver amongst the leaves .
 This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever was in .
 and I was kinder stunned .
 everything was going so different from what I had allowed for .
 stead of being fixed so I could take my own time if I wanted to , and see all the fun , and have Mary Jane at my back to save me and set me free when the close-fit come , here was nothing in the world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-marks .
 If they didn’t find them—
.
I couldn’t bear to think about it .
 and yet , somehow , I couldn’t think about nothing else .
 It got darker and darker , and it was a beautiful time to give the crowd the slip .
 but that big husky had me by the wrist—Hines—and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip .
 He dragged me right along , he was so excited , and I had to run to keep up .
 
.
By the living jingo , here’s the bag of gold on his breast .
 
.
I had the road all to myself , and I fairly flew—leastways , I had it all to myself except the solid dark , and the now-and-then glares , and the buzzing of the rain , and the thrashing of the wind , and the splitting of the thunder .
 and sure as you are born I did clip it along .
 
.
Out with you , Jim , and set her loose .
 Glory be to goodness , we’re shut of them .
 
.
So in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river , and it DID seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river , and nobody to bother us .
 I had to skip around a bit , and jump up and crack my heels a few times—I couldn’t help it .
 but about the third crack I noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well , and held my breath and listened and waited .
 and sure enough , when the next flash busted out over the water , here they come .
 —and just a-laying to their oars and making their skiff hum .
 It was the king and the duke .
 
.
So I wilted right down on to the planks then , and give up .
 and it was all I could do to keep from crying .
 
.
Tryin’ to give us the slip , was ye , you pup .
 Tired of our company , hey .
 
.
I says : 
.
Quick , then , and tell us what WAS your idea , or I’ll shake the insides out o’ you .
 
.
Jim said it was so .
 and the king told him to shut up , and said , Oh , yes , it’s MIGHTY likely .
  and shook me up again , and said he reckoned he’d drownd me .
 But the duke says : 
.
Leggo the boy , you old idiot .
 Would YOU a done any different .
 Did you inquire around for HIM when you got loose .
 I don’t remember it .
 
.
So the king let go of me , and begun to cuss that town and everybody in it .
 But the duke says : 
.
You better a blame’ sight give YOURSELF a good cussing , for you’re the one that’s entitled to it most .
 You hain’t done a thing from the start that had any sense in it , except coming out so cool and cheeky with that imaginary blue-arrow mark .
 That WAS bright—it was right down bully .
 and it was the thing that saved us .
 For if it hadn’t been for that they’d a jailed us till them Englishmen’s baggage come—and then—the penitentiary , you bet .
 But that trick took ’em to the graveyard , and the gold done us a still bigger kindness .
 for if the excited fools hadn’t let go all holts and made that rush to get a look we’d a slept in our cravats to-night—cravats warranted to WEAR , too—longer than WE’D need ’em .
 
.
They was still a minute—thinking .
 then the king says , kind of absent-minded like : 
.
Mf .
 And we reckoned the NIGGERS stole it .
 
.
That made me squirm .
 
.
After about a half a minute the king drawls out : 
.
Leastways , I did .
 
.
The duke says , the same way : 
.
On the contrary , I did .
 
.
The king kind of ruffles up , and says : 
.
The duke says , pretty brisk : 
.
When it comes to that , maybe you’ll let me ask , what was YOU referring to .
 
.
The duke bristles up now , and says : 
.
Oh , let UP on this cussed nonsense .
 do you take me for a blame’ fool .
 Don’t you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffin .
 
.
YES , sir .
 I know you DO know , because you done it yourself .
 
.
It’s a lie .
 "—and the duke went for him .
 The king sings out : 
.
Take y’r hands off .
 —leggo my throat .
 —I take it all back .
 
.
The duke says : 
.
Well , you just own up , first , that you DID hide that money there , intending to give me the slip one of these days , and come back and dig it up , and have it all to yourself .
 
.
Well , then , I b’lieve you .
 But answer me only jest this one more—now DON’T git mad .
 didn’t you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide it .
 
.
The duke never said nothing for a little bit .
 then he says : 
.
The king began to gurgle , and then he gasps out : 
.
’Nough .
 —I OWN UP .
 
.
The king says , timid , and still a-snuffling : 
.
Why , duke , it was you that said make up the deffisit .
 it warn’t me .
 
.
WE dasn’t stop again at any town for days and days .
 kept right along down the river .
 We was down south in the warm weather now , and a mighty long ways from home .
 We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on them , hanging down from the limbs like long , gray beards .
 It was the first I ever see it growing , and it made the woods look solemn and dismal .
 So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger , and they begun to work the villages again .
 
.
Set her loose , Jim .
 we’re all right now .
 
.
Yes .
 
.
Whereabouts .
  says I .
 
.
Down to Silas Phelps’ place , two mile below here .
 He’s a runaway nigger , and they’ve got him .
 Was you looking for him .
 
.
Well ,  he says , you needn’t be afeard no more , becuz they’ve got him .
 He run off f’m down South , som’ers .
 
.
It’s a good job they got him .
 
.
Well , I RECKON .
 There’s two hunderd dollars reward on him .
 It’s like picking up money out’n the road .
 
.
That’s me , every time ,  says I .
 But maybe his chance ain’t worth no more than that , if he’ll sell it so cheap .
 Maybe there’s something ain’t straight about it .
 
.
HUCK FINN .
 
.
It was awful thoughts and awful words , but they was said .
 And I let them stay said .
 and never thought no more about reforming .
 I shoved the whole thing out of my head , and said I would take up wickedness again , which was in my line , being brung up to it , and the other warn’t .
 And for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again .
 and if I could think up anything worse , I would do that , too .
 because as long as I was in , and in for good , I might as well go the whole hog .
 
.
Hel-LO .
 Where’d YOU come from .
  Then he says , kind of glad and eager , Where’s the raft .
 —got her in a good place .
 
.
I says : 
.
Why , that’s just what I was going to ask your grace .
 
.
Blamed if I know—that is , what’s become of the raft .
 That old fool had made a trade and got forty dollars , and when we found him in the doggery the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but what he’d spent for whisky .
 and when I got him home late last night and found the raft gone , we said , ’That little rascal has stole our raft and shook us , and run off down the river .
 ’
.
I wouldn’t shake my NIGGER , would I .
 —the only nigger I had in the world , and the only property .
 
.
We never thought of that .
 Fact is , I reckon we’d come to consider him OUR nigger .
 yes , we did consider him so—goodness knows we had trouble enough for him .
 So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke , there warn’t anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another shake .
 And I’ve pegged along ever since , dry as a powder-horn .
 Where’s that ten cents .
 Give it here .
 
.
Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us .
 We’d skin him if he done that .
 
.
He stopped , but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes before .
 I went on a-whimpering , and says : 
.
He looked kinder bothered , and stood there with his bills fluttering on his arm , thinking , and wrinkling up his forehead .
 At last he says : 
.
I’ll tell you something .
 We got to be here three days .
 If you’ll promise you won’t blow , and won’t let the nigger blow , I’ll tell you where to find him .
 
.
So I promised , and he says : 
.
That was the order I wanted , and that was the one I played for .
 I wanted to be left free to work my plans .
 
.
So I left , and struck for the back country .
 I didn’t look around , but I kinder felt like he was watching me .
 But I knowed I could tire him out at that .
 I went straight out in the country as much as a mile before I stopped .
 then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps’ .
 I reckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without fooling around , because I wanted to stop Jim’s mouth till these fellows could get away .
 I didn’t want no trouble with their kind .
 I’d seen all I wanted to of them , and wanted to get entirely shut of them .
 
.
WHEN I got there it was all still and Sunday-like , and hot and sunshiny .
 the hands was gone to the fields .
 and there was them kind of faint dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and like everybody’s dead and gone .
 and if a breeze fans along and quivers the leaves it makes you feel mournful , because you feel like it’s spirits whispering—spirits that’s been dead ever so many years—and you always think they’re talking about YOU .
 As a general thing it makes a body wish HE was dead , too , and done with it all .
 
.
I went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper , and started for the kitchen .
 When I got a little ways I heard the dim hum of a spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again .
 and then I knowed for certain I wished I was dead—for that IS the lonesomest sound in the whole world .
 
.
A nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling-pin in her hand , singing out , Begone YOU Tige .
 you Spot .
 begone sah .
  and she fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling , and then the rest followed .
 and the next second half of them come back , wagging their tails around me , and making friends with me .
 There ain’t no harm in a hound , nohow .
 
.
I out with a Yes’m before I thought .
 
.
But they ducked their heads , and put their fingers in their mouths , and hid behind her .
 So she run on : 
.
Lize , hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away—or did you get your breakfast on the boat .
 
.
I said I had got it on the boat .
 So then she started for the house , leading me by the hand , and the children tagging after .
 When we got there she set me down in a split-bottomed chair , and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me , holding both of my hands , and says : 
.
Now I can have a GOOD look at you .
 and , laws-a-me , I’ve been hungry for it a many and a many a time , all these long years , and it’s come at last .
 We been expecting you a couple of days and more .
 What kep’ you .
 —boat get aground .
 
.
Don’t say yes’m—say Aunt Sally .
 Where’d she get aground .
 
.
It warn’t the grounding—that didn’t keep us back but a little .
 We blowed out a cylinder-head .
 
.
Good gracious .
 anybody hurt .
 
.
No’m .
 Killed a nigger .
 
.
Who’d you give the baggage to .
 
.
Nobody .
 
.
Why , child , it ’ll be stole .
 
.
Not where I hid it I reckon it won’t ,  I says .
 
.
How’d you get your breakfast so early on the boat .
 
.
It was kinder thin ice , but I says : 
.
The captain see me standing around , and told me I better have something to eat before I went ashore .
 so he took me in the texas to the officers’ lunch , and give me all I wanted .
 
.
I see I was in a fix now .
 But it warn’t no use to worry .
 there warn’t nothing to do but just hold still , and try and be ready to stand from under when the lightning struck .
 
.
I had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in .
 then the bed hid him .
 MrsPhelps she jumps for him , and says : 
.
Has he come .
 
.
No ,  says her husband .
 
.
I can’t imagine ,  says the old gentleman .
 and I must say it makes me dreadful uneasy .
 
.
Why , Sally , I COULDN’T miss him along the road—YOU know that .
 
.
Why , Silas .
 Look yonder .
 —up the road .
 —ain’t that somebody coming .
 
.
He sprung to the window at the head of the bed , and that give MrsPhelps the chance she wanted .
 She stooped down quick at the foot of the bed and give me a pull , and out I come .
 and when he turned back from the window there she stood , a-beaming and a-smiling like a house afire , and I standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside .
 The old gentleman stared , and says : 
.
Why , who’s that .
 
.
Who do you reckon ’t is .
 
.
I hain’t no idea .
 Who IS it .
 
.
It’s TOM SAWYER .
 
.
But if they was joyful , it warn’t nothing to what I was .
 for it was like being born again , I was so glad to find out who I was .
 Well , they froze to me for two hours .
 and at last , when my chin was so tired it couldn’t hardly go any more , I had told them more about my family—I mean the Sawyer family—than ever happened to any six Sawyer families .
 And I explained all about how we blowed out a cylinder-head at the mouth of White River , and it took us three days to fix it .
 Which was all right , and worked first-rate .
 because THEY didn’t know but what it would take three days to fix it .
 If I’d a called it a bolthead it would a done just as well .
 
.
Now I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side , and pretty uncomfortable all up the other .
 Being Tom Sawyer was easy and comfortable , and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear a steamboat coughing along down the river .
 Then I says to myself , s’pose Tom Sawyer comes down on that boat .
 And s’pose he steps in here any minute , and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep quiet .
 
.
I hain’t ever done you no harm .
 You know that .
 So , then , what you want to come back and ha’nt ME for .
 
.
I says : 
.
I hain’t come back—I hain’t been GONE .
 
.
When he heard my voice it righted him up some , but he warn’t quite satisfied yet .
 He says : 
.
Don’t you play nothing on me , because I wouldn’t on you .
 Honest injun , you ain’t a ghost .
 
.
Honest injun , I ain’t ,  I says .
 
.
Well—I—I—well , that ought to settle it , of course .
 but I can’t somehow seem to understand it no way .
 Looky here , warn’t you ever murdered AT ALL .
 
.
So he done it .
 and it satisfied him .
 and he was that glad to see me again he didn’t know what to do .
 And he wanted to know all about it right off , because it was a grand adventure , and mysterious , and so it hit him where he lived .
 But I said , leave it alone till by and by .
 and told his driver to wait , and we drove off a little piece , and I told him the kind of a fix I was in , and what did he reckon we better do .
 He said , let him alone a minute , and don’t disturb him .
 So he thought and thought , and pretty soon he says : 
.
I says : 
.
All right .
 but wait a minute .
 There’s one more thing—a thing that NOBODY don’t know but me .
 And that is , there’s a nigger here that I’m a-trying to steal out of slavery , and his name is JIM—old Miss Watson’s Jim .
 
.
He says : 
.
He stopped and went to studying .
 I says : 
.
I know what you’ll say .
 You’ll say it’s dirty , low-down business .
 but what if it is .
 I’m low down .
 and I’m a-going to steal him , and I want you keep mum and not let on .
 Will you .
 
.
His eye lit up , and he says : 
.
I’ll HELP you steal him .
 
.
Oh , shucks .
  I says .
 you’re joking .
 
.
I ain’t joking , either .
 
.
Why , this is wonderful .
 Whoever would a thought it was in that mare to do it .
 I wish we’d a timed her .
 And she hain’t sweated a hair—not a hair .
 It’s wonderful .
 Why , I wouldn’t take a hundred dollars for that horse now—I wouldn’t , honest .
 and yet I’d a sold her for fifteen before , and thought ’twas all she was worth .
 
.
MrArchibald Nichols , I presume .
 
.
Tom he took a look back over his shoulder , and says , Too late—he’s out of sight .
 
.
But we won’t LET you walk—it wouldn’t be Southern hospitality to do it .
 Come right in .
 
.
You owdacious puppy .
 
.
He looked kind of hurt , and says : 
.
I’m surprised at you , m’am .
 
.
You’re s’rp—Why , what do you reckon I am .
 I’ve a good notion to take and—Say , what do you mean by kissing me .
 
.
He looked kind of humble , and says : 
.
I didn’t mean nothing , m’am .
 I didn’t mean no harm .
 I—I—thought you’d like it .
 
.
Why , you born fool .
  She took up the spinning stick , and it looked like it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it .
 What made you think I’d like it .
 
.
Well , I don’t know .
 Only , they—they—told me you would .
 
.
Why , everybody .
 They all said so , m’am .
 
.
It was all she could do to hold in .
 and her eyes snapped , and her fingers worked like she wanted to scratch him .
 and she says : 
.
Who’s ’everybody’ .
 Out with their names , or ther’ll be an idiot short .
 
.
You won’t , won’t you .
 Well , I sh’d RECKON you won’t .
 
.
No’m , I’m honest about it .
 I won’t ever do it again—till you ask me .
 
.
Why , no .
 I—I—well , no , I b’lieve I didn’t .
 
.
Then he looks on around the same way to me , and says : 
.
No , not till you’ve asked me first .
 
.
So she didn’t lose no time , but asked him .
 and hugged him and kissed him over and over again , and then turned him over to the old man , and he took what was left .
 And after they got a little quiet again she says : 
.
Why , dear me , I never see such a surprise .
 We warn’t looking for YOU at all , but only Tom .
 Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but him .
 
.
Pa , mayn’t Tom and Sid and me go to the show .
 
.
We see we was too late—couldn’t do no good .
 We asked some stragglers about it , and they said everybody went to the show looking very innocent .
 and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the middle of his cavortings on the stage .
 then somebody give a signal , and the house rose up and went for them .
 
.
WE stopped talking , and got to thinking .
 By and by Tom says : 
.
Looky here , Huck , what fools we are to not think of it before .
 I bet I know where Jim is .
 
.
In that hut down by the ash-hopper .
 Why , looky here .
 When we was at dinner , didn’t you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles .
 
.
Yes .
 
.
What did you think the vittles was for .
 
.
For a dog .
 
.
So ’d I .
 Well , it wasn’t for a dog .
 
.
Why .
 
.
Because part of it was watermelon .
 
.
Yes ,  I says .
 
.
All right—bring it out .
 
.
I never said nothing , because I warn’t expecting nothing different .
 but I knowed mighty well that whenever he got HIS plan ready it wouldn’t have none of them objections to it .
 
.
And it didn’t .
 He told me what it was , and I see in a minute it was worth fifteen of mine for style , and would make Jim just as free a man as mine would , and maybe get us all killed besides .
 So I was satisfied , and said we would waltz in on it .
 I needn’t tell what it was here , because I knowed it wouldn’t stay the way , it was .
 I knowed he would be changing it around every which way as we went along , and heaving in new bullinesses wherever he got a chance .
 And that is what he done .
 
.
Don’t you reckon I know what I’m about .
 Don’t I generly know what I’m about .
 
.
Yes .
 
.
Didn’t I SAY I was going to help steal the nigger .
 
.
Yes .
 
.
WELL , then .
 
.
That’s all he said , and that’s all I said .
 It warn’t no use to say any more .
 because when he said he’d do a thing , he always done it .
 But I couldn’t make out how he was willing to go into this thing .
 so I just let it go , and never bothered no more about it .
 If he was bound to have it so , I couldn’t help it .
 
.
When we got home the house was all dark and still .
 so we went on down to the hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it .
 We went through the yard so as to see what the hounds would do .
 They knowed us , and didn’t make no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by in the night .
 When we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and the two sides .
 and on the side I warn’t acquainted with—which was the north side—we found a square window-hole , up tolerable high , with just one stout board nailed across it .
 I says : 
.
Here’s the ticket .
 This hole’s big enough for Jim to get through if we wrench off the board .
 
.
Tom says : 
.
In the morning we was up at break of day , and down to the nigger cabins to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim—if it WAS Jim that was being fed .
 The niggers was just getting through breakfast and starting for the fields .
 and Jim’s nigger was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and things .
 and whilst the others was leaving , the key come from the house .
 
.
This nigger had a good-natured , chuckle-headed face , and his wool was all tied up in little bunches with thread .
 That was to keep witches off .
 He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights , and making him see all kinds of strange things , and hear all kinds of strange words and noises , and he didn’t believe he was ever witched so long before in his life .
 He got so worked up , and got to running on so about his troubles , he forgot all about what he’d been a-going to do .
 So Tom says : 
.
What’s the vittles for .
 Going to feed the dogs .
 
.
Yes , Mars Sid , A dog .
 Cur’us dog , too .
 Does you want to go en look at ’im .
 
.
Yes .
 
.
I hunched Tom , and whispers : 
.
You going , right here in the daybreak .
 THAT warn’t the plan .
 
.
No , it warn’t .
 but it’s the plan NOW .
 
.
Why , HUCK .
 En good LAN’ .
 ain’ dat Misto Tom .
 
.
Why , de gracious sakes .
 do he know you genlmen .
 
.
We could see pretty well now .
 Tom he looked at the nigger , steady and kind of wondering , and says : 
.
Does WHO know us .
 
.
Why , dis-yer runaway nigger .
 
.
I don’t reckon he does .
 but what put that into your head .
 
.
What PUT it dar .
 Didn’ he jis’ dis minute sing out like he knowed you .
 
.
Tom says , in a puzzled-up kind of way : 
.
Well , that’s mighty curious .
 WHO sung out .
 WHEN did he sing out .
 WHAT did he sing out .
  And turns to me , perfectly ca’m , and says , Did YOU hear anybody sing out .
 
.
No .
 I ain’t heard nobody say nothing .
 
.
Did you sing out .
 
.
No , sah ,  says Jim .
 I hain’t said nothing , sah .
 
.
Not a word .
 
.
Did you ever see us before .
 
.
No , sah .
 not as I knows on .
 
.
What do you reckon’s the matter with you , anyway .
 What made you think somebody sung out .
 
.
Tom give him a dime , and said we wouldn’t tell nobody .
 and told him to buy some more thread to tie up his wool with .
 and then looks at Jim , and says : 
.
I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger .
 If I was to catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away , I wouldn’t give him up , I’d hang him .
  And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good , he whispers to Jim and says : 
.
Don’t ever let on to know us .
 And if you hear any digging going on nights , it’s us .
 we’re going to set you free .
 
.
Jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it .
 then the nigger come back , and we said we’d come again some time if the nigger wanted us to .
 and he said he would , more particular if it was dark , because the witches went for him mostly in the dark , and it was good to have folks around then .
 
.
What do we want of a saw .
 
.
What do we WANT of a saw .
 Hain’t we got to saw the leg of Jim’s bed off , so as to get the chain loose .
 
.
Why , you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain off .
 
.
Well , if that ain’t just like you , Huck Finn .
 You CAN get up the infant-schooliest ways of going at a thing .
 Why , hain’t you ever read any books at all .
 —Baron Trenck , nor Casanova , nor Benvenuto Chelleeny , nor Henri IV .
 , nor none of them heroes .
 Who ever heard of getting a prisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that .
 No .
 the way all the best authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two , and leave it just so , and swallow the sawdust , so it can’t be found , and put some dirt and grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal can’t see no sign of it’s being sawed , and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound .
 Then , the night you’re ready , fetch the leg a kick , down she goes .
 slip off your chain , and there you are .
 Nothing to do but hitch your rope ladder to the battlements , shin down it , break your leg in the moat—because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short , you know—and there’s your horses and your trusty vassles , and they scoop you up and fling you across a saddle , and away you go to your native Langudoc , or Navarre , or wherever it is .
 It’s gaudy , Huck .
 I wish there was a moat to this cabin .
 If we get time , the night of the escape , we’ll dig one .
 
.
I says : 
.
What do we want of a moat when we’re going to snake him out from under the cabin .
 
.
But he never heard me .
 He had forgot me and everything else .
 He had his chin in his hand , thinking .
 Pretty soon he sighs and shakes his head .
 then sighs again , and says : 
.
No , it wouldn’t do—there ain’t necessity enough for it .
 
.
Why , to saw Jim’s leg off ,  he says .
 
.
Good land .
  I says .
 why , there ain’t NO necessity for it .
 And what would you want to saw his leg off for , anyway .
 
.
Well , some of the best authorities has done it .
 They couldn’t get the chain off , so they just cut their hand off and shoved .
 And a leg would be better still .
 But we got to let that go .
 There ain’t necessity enough in this case .
 and , besides , Jim’s a nigger , and wouldn’t understand the reasons for it , and how it’s the custom in Europe .
 so we’ll let it go .
 But there’s one thing—he can have a rope ladder .
 we can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough .
 And we can send it to him in a pie .
 it’s mostly done that way .
 And I’ve et worse pies .
 
.
Why , Tom Sawyer , how you talk ,  I says .
 Jim ain’t got no use for a rope ladder .
 
.
What in the nation can he DO with it .
 
.
DO with it .
 He can hide it in his bed , can’t he .
 That’s what they all do .
 and HE’S got to , too .
 Huck , you don’t ever seem to want to do anything that’s regular .
 you want to be starting something fresh all the time .
 S’pose he DON’T do nothing with it .
 ain’t it there in his bed , for a clew , after he’s gone .
 and don’t you reckon they’ll want clews .
 Of course they will .
 And you wouldn’t leave them any .
 That would be a PRETTY howdy-do , WOULDN’T it .
 I never heard of such a thing .
 
.
Well , all right , Tom , fix it your own way .
 but if you’ll take my advice , you’ll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline .
 
.
He said that would do .
 And that gave him another idea , and he says : 
.
Borrow a shirt , too .
 
.
What do we want of a shirt , Tom .
 
.
Want it for Jim to keep a journal on .
 
.
Journal your granny—JIM can’t write .
 
.
Why , Tom , we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better one .
 and quicker , too .
 
.
PRISONERS don’t have geese running around the donjon-keep to pull pens out of , you muggins .
 They ALWAYS make their pens out of the hardest , toughest , troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or something like that they can get their hands on .
 and it takes them weeks and weeks and months and months to file it out , too , because they’ve got to do it by rubbing it on the wall .
 THEY wouldn’t use a goose-quill if they had it .
 It ain’t regular .
 
.
Well , then , what’ll we make him the ink out of .
 
.
Jim ain’t got no tin plates .
 They feed him in a pan .
 
.
That ain’t nothing .
 we can get him some .
 
.
Can’t nobody READ his plates .
 
.
That ain’t got anything to DO with it , Huck Finn .
 All HE’S got to do is to write on the plate and throw it out .
 You don’t HAVE to be able to read it .
 Why , half the time you can’t read anything a prisoner writes on a tin plate , or anywhere else .
 
.
Well , then , what’s the sense in wasting the plates .
 
.
Why , blame it all , it ain’t the PRISONER’S plates .
 
.
But it’s SOMEBODY’S plates , ain’t it .
 
.
He broke off there , because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing .
 So we cleared out for the house .
 
.
Well , as I was saying , we waited that morning till everybody was settled down to business , and nobody in sight around the yard .
 then Tom he carried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep watch .
 By and by he come out , and we went and set down on the woodpile to talk .
 He says : 
.
Everything’s all right now except tools .
 and that’s easy fixed .
 
.
Tools .
  I says .
 
.
Yes .
 
.
Tools for what .
 
.
Why , to dig with .
 We ain’t a-going to GNAW him out , are we .
 
.
Ain’t them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a nigger out with .
  I says .
 
.
Huck Finn , did you EVER hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels , and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with .
 Now I want to ask you—if you got any reasonableness in you at all—what kind of a show would THAT give him to be a hero .
 Why , they might as well lend him the key and done with it .
 Picks and shovels—why , they wouldn’t furnish ’em to a king .
 
.
A couple of case-knives .
 
.
To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with .
 
.
Yes .
 
.
Confound it , it’s foolish , Tom .
 
.
I don’t know .
 
.
Well , guess .
 
.
JIM don’t know nobody in China .
 
.
What’s THAT got to do with it .
 Neither did that other fellow .
 But you’re always a-wandering off on a side issue .
 Why can’t you stick to the main point .
 
.
All right—I don’t care where he comes out , so he COMES out .
 and Jim don’t , either , I reckon .
 But there’s one thing , anyway—Jim’s too old to be dug out with a case-knife .
 He won’t last .
 
.
Yes he will LAST , too .
 You don’t reckon it’s going to take thirty-seven years to dig out through a DIRT foundation , do you .
 
.
How long will it take , Tom .
 
.
Smouch three ,  he says .
 we want one to make a saw out of .
 
.
Tom , if it ain’t unregular and irreligious to sejest it ,  I says , there’s an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under the weather-boarding behind the smoke-house .
 
.
He looked kind of weary and discouraged-like , and says : 
.
It ain’t no use to try to learn you nothing , Huck .
 Run along and smouch the knives—three of them .
  So I done it .
 
.
He never said nothing .
 But he sighed , and pretty soon he stopped digging , and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking .
 Then he says : 
.
Well , then , what we going to do , Tom .
 
.
He had his own by him , but I handed him mine .
 He flung it down , and says : 
.
Gimme a CASE-KNIFE .
 
.
He was always just that particular .
 Full of principle .
 
.
So he done it .
 
.
Now , the thing to study out is , how to get the things to Jim .
 
.
Take them in through the hole ,  I says , when we get it done .
 
.
NOW I know how to fix it .
 We’ll send you some things by them .
 
.
Tom says : 
.
Well , then , I’ll have to make it myself .
 
.
Will you do it , honey .
 —will you .
 I’ll wusshup de groun’ und’ yo’ foot , I will .
 
.
All right , I’ll do it , seeing it’s you , and you’ve been good to us and showed us the runaway nigger .
 But you got to be mighty careful .
 When we come around , you turn your back .
 and then whatever we’ve put in the pan , don’t you let on you see it at all .
 And don’t you look when Jim unloads the pan—something might happen , I don’t know what .
 And above all , don’t you HANDLE the witch-things .
 
.
I’ve hunted high and I’ve hunted low , and it does beat all what HAS become of your other shirt .
 
.
Why , what else is gone , Sally .
 
.
Oh , I wouldn’t hurry .
 next year ’ll do .
 Matilda Angelina Araminta PHELPS .
 
.
Whack comes the thimble , and the child snatches her claws out of the sugar-bowl without fooling around any .
 Just then the nigger woman steps on to the passage , and says : 
.
Missus , dey’s a sheet gone .
 
.
A SHEET gone .
 Well , for the land’s sake .
 
.
I’ll stop up them holes to-day ,  says Uncle Silas , looking sorrowful .
 
.
Oh , DO shet up .
 —s’pose the rats took the SHEET .
 WHERE’S it gone , Lize .
 
.
Missus ,  comes a young yaller wench , dey’s a brass cannelstick miss’n .
 
.
Cler out from here , you hussy , er I’ll take a skillet to ye .
 
.
Oh , for the land’s sake .
 Give a body a rest .
 Go ’long now , the whole kit and biling of ye .
 and don’t come nigh me again till I’ve got back my peace of mind .
 
.
Well , for the life of me I can’t remember when I done it .
 I could show her now that I warn’t to blame on account of the rats .
 But never mind—let it go .
 I reckon it wouldn’t do no good .
 
.
And so he went on a-mumbling up stairs , and then we left .
 He was a mighty nice old man .
 And always is .
 
.
Why , Aunt Sally , there ain’t but nine spoons YET .
 
.
She says : 
.
Well , I’ve counted them twice , Aunty , and I can’t make but nine .
 
.
She looked out of all patience , but of course she come to count—anybody would .
 
.
So I slipped back the one I had , and when she got done counting , she says : 
.
Hang the troublesome rubbage , ther’s TEN now .
  and she looked huffy and bothered both .
 But Tom says : 
.
Why , Aunty , I don’t think there’s ten .
 
.
You numskull , didn’t you see me COUNT ’m .
 
.
Well , I’ll count ’m AGAIN .
 
.
So we was all right now , as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and the candles , by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up counting .
 and as to the candlestick , it warn’t no consequence , it would blow over by and by .
 
.
But that pie was a job .
 we had no end of trouble with that pie .
 We fixed it up away down in the woods , and cooked it there .
 and we got it done at last , and very satisfactory , too .
 but not all in one day .
 and we had to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through , and we got burnt pretty much all over , in places , and eyes put out with the smoke .
 because , you see , we didn’t want nothing but a crust , and we couldn’t prop it up right , and she would always cave in .
 But of course we thought of the right way at last—which was to cook the ladder , too , in the pie .
 So then we laid in with Jim the second night , and tore up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together , and long before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person with .
 We let on it took nine months to make it .
 
.
And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods , but it wouldn’t go into the pie .
 Being made of a whole sheet , that way , there was rope enough for forty pies if we’d a wanted them , and plenty left over for soup , or sausage , or anything you choose .
 We could a had a whole dinner .
 
.
Jim says : 
.
Why , Mars Tom , I hain’t got no coat o’ arm .
 I hain’t got nuffn but dish yer ole shirt , en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat .
 
.
Oh , you don’t understand , Jim .
 a coat of arms is very different .
 
.
So whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece , Jim a-making his’n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon , Tom set to work to think out the coat of arms .
 By and by he said he’d struck so many good ones he didn’t hardly know which to take , but there was one which he reckoned he’d decide on .
 He says : 
.
We ain’t got no time to bother over that ,  he says .
 we got to dig in like all git-out .
 
.
Well , anyway ,  I says , what’s SOME of it .
 What’s a fess .
 
.
Oh , I don’t know .
 But he’s got to have it .
 All the nobility does .
 
.
1 .
 Here a captive heart busted .
 
.
2 .
 Here a poor prisoner , forsook by the world and friends , fretted his sorrowful life .
 
.
3 .
 Here a lonely heart broke , and a worn spirit went to its rest , after thirty-seven years of solitary captivity .
 
.
4 .
 Here , homeless and friendless , after thirty-seven years of bitter captivity , perished a noble stranger , natural son of Louis XIV .
 
.
Come to think , the logs ain’t a-going to do .
 they don’t have log walls in a dungeon : we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock .
 We’ll fetch a rock .
 
.
Jim said the rock was worse than the logs .
 he said it would take him such a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn’t ever get out .
 But Tom said he would let me help him do it .
 Then he took a look to see how me and Jim was getting along with the pens .
 It was most pesky tedious hard work and slow , and didn’t give my hands no show to get well of the sores , and we didn’t seem to make no headway , hardly .
 so Tom says : 
.
You got any spiders in here , Jim .
 
.
All right , we’ll get you some .
 
.
But bless you , honey , I doan’ WANT none .
 I’s afeard un um .
 I jis’ ’s soon have rattlesnakes aroun’ .
 
.
Tom thought a minute or two , and says : 
.
Keep what , Mars Tom .
 
.
Why , a rattlesnake .
 
.
De goodness gracious alive , Mars Tom .
 Why , if dey was a rattlesnake to come in heah I’d take en bust right out thoo dat log wall , I would , wid my head .
 
.
Why , Jim , you wouldn’t be afraid of it after a little .
 You could tame it .
 
.
TAME it .
 
.
PLEASE , Mars Tom—DOAN’ talk so .
 I can’t STAN’ it .
 He’d LET me shove his head in my mouf—fer a favor , hain’t it .
 I lay he’d wait a pow’ful long time ’fo’ I AST him .
 En mo’ en dat , I doan’ WANT him to sleep wid me .
 
.
Why , Mars Tom , I doan’ WANT no sich glory .
 Snake take ’n bite Jim’s chin off , den WHAH is de glory .
 No , sah , I doan’ want no sich doin’s .
 
.
Blame it , can’t you TRY .
 I only WANT you to try—you needn’t keep it up if it don’t work .
 
.
I k’n stan’ DEM , Mars Tom , but blame’ ’f I couldn’ get along widout um , I tell you dat .
 I never knowed b’fo’ ’t was so much bother and trouble to be a prisoner .
 
.
Well , it ALWAYS is when it’s done right .
 You got any rats around here .
 
.
No , sah , I hain’t seed none .
 
.
Well , we’ll get you some rats .
 
.
But , Jim , you GOT to have ’em—they all do .
 So don’t make no more fuss about it .
 Prisoners ain’t ever without rats .
 There ain’t no instance of it .
 And they train them , and pet them , and learn them tricks , and they get to be as sociable as flies .
 But you got to play music to them .
 You got anything to play music on .
 
.
I ain’ got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o’ paper , en a juice-harp .
 but I reck’n dey wouldn’ take no stock in a juice-harp .
 
.
Yes , DEY will , I reck’n , Mars Tom , but what kine er time is JIM havin’ .
 Blest if I kin see de pint .
 But I’ll do it ef I got to .
 I reck’n I better keep de animals satisfied , en not have no trouble in de house .
 
.
Tom waited to think it over , and see if there wasn’t nothing else .
 and pretty soon he says : 
.
Oh , there’s one thing I forgot .
 Could you raise a flower here , do you reckon .
 
.
Well , you try it , anyway .
 Some other prisoners has done it .
 
.
One er dem big cat-tail-lookin’ mullen-stalks would grow in heah , Mars Tom , I reck’n , but she wouldn’t be wuth half de trouble she’d coss .
 
.
Why , I got plenty spring water , Mars Tom .
 
.
Why , Mars Tom , I lay I kin raise one er dem mullen-stalks twyste wid spring water whiles another man’s a START’N one wid tears .
 
.
That ain’t the idea .
 You GOT to do it with tears .
 
.
She’ll die on my han’s , Mars Tom , she sholy will .
 kase I doan’ skasely ever cry .
 
.
What’s them .
  I says .
 
.
But looky here , Tom , what do we want to WARN anybody for that something’s up .
 Let them find it out for themselves—it’s their lookout .
 
.
Yes , I know .
 but you can’t depend on them .
 It’s the way they’ve acted from the very start—left us to do EVERYTHING .
 They’re so confiding and mullet-headed they don’t take notice of nothing at all .
 So if we don’t GIVE them notice there won’t be nobody nor nothing to interfere with us , and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape ’ll go off perfectly flat .
 won’t amount to nothing—won’t be nothing TO it .
 
.
Well , as for me , Tom , that’s the way I’d like .
 
.
Shucks .
  he says , and looked disgusted .
 So I says : 
.
But I ain’t going to make no complaint .
 Any way that suits you suits me .
 What you going to do about the servant-girl .
 
.
You’ll be her .
 You slide in , in the middle of the night , and hook that yaller girl’s frock .
 
.
All right , then , I’ll do it .
 but I could carry it just as handy in my own togs .
 
.
You wouldn’t look like a servant-girl THEN , would you .
 
.
No , but there won’t be nobody to see what I look like , ANYWAY .
 
.
That ain’t got nothing to do with it .
 The thing for us to do is just to do our DUTY , and not worry about whether anybody SEES us do it or not .
 Hain’t you got no principle at all .
 
.
All right , I ain’t saying nothing .
 I’m the servant-girl .
 Who’s Jim’s mother .
 
.
I’m his mother .
 I’ll hook a gown from Aunt Sally .
 
.
Well , then , you’ll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim leaves .
 
.
Not much .
 I’ll stuff Jim’s clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed to represent his mother in disguise , and Jim ’ll take the nigger woman’s gown off of me and wear it , and we’ll all evade together .
 When a prisoner of style escapes it’s called an evasion .
 It’s always called so when a king escapes , f’rinstance .
 And the same with a king’s son .
 it don’t make no difference whether he’s a natural one or an unnatural one .
 
.
Beware .
 Trouble is brewing .
 Keep a sharp lookout .
 UNKNOWN FRIEND .
 
.
Where’s the butter .
 
.
Well , you LEFT it laid out , then—it ain’t here .
 
.
We can get along without it ,  I says .
 
.
You been down cellar .
 
.
Yes’m .
 
.
What you been doing down there .
 
.
Noth’n .
 
.
NOTH’N .
 
.
No’m .
 
.
Well , then , what possessed you to go down there this time of night .
 
.
I don’t know ’m .
 
.
You don’t KNOW .
 Don’t answer me that way .
 Tom , I want to know what you been DOING down there .
 
.
I reckoned she’d let me go now , and as a generl thing she would .
 but I s’pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat about every little thing that warn’t yard-stick straight .
 so she says , very decided : 
.
You just march into that setting-room and stay there till I come .
 You been up to something you no business to , and I lay I’ll find out what it is before I’M done with you .
 
.
Hurry .
 HURRY .
  I says .
 Where’s Jim .
 
.
Right at your elbow .
 if you reach out your arm you can touch him .
 He’s dressed , and everything’s ready .
 Now we’ll slide out and give the sheep-signal .
 
.
I TOLD you we’d be too soon .
 they haven’t come—the door is locked .
 Here , I’ll lock some of you into the cabin , and you lay for ’em in the dark and kill ’em when they come .
 and the rest scatter around a piece , and listen if you can hear ’em coming .
 
.
Who’s that .
 Answer , or I’ll shoot .
 
.
Here they are .
 They’ve broke for the river .
 After ’em , boys , and turn loose the dogs .
 
.
En a mighty good job it wuz , too , Huck .
 It ’uz planned beautiful , en it ’uz done beautiful .
 en dey ain’t NOBODY kin git up a plan dat’s mo’ mixed-up en splendid den what dat one wuz .
 
.
We was all glad as we could be , but Tom was the gladdest of all because he had a bullet in the calf of his leg .
 
.
When me and Jim heard that we didn’t feel so brash as what we did before .
 It was hurting him considerable , and bleeding .
 so we laid him in the wigwam and tore up one of the duke’s shirts for to bandage him , but he says : 
.
Gimme the rags .
 I can do it myself .
 Don’t stop now .
 don’t fool around here , and the evasion booming along so handsome .
 man the sweeps , and set her loose .
 Boys , we done it elegant .
 —’deed we did .
 I wish WE’D a had the handling of Louis XVI .
 , there wouldn’t a been no ’Son of Saint Louis , ascend to heaven .
 ’ wrote down in HIS biography .
 no , sir , we’d a whooped him over the BORDER—that’s what we’d a done with HIM—and done it just as slick as nothing at all , too .
 Man the sweeps—man the sweeps .
 
.
But me and Jim was consulting—and thinking .
 And after we’d thought a minute , I says : 
.
Say it , Jim .
 
.
So he says : 
.
I knowed he was white inside , and I reckoned he’d say what he did say—so it was all right now , and I told Tom I was a-going for a doctor .
 He raised considerable row about it , but me and Jim stuck to it and wouldn’t budge .
 so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself .
 but we wouldn’t let him .
 Then he give us a piece of his mind , but it didn’t do no good .
 
.
So when he sees me getting the canoe ready , he says : 
.
Who is your folks .
  he says .
 
.
The Phelpses , down yonder .
 
.
Oh ,  he says .
 And after a minute , he says : 
.
How’d you say he got shot .
 
.
Singular dream ,  he says .
 
.
Why , me and Sid , and—and—and THE GUNS .
 that’s what I mean .
 
.
Oh ,  he says .
 
.
I struck an idea pretty soon .
 I says to myself , spos’n he can’t fix that leg just in three shakes of a sheep’s tail , as the saying is .
 spos’n it takes him three or four days .
 What are we going to do .
 -lay around there till he lets the cat out of the bag .
 No , sir .
 I know what I’LL do .
 I’ll wait , and when he comes back if he says he’s got to go any more I’ll get down there , too , if I swim .
 and we’ll take and tie him , and keep him , and shove out down the river .
 and when Tom’s done with him we’ll give him what it’s worth , or all we got , and then let him get ashore .
 
.
So then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep .
 and next time I waked up the sun was away up over my head .
 I shot out and went for the doctor’s house , but they told me he’d gone away in the night some time or other , and warn’t back yet .
 Well , thinks I , that looks powerful bad for Tom , and I’ll dig out for the island right off .
 So away I shoved , and turned the corner , and nearly rammed my head into Uncle Silas’s stomach .
 He says : 
.
Why , TOM .
 Where you been all this time , you rascal .
 
.
Why , where ever did you go .
  he says .
 Your aunt’s been mighty uneasy .
 
.
And the place was plum full of farmers and farmers’ wives , to dinner .
 and such another clack a body never heard .
 Old MrsHotchkiss was the worst .
 her tongue was a-going all the time .
 She says : 
.
My very WORDS , Brer Penrod .
 I was a-sayin’—pass that-air sasser o’ m’lasses , won’t ye .
 —I was a-sayin’ to Sister Dunlap , jist this minute , how DID they git that grindstone in there , s’I .
 Without HELP , mind you—’thout HELP .
 THAT’S wher ’tis .
 Don’t tell ME , s’I .
 there WUZ help , s’I .
 ’n’ ther’ wuz a PLENTY help , too , s’I .
 ther’s ben a DOZEN a-helpin’ that nigger , ’n’ I lay I’d skin every last nigger on this place but I’D find out who done it , s’I .
 ’n’ moreover , s’I—
.
I’ll run right up to town and get him ,  I says .
 
.
No you won’t ,  she says .
 You’ll stay right wher’ you are .
 ONE’S enough to be lost at a time .
 If he ain’t here to supper , your uncle ’ll go .
 
.
He come back about ten a little bit uneasy .
 hadn’t run across Tom’s track .
 Aunt Sally was a good DEAL uneasy .
 but Uncle Silas he said there warn’t no occasion to be—boys will be boys , he said , and you’ll see this one turn up in the morning all sound and right .
 So she had to be satisfied .
 But she said she’d set up for him a while anyway , and keep a light burning so he could see it .
 
.
The door ain’t going to be locked , Tom , and there’s the window and the rod .
 but you’ll be good , WON’T you .
 And you won’t go .
 For MY sake .
 
.
Laws knows I WANTED to go bad enough to see about Tom , and was all intending to go .
 but after that I wouldn’t a went , not for kingdoms .
 
.
Did I give you the letter .
 
.
What letter .
 
.
The one I got yesterday out of the post-office .
 
.
No , you didn’t give me no letter .
 
.
Well , I must a forgot it .
 
.
Why , it’s from StPetersburg—it’s from Sis .
 
.
And Tom he turned his head a little , and muttered something or other , which showed he warn’t in his right mind .
 then she flung up her hands , and says : 
.
Somebody says : 
.
Well , it sounds very good , doctor , I’m obleeged to say .
 
.
Hello .
 —why , I’m at HOME .
 How’s that .
 Where’s the raft .
 
.
It’s all right ,  I says .
 
.
And JIM .
 
.
The same ,  I says , but couldn’t say it pretty brash .
 But he never noticed , but says : 
.
Why , about the way the whole thing was done .
 
.
What whole thing .
 
.
Why , THE whole thing .
 There ain’t but one .
 how we set the runaway nigger free—me and Tom .
 
.
Good land .
 Set the run—What IS the child talking about .
 Dear , dear , out of his head again .
 
.
Mercy sakes .
 
.
Well , I never heard the likes of it in all my born days .
 So it was YOU , you little rapscallions , that’s been making all this trouble , and turned everybody’s wits clean inside out and scared us all most to death .
 I’ve as good a notion as ever I had in my life to take it out o’ you this very minute .
 To think , here I’ve been , night after night , a—YOU just get well once , you young scamp , and I lay I’ll tan the Old Harry out o’ both o’ ye .
 
.
WELL , you get all the enjoyment you can out of it NOW , for mind I tell you if I catch you meddling with him again—
.
Meddling with WHO .
  Tom says , dropping his smile and looking surprised .
 
.
With WHO .
 Why , the runaway nigger , of course .
 Who’d you reckon .
 
.
Tom looks at me very grave , and says : 
.
Tom , didn’t you just tell me he was all right .
 Hasn’t he got away .
 
.
What DOES the child mean .
 
.
I mean every word I SAY , Aunt Sally , and if somebody don’t go , I’LL go .
 I’ve knowed him all his life , and so has Tom , there .
 Old Miss Watson died two months ago , and she was ashamed she ever was going to sell him down the river , and SAID so .
 and she set him free in her will .
 
.
Then what on earth did YOU want to set him free for , seeing he was already free .
 
.
Well , that IS a question , I must say .
 and just like women .
 Why , I wanted the ADVENTURE of it .
 and I’d a waded neck-deep in blood to—goodness alive , AUNT POLLY .
 
.
If she warn’t standing right there , just inside the door , looking as sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie , I wish I may never .
 
.
Yes , you BETTER turn y’r head away—I would if I was you , Tom .
 
.
Oh , deary me .
  says Aunt Sally .
 IS he changed so .
 Why , that ain’t TOM , it’s Sid .
 Tom’s—Tom’s—why , where is Tom .
 He was here a minute ago .
 
.
You mean where’s Huck FINN—that’s what you mean .
 I reckon I hain’t raised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not to know him when I SEE him .
 That WOULD be a pretty howdy-do .
 Come out from under that bed , Huck Finn .
 
.
So I done it .
 But not feeling brash .
 
.
And his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson setting Jim free in her will .
 and so , sure enough , Tom Sawyer had gone and took all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free .
 and I couldn’t ever understand before , until that minute and that talk , how he COULD help a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up .
 
.
Well , Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom and SID had come all right and safe , she says to herself : 
.
Look at that , now .
 I might have expected it , letting him go off that way without anybody to watch him .
 So now I got to go and trapse all the way down the river , eleven hundred mile , and find out what that creetur’s up to THIS time , as long as I couldn’t seem to get any answer out of you about it .
 
.
Why , I never heard nothing from you ,  says Aunt Sally .
 
.
Well , I wonder .
 Why , I wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean by Sid being here .
 
.
Well , I never got ’em , Sis .
 
.
Aunt Polly she turns around slow and severe , and says : 
.
You , Tom .
 
.
Well—WHAT .
  he says , kind of pettish .
 
.
What letters .
 
.
They’re in the trunk .
 There , now .
 And they’re just the same as they was when I got them out of the office .
 I hain’t looked into them , I hain’t touched them .
 But I knowed they’d make trouble , and I thought if you warn’t in no hurry , I’d—
.
Well , you DO need skinning , there ain’t no mistake about it .
 And I wrote another one to tell you I was coming .
 and I s’pose he—
.
I wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn’t , but I reckoned maybe it was just as safe to not to .
 So I never said nothing .
 
.
No , he hain’t ,  Tom says .
 it’s all there yet—six thousand dollars and more .
 and your pap hain’t ever been back since .
 Hadn’t when I come away , anyhow .
 
.
Jim says , kind of solemn : 
.
He ain’t a-comin’ back no mo’ , Huck .
 
.
I says : 
.
Why , Jim .
 
.
Nemmine why , Huck—but he ain’t comin’ back no mo .
 
.
